                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 8 August 2001. This is an interview with Theresa
                        A. Loar. Do you pronounce it “Lore?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that's T-H-E-R-E-S-A, and then A, and then L-O-A-R.
                        This is being done by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training,
                        and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. And you go by Theresa, don't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Theresa, let's start at the beginning. Could you tell me
                        when and where you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I was born in New Jersey on March 23, 1954. I was born into a wonderful,
                    large, Irish Catholic family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your family name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Loar - Loar is my maiden name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Loar?maiden name, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, and there are seven children. I am number five of five girls and two
                    boys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, [sigh]?the poor kids, boys, I mean. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, they're great guys! They're at opposite ends of the family, and they're
                    just wonderful guys. I grew up in New Jersey and attended Catholic schools all
                    the way through high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk first about your father. What was your
                        father doing and his family background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: My dad's family had come from Ireland at some point in the past and settled
                    in Columbus, Ohio. During the Depression, he and his 10 or 11 brothers and
                    sisters all moved east and started from scratch. My father worked in the post
                    office for many years. He actually worked in the post office at Newark Airport,
                    so he had a hazardous drive from our house to Newark Airport [laughter] every
                    night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: He worked the night shift. He also did second jobs in lumber shops and
                    other places. With a family of seven, you can imagine that was necessary to
                    do!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my! Yes, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But my dad had a very keen interest in world affairs. He dropped out of
                    school in probably about eighth grade, and was very opinionated, with a very
                    strong point of view about politics. Obviously, we were Catholics first, Irish
                    second, and Democrats third. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I always felt very fortunate to have those sensibilities, and being
                    exposed to those sensibilities. My dad read two or three newspapers a day. He'd
                    go to libraries since he was too frugal to actually purchase a lot of
                    newspapers. But he was very interested in what was going on in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>LOAR: My mom came from a wonderful family - McCabes. Her parents came from
                    Ireland. They grew up in New York and were a fabulous close family. We're still
                    very close to the surviving four siblings. Their parents died quite young. So,
                    the oldest brother, my Uncle Jimmy, James J. McCabe, my mother's oldest brother,
                    dropped out of school in mid high school to take care of the family and really
                    was a great example for the family because he really took care of the family and
                    made sure all the kids got educated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What was he doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I don't know how he did this to help support the family; but, he did make
                    sure that my mother finished high school and that some of the others actually
                    went to college, which was very nice. And then my uncle, who is my Uncle Jim
                    went to college and law school at night, and ended up joining USAID (United
                    States Agency for International Development) in the Foreign Service, and served
                    overseas in Japan after the war to help rebuild Japan. And I think that's what
                    gave me the idea this would be an interesting thing to do. It kind of stayed in
                    my mind. But there was a very strong sense in that family that you took care of
                    each other. He was always very interested in our family, as my mother's other
                    brothers and sister were. This was a very strong type feeling that we were part
                    of a larger family that cared a lot about us and expected us to do good things
                    and help people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your mother as interested as your father in
                        international, and national affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No, my mom was, you know, really devoted to ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was having kids! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?having kids [laughter]. She didn't drive, and was in this little town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What little town was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Iselin, New Jersey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I-S -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I-S-E-L-I-N</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?which was a little, tiny town that, when the metro station,
                    Metropark/Amtrak station moved in, grew into the town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But, she was really focused on the kids, and we, I think, kept giving her a
                    run for her money that way. She had a great sense of humor and still keeps in
                    touch every day. If I want to know what's going on with one of my sisters or
                    brothers, my mother will know - at 84 years old! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We're very lucky to have her!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to what - Catholic school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Catholic grammar school nearby. I had to take a public service bus 45
                    minutes away to go to the Catholic high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the grammar school, was it run by nuns at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, it most certainly was! Saint Cecilia's Grammar School</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me?tell me about the nuns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, I mean one hears stories that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter] Here's a real one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go on!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, as you can imagine, I mean my family, we really did have a very
                    strong Catholic upbringing, especially at the social justice part of it, and
                    that did come from my parents. It came from my mother's extended family who had
                    this philosophy that you're really here to help people, and do what you're
                    supposed to do to help people.</p>
                <p>It was a big, big school, very strict. I feel lucky that I learned good manners
                    and right from wrong. We had Dominican nuns, and the nuns were really
                    interesting, and [sigh] at some point I sort of started rebelling against the
                    nuns, and finding them to be a little too oppressive. But we did have a lot of
                    fun! When you have authorities who are so strict and so clear cut [laughter],
                    you find a lot of ways to be devious, and get around, and do the things you're
                    going to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Which is helpful later on in life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: When there's more than one direct way to get past authority!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely! I mean this is how one learns to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Survive in the government!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. You learn, and </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I run into a lot of Irish Catholics who had the Catholic school experience
                    who learned how to get around authority without being directly rebellious,
                    because you couldn't. You couldn't challenge the nuns directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LOAR: But you'd have to find a way to sort of prevail. I actually have two close
                    friends from grammar school I still am very close to, and we see each other all
                    the time. Our lives have gone many different directions, but we realize just
                    what bonds were forged under the thumb of the nuns. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I also had other teachers. I had a lay teacher in fifth grade who took a
                    great interest in me and who would take me out to restaurants and teach me
                    manners, and then moved to the seventh grade to have me and my other friends as
                    students again. She was a great, great person for me to become confident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Geri Tozer, T-O-Z-E-R, Geraldine Tozer. She moved out to California when I
                    was in college. But she had a great interest in teaching us polish and poise
                    -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Huh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And how to present yourself. She just valued us so much, and gave us so
                    much confidence, my friends and me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always try in these histories, if someone talks about a
                        teacher, to get their name in. If nothing else, a little immortality for?I
                        think it's only fair!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh yes, write it down because I should catch up with her. She was just
                    terrific! She really taught us all what was going on out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that because of Pope John XXIII coming and
                        things were changing, the Catholic Church, particularly the Irish Catholic
                        Church in the United States, was several steps behind almost all the other
                        churches? I mean it was very doctrinaire and all that. Did you notice
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, not in grammar school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course not, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LOAR: I just didn't like the authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The oppressive authority. In high school, I went to Saint Mary's High
                    School in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. It was actually in a converted cigar factory.
                    It has shut down since then because it was in kind of a tough neighborhood. They
                    opened up other Catholic schools in more suburban neighborhoods so that kids
                    could go to them. That was a school where I really think I got a great
                    education. I learned Latin. I had some really terrific English teachers, and
                    that became my interest - literature. We had an incredibly fun social life. Ah,
                    [laughter] we just had a great time. It was about 70 percent girls and only
                    about 30 percent boys because there was a really good boy's school not far away.
                    The real good boy athletes would go there, so a lot of us girls were in student
                    government. It was a different kind of environment. But yes, then we polished
                    and refined our ways to get what we wanted to get done [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about things like movies and reading and things like
                        that? I mean were they telling you, “Don't see this.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, of course. My parents followed the Catholic newspaper. It had a rating
                    on all the movies, and we couldn't go to a movie that the Catholic newspaper
                    thought would be objectionable, and we'd follow that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, we did [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ... probably until I was in my junior or senior year of high school, when I
                    started dating guys and had broader horizons. But we were extremely sheltered in
                    a lot of ways. With my own kids now, I wish they could be sheltered a bit more
                    than they are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh well, things are so different now too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Authority was annoying and obviously difficult; but there was also a
                    sense that it did prepare you, I think, down the road for big government,
                    because there was the confines of what to do, and then ways to survive in that,
                    and to excel in it, and to make it work for you. But, the whole thing was, 'You
                    do good' — and that's not a bad message — 'and that you were here to serve, and
                    you're here for others, and you don't put yourself first.'</p>
                <p>I remember the assistant principal of the school in eighth grade. I was leading
                    some third grade project, and I came in. I told her what I did. I said, “Me and
                    my friend Mira Mitchell, we just finished up the training for the holy communion
                    kids, for second grade.” And she looked at me and said, “What!” And I said,
                    “Well, me and Mira Mitchell - “ She said, “You NEVER, EVER put yourself first!”
                    And it was like, I'm remembering eighth grade because I put myself first, and
                    you never, ever do that. Now, that can be a handicap when you get out in life,
                    but it is something that's part of the training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, that's right. But in grammar school and in high
                        school were there any courses that you particularly cottoned on to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Literature. I loved literature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Literature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: In grammar school I just hated math.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I'm very bad at math.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But I loved literature, and I loved arts. I had a hard time with math. I
                    fooled around in the language classes in high school, so I did nothing
                    [laughter]. But in Latin I learned a lot because I had a very wonderful Sister
                    Myriad. What a terrific teacher. We had quizzes every day, and I loved that! And
                    religion was ridiculous because they didn't present it very well; but I do know
                    every saint in the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't this about the time when they were wiping the saints
                        out, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I was named Saint Theresa. A lot of the nuns liked us named after
                    Saint Theresa of Lisieux, the little flower. So nuns would give me gifts on my
                    feast day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I was quite lucky. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I actually had to get little statues and holy cards, and it was very nice.
                    I felt very lucky. I was actually born on my older brother Daniel's birthday so
                    he got to select my name. He picked my name from a statue in some room, Saint
                    Theresa. It could have been worse!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So I felt very lucky to have that name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, like people named Philomena, I believe -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that she was wiped out, I think, during the
                        Reform.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Wiped off the counter. Yes, but we knew our saints and our saint days and
                    we knew the stories of the saints, which you know, as you get older, you read a
                    little differently. But there are some wonderful role models -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, sure, sure!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: People who'd used their lives for ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not a Catholic, although my name is Kennedy.</hi>

                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I always think of Saint Barbara somehow as the Saint
                        of Artillery.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not quite sure why [laughter].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I think she was a doctor of the church as well. I think she was a
                    scholar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any books that stick out in your mind in high

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I loved reading all the Nancy Drew Mysteries. I thought they were
                    very exciting; I would read the Hardy Boys because I thought they had bigger
                    vocabularies. So my sister and I would be reading Hardy Boys, and one of us
                    would use a big word. We would say, [nasal tone of voice] “You're reading the
                    Hardy Boys. That's where you got that word!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But I loved reading about Amelia Earhart and Nellie Bly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?and people I thought were great heroes for doing courageous things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you finding yourself identifying with female
                        role models at the time, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: You know, I guess I haven't thought about that very much, but I did think
                    it would be exciting to travel around the world and do exciting, independent
                    things. The name of the book was Nellie Bly, Girl Reporter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and I -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I remember reading that and thinking, that it was that great I loved to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>LOAR: I didn't know that reading and being a journalist were not the same thing.
                    But I thought I would be a writer or something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She went around the world or something, didn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She did. The picture was her in an airplane, so she must have done quite a
                    bit of international journalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But I liked Amelia Earhart; I thought that was an incredible story, just
                    breaking new ground and trying exciting, new things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I also liked Joan of Arc.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I haven't thought about that before, but I loved reading about Joan of
                    Arc and what she did. Actually, we saw an old movie about Joan of Arc about
                    three or four years ago. My son saw it with us and he was about 10 at the time.
                    He said, “She was a real go-getter, wasn't she!” [Laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I loved to read literature and I just loved having a lot of fun in high

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I was wondering. This is not an interview concentrated

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>LOAR: Lib.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you have the feeling from the church and the
                        teaching that your place was in the home, or was it all expansive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Nah, I didn't listen to that. It never occurred to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I don't think my mother ever expected that either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: My mother didn't get to go to college. Her sister, who was an “Auntie Mame”
                    type character who traveled around the world all the time, did. She was a
                    schoolteacher in New York, and she traveled every summer. So we always knew
                    about her travels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So we knew there was a big world out there. Because my mother's brothers
                    were educated — both of them had gone to college and to law school — I think she
                    thought that was good to do. And, I think she sort of expected that whoever of
                    us could, would do that. I don't think the idethat her place was in the home —
                    applied to me. I always thought I'd have a wonderful family, which I'm lucky I
                    do. But I thought I'd go out, and do exciting things, and travel, and see the
                    world, and help people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by the time you were moving up, you were moving into
                        the late '60s. Did the Vietnam protests and all that, or Vietnam itself
                        intrude at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it really affected my older siblings more than me. They sort of set
                    the tone. We listened to Jimi Hendrix (James Marshall Hendrix), and I knew all
                    about the best music at a very young age because I had these older siblings. I
                    think it did open up a lot of things, and I think it obviously opened up a lot
                    of the ways our society looked at things and looked at government and looked at
                    our place in the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>But it didn't affect my life per se. My sister went to Woodstock, and that was a
                    great problem in our family because she stayed away for a couple days. My
                    parents were up late and I remember being on the phone trying to find out where
                    she was. I remember noticing there was a lot of tension between my older
                    siblings and my parents. But my mother just trusted us. She didn't have the
                    point of view that you have to do this or you have to do that. You have to be a
                    good Catholic, and you have to be a good person. That was the big guidance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in high school, were you involved in

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I was in student government. I was junior class vice president and
                    senior class president. It was a lot of fun. We had a good group, and we did
                    activities. Geraldo Rivera did a big expos�. He was a really good journalist
                    when he started out - at least I thought so as a teenager.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He later became sort of a sensationalist -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes?a bit flaky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A bit flaky, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: He's come back. He did a good thing on human trafficking recently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So, I actually think he's coming back to his roots. But he did an expos� of
                    a school in a home for retarded people called Willowbrook, [State School] in
                    Staten Island, New Jersey [New York], on the news, and everybody was shocked by
                    it. So we did a clothing drive for the students at Willowbrook, and I remember
                    giving a public address announcement to the school to encourage people to bring
                    in clothing and to do things.</p>
                <p>We also baked cookies for the inmates at Rahway State Prison, and, shortly
                    afterwards, there was a riot [laughter]! To this day I get teased that their
                    chant was “no more cookies from Saint Mary's or from Theresa.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But you know, we did a lot of social good stuff in the community.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's great. What about the troubles in Northern
                        Ireland? Coming from an Irish family, did that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It didn't. I do think I was very fortunate growing up. My father, since he
                    worked in the post office, worked with people of all different faiths and races.
                    And my father really made a point of teaching us that while we didn't go to
                    school with black people everyone was equal. We lived in a neighborhood that was
                    Irish, a little Italian, a lot of Polish, and that was my universe. Even in high
                    school there were few people of color, but not many - some Puerto Rican and
                    Hispanic kids from near my high school. I really didn't have any exposure to
                    black people, so I felt very fortunate that my father had a very strong point of
                    view, and that no one could ever make any remarks. As far as religions, we had
                    neighbors who were Jewish, and my father would have ecumenical services with
                    them. That was very fortunate. However, there was one group that we thought were
                    the lowest in God's creation, and that's the English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So I grew up with a very odd bias against the English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And that came from my mother's real sensibility from her parents of what
                    they had suffered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So we just knew that, and I didn't really know the specifics of it until
                    later in my professional career when I became very involved. I'm still very
                    close to what's going on in Northern Ireland, and have very close contacts
                    there. One of the most wonderful things I got to do in my career was to be
                    involved in Northern Ireland right after the Good Friday Peace Agreement and to
                    be able to build some programs there that helped the women find their voice in
                    the political process.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't part of my growing up. It's just that we knew all the Irish songs.
                    I had an Uncle Jimmy Payton who taught us all the lyrics to “Danny Boy” — the
                    first and the second lyrics. My father had a beautiful singing voice.</p>

                        or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter] It probably was, you know, “I'll Take You Home Again
                    Kathleen.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And all the protest songs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And that was a part of the sensibility. But those I've learned are really
                    Irish immigrant songs. The sensibility and the feelings of the Irish immigrant,
                    the children, and grandchildren of the Irish immigrants is what forms those
                    songs - what that experience was like, and the longing to go back, and the
                    feelings against the British - which are really very out of date to what's
                    actually going on now in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. While you were in high school, did the outside world
                        or the UN (United Nations) intrude in teaching international relations or
                        anything of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No, I wasn't really aware of the UN. I didn't know anybody who did anything
                    related to that. We would have drills and hide under our desks against the
                    Russians. My mother would store food in the basement, and I was sure that was
                    because the Russians were going to come, and all nine of us would have to live
                    in the cellar.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But [laughter] there wasn't a sense of the U.S. and the rest of the world.
                    I remember when John Kennedy was shot. And I was, I guess, in fourth or fifth
                    grade and the whole school was crying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would have been about nine years old then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So about fourth or fifth grade, yes. And we were all crying, and we all got
                    on our knees to say the rosary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the election of Kennedy, was there sort of the feeling

                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I didn't feel that there was any Catholic prejudice because I lived in a
                    Catholic world. My father would say, “Newspapers aren't reporting correctly on
                    things.” He would have this feeling that there was anti-Catholic prejudice
                    sometimes; but I never experienced it, I have to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And my world was Catholic, you know!</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I did. I was a candy striper in high school and met a boy who wasn't
                    Catholic. And that was a hard thing for my mother. [Laughter] Of course he had a
                    Corvette, and that was doubly hard -</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And he was rich! [Laughter]Error! Bookmark not defined. So there were
                    several grounds for suspicion. I guess he was a year older or so. He was a
                    doctor's son. That didn't last long. He was kind of a jerk, so it was my
                    choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: My mother just sort of questioned, “So what's the deal here?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. I'm of an older generation. I was born in '28,
                        and I belonged to a Protestant thing. So, well, Catholic girls were nice,
                        but if you married them, the children will have to be brought up in the
                        Catholic religion. I'm not quite sure why this is so terrible, but it was
                        something that hung out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These prejudices today are so kind of beyond. My son is
                        married to a young - well, not so young - lady named Theresa, and they've
                        got two kids; and we wish them well in whatever religion they're brought up
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. We had good feelings towards other religions. You know, it was a sin
                    to walk into a church that wasn't a Catholic church, and it was almost as bad a
                    sin not to pay a visit when you walked past a church. So you'd have to run and
                    say hello, then you'd kneel down, cross yourself [laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But yes, I did meet some other guys; but it was high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Well then, you graduated from high school
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Seventy-two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither? You say your family had prepared you to go on;
                        the idea was you would go on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it wasn't that you had to, but it was certainly possible. And, it was
                    self-financed if you could pull it together, and I always thought I could. There
                    were four older siblings. My oldest sister went to art school; she was, in fact
                    is, a very talented artist. My brother, the one who named me, graduated from
                    Rutgers College in New Jersey on a scholarship; I'm very proud of him; he got
                    his master's. Then, my other sister went to nursing school. And my other sister,
                    who's an artist and singer-songwriter and very talented, went to many different
                    colleges and bounced around in music and theater programs. You found where you
                    wanted to go to school; it was the guidance counselors who gave you ideas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And the guidance counselors only knew of Catholic schools.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter] The rest of them were sort of like pagan schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But I looked at different colleges. My sister was going to the University
                    of Dayton, which was a Catholic school. I don't know what order it's affiliated
                    with. I went to visit her with another friend. We went down to the University of
                    Louisville in Kentucky. I thought that sounded cool and I went in and talked
                    with them. I applied; and they said yes. When I applied I had no idea where I
                    was applying. I didn't know anything about schools; but Louisville came back and
                    said they'd give me money, and that sounded good. At this time, I had met
                    somebody whom I was madly in love with and he was going to go to law school at
                    the time. So far, it's turned out pretty well. He's been my husband for 25
                    years, so!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I met him in my senior year of high school, which is an unusual time to
                    meet your mate for life, but I feel lucky in that, too. So he decided to go to
                    law school in Louisville, and I went to undergraduate school. I worked in the
                    summer. We all worked as soon as we'd get our working papers, because that meant
                    you had spending money. But girls were able to do babysitting. My mother would
                    sometimes answer the phone, “Loar's Babysitting Services” because we were five
                    girls and we all babysat and that was really great! We would iron shirts and
                    work in a supermarket. That was allowed. That was another great high school
                    experience [laughter] - working in the supermarket! And that was a broader
                    social set too, because I met the boys from the Catholic high school! That's
                    broad, you know! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Another high school! [Laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's another high school!</hi>

                <p>LOAR: And actually some kids from the public schools; they were a little wilder.
                    The summer before college, I made a lot of money. My
                    then-boyfriend/current-husband and I painted house numbers on curbs. We charged
                    a dollar a house and made $1,000. I paid my tuition. It was really great. We
                    just bought black and white spray paint, stencils, and went around knocking
                    door-to-door. I was too shy to do that, so he did more of the selling: “It's
                    only a dollar, blah, blah, blah,” and I would smile nicely [laughter], and we
                    would just spray the curbs. We'd just go around from one neighborhood to
                    another. [We] made a lot of money doing this. We would swim during the days
                    finding places where we could use the pool and make that money. So I ran off
                    with that money in my pocket and some offers of financial aid.</p>

                <p>LOAR: His name is Richard Bonsignore, B as in boy-O-N-S-I-G-N-O-R-E, like
                    monsignore, only Bonsignore. He comes from a wonderful, Italian American
                    Sicilian family. As my father-in-law used to say, there's two kinds of Italians
                    - Sicilians and those who wish they were. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I met his family when I was 17 years old and came into his family, a
                    wonderful, loving family - mother, father, brother, and sister. He was the only
                    one of his family who had a chance to go to college. His father had done a lot
                    of different things; but, at the time my husband was in college, his father had
                    a trucking business. So his father paid for his college and gave him a
                    convertible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: He really lived the high life. [Laughter] He was thinking about going to
                    law school, so we decided to go to law school and college together. That was a
                    little bit of a concern to my mother, as you might imagine, because I was, 18 at
                    that time. She did want me to go to college because she thought I should as I
                    had done well in school and liked school. She was concerned that I wouldn't if I
                    ran off with this guy. But she liked him and my family liked him. They thought
                    he was a little old because he was six years older, which is old when you look
                    at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It doesn't make any difference later on in life, but it mattered then. He
                    was the same age as my older brother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So that was a concern. But he hung around and hung around, and we got to
                    know his family, and his family got to know my family. One day my Uncle John
                    McCabe, who was my mother's younger brother and who didn't have the full
                    responsibility of taking care of the family when his parents died (he was sort
                    of the younger fella who got a chance to live life and had a lot of fun, and
                    he's a very fun-loving guy still) was visiting, and Richard was over, and this
                    issue of my going to college in Kentucky and Richard going to law school there
                    came up.</p>
                <p>My mother's position was: “I don't know if that's such a good idea, you're going
                    off with this guy. You shouldn't, you know.” It wasn't going to be a
                    confrontation, but there was some concern. But I had good financial aid, and I
                    had the cash, and I was in madly in love, and the school had an English
                    department and that's what I was interested in.</p>
                <p>My uncle pulled my mother aside and said, “You should be thinking differently.
                    You should be thinking like a Jewish mother. You want your daughter to marry
                    this guy. He's going to law school. You want her to go off with him and then get
                    a life together.” And he talked to my mother and calmed her down about it a
                    little bit. But we gave him a lot of credit for imagining us being able to get
                    married ultimately.</p>
                <p>So we went off to school together. He was in law school, and a very serious law
                    student. I was undergraduate and a very serious undergraduate. I had a little
                    different undergraduate experience than some people in that I hung around with
                    law students and all they did was study. So I really hit the books hard and it
                    was fabulous. While I had a lot of fun in high school with emphasis on my social
                    life, in college I really got into the academics and loved it, just absolutely
                    loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Louisville, the college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No, the University of Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: University of Louisville in Kentucky. It was Catholic, I
                        assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>LOAR: Not at all, actually! Not at all, and that was, you know, probably another
                    little concern for my mother - that it was a public school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public school, huh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's a school that draws a lot from Louisville and a lot from Kentucky, and
                    I really have no idea how I ended up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they're always looking for somebody from outside to
                        give it a broader -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, it was a big culture shock. It was like going to another country, in
                    that everybody spoke with an accent that wasn't a New Jersey or New York
                    accent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There were people from rural Kentucky who kept firearms in their rooms; and
                    there were people from coal mining families. It was a very different
                    environment. But really, it was hard to understand people, and they thought I
                    talked too fast. But I just loved the academics on the campus, and I loved
                    Louisville. It was so pretty. They had old Victorian houses, and it was along
                    the river. I just felt like I could do really well. I just remember loving,
                    loving my English literature courses, and music history, and art history, and
                    French — though I'm not very good at languages, to put it mildly. I studied
                    French and French literature a lot, and did very well. I was on the dean's lists
                    and loved it. I read a lot and enjoyed being in class with people who loved the
                    same things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Kentucky doesn't sound like the heartland of
                        intellectual endeavor or something like that. But please correct me, how did
                        you find that all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, you know, I didn't have that sensibility. I had a lot of excellent
                    professors! I had one English professor who would always encourage me when I
                    wrote poetry, and when I would took these honors classes. I took one with her
                    on, I think, Virginia Woolf and that got me very interested in a lot of writers
                    and women writers.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>This one professor, Sena Jeter Naslund, was a writer at the same time. She has
                    since become a very famous writer. I actually was listening to NPR (National
                    Public Radio) about five or six months ago, and I heard her voice on the radio.
                    She's not from Kentucky; I don't know where she's from. She wrote a book called
                    Ahab's Wife, which is an incredible book! And I heard her speaking, and I
                    thought, “I wonder if that - it must be - is that Professor Naslund?” Since
                    then, I've read her book. I still need to get in touch with her and to contact
                    her, because she was a great professor. She really encouraged me; she inspired
                    me. She was brilliant; and she just had such insights into literature, and
                    writing, and the human experience.</p>
                <p>I had a great music history professor who helped me understand all the great
                    composers and what they were trying to do with music.</p>
                <p>In French art history, I had Professor Fink, who taught me all about the
                    cathedrals. So I knew every cathedral in France, and how to read the doors and
                    the carvings. I was really, really into French history and architecture.</p>
                <p>You know, I had no idea about schools, and reputations, and what they did, or
                    anything else. I just knew that I was really learning lots and lots of things. I
                    also had three jobs. I was a resident assistant in a dormitory, which was a
                    great cultural experience, because I would have students who would think it was
                    a good idea to listen to their stereos in the middle of the night. They would
                    turn their stereos on in their room, and then walk down the hall to take
                    showers. They would turn the stereo on so they could hear the stereo while they
                    were in the shower.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, good [Laughter]!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And of course, they weren't really taking classes. They were just kind of
                    hanging out in the dorm. So that became a little challenging.</p>
                <p>I worked as a waitress in a restaurant called the Finish Line, so I got a great
                    Kentucky pie recipe from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A nice little benefit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?Lifelong [laughter]?which meant a great value to me. I worked in the art
                    library and music library, but loved it! I mean I just loved -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you beginning to feel the cultural change in running
                        a dorm where guys and girls were mixing up? Was this happening at that
                        point, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, but my social group was only some of the people from my dorm but a lot
                    of my boyfriend/husband's fellow law students. I hung out with an older group -
                    the law students; and I loved it! I really enjoyed that. But it was an
                    incredible cultural experience to become very close friends with people who grew
                    up in Appalachia, who had a really rural experience. They thought New Jersey
                    looked like the middle of the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And it was a really rich and interesting time. Because I guess I was decent
                    in French, or maybe even good in French, in college, the school had a program in
                    my junior year summer where you could go overseas; it was a work-exchange
                    program. The cities of Louisville, Kentucky and Montpellier in southern France
                    were sister cities.</p>
                <p>I wanted to go to France because I knew every cathedral and was dying to see
                    them. So I applied for it and went over in the summer of my junior year to
                    Montpellier. I had a host family. But, by some fluke, I had three or four host
                    families. I was staying in the dormitory at the university and working. I was
                    supposed to work in the library, but they kind of said, “Oh, it's the
                    summertime, and you're a young person. You don't want to work.” So I didn't have
                    to work. They would take me sailing and to their country homes. My other friends
                    had to work in the emergency room in a hospital. [Laughter] They had really
                    demanding jobs, and I was always sightseeing and hanging out with everybody's
                    family; and it was an incredible experience. But meanwhile that paid. They gave
                    me a stipend, and they paid for my housing right there. So all I had to come up
                    with was the airfare. That was an incredible experience! My boyfriend/husband
                    came over to meet me. He had just taken the bar exam, and we met in Paris and
                    traveled around together. It was my first international trip, and it was just
                    totally fabulous!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were getting, obviously, this French and the
                        cathedrals, but how about international relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I had no interest in that in college. None. I wasn't interested in
                    political science. I wasn't interested in history because I thought history was
                    boring. I loved history for the literature. I loved learning about a period -
                    you know, French Revolution, or American Civil War - through literature. That's
                    how I wanted to learn history. I avoided economics. I took survey courses if I
                    had to. But I was really interested in international stuff, primarily because I
                    wanted to see the art, and experience the culture, and speak the language. That
                    was my interest in being overseas at that point. It was very much on the
                    artistic and cultural side of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in literature? Did the literature of the, I
                        suppose it was the Beat Generation, did that strike a responsive chord? Or
                        were you aiming at things that were not particularly generationally

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I didn't find that particularly compelling. I loved the romantic poets,
                    Charles Dickens, Emily Dickinson, and Mark Twain. I loved the American writers.
                    I really didn't plug into the current stuff; it didn't really speak to me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. I did love writers like Virginia Woolf, who had a focus, an
                    experience, and a life, and a writing that focused to some degree on a woman's
                    experience and I really was drawn to that, and loved that, and read everything I
                    could. I did enjoy reading a lot of the women writers, but I wouldn't say that I
                    focused on that.</p>

                        you were planning to get married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I guess so. I have to say I never thought, “Oh, I'm definitely marrying
                    this guy.” I just knew that this was somebody I really loved and loved being
                    with. I didn't know where I would head. I just didn't have that. I just loved
                    really doing well. Every time I got on the dean's list, I'd go into the
                    financial aid office and they'd give me more grants and fewer loans. And that
                    was great, because I was very worried about having loans when I graduated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: When I graduated, I had $3,000 in loans. I was in a panic because I
                    thought, “I have to pay this up.” Actually, I didn't want to get married until I
                    paid them off because I didn't want to go into the relationship with debts! But,
                    I thought I would be an English professor or I'd work in publishing, or I really
                    didn't know what I would do. But I loved the studying of it, and the experience
                    of it, and all that.</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, in my junior year summer (since I had gone to France and I sort of
                    used my money to pay for that air travel), when Richard from graduated law
                    school and passed the bar exam, we decided we had to make a choice: to stay in
                    Louisville for another year or to transfer to New Jersey. And you know, we had a
                    chance to build a little law firm with someone from his hometown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was from New Jersey then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: He was from New Jersey, too. He was from a town about 40 minutes away from
                    me called Raritan, New Jersey. A very Italian American community [laughter].</p>
                <p>He had a chance, when he graduated, to go into a small law partnership with
                    someone from the town of Somerville, New Jersey. So I had to decide whether I
                    wanted to stay in Louisville and he would stay and work there, or whether I
                    wanted to transfer to someplace in New Jersey. I loved the school, but it wasn't
                    like I was itchy, and I didn't feel like, “Oh, I have to finish up here.” And, I
                    had had this chance to go to France, and I knew if I spent my money paying for
                    the airfare, I wouldn't be able to afford another year at Louisville.</p>
                <p>So I applied to Rutgers College in New Brunswick, which was about a half hour
                    away from my parent's house, and I got accepted. They took all my credits, and
                    they gave me a $500 state scholarship, and so at that point, it cost me nothing
                    to go to school. But my father at this point was in a position to contribute and
                    he offered. It was very sweet and kind of him to offer it, and to have me keep
                    the $500. That was very nice. So I had a chance to go to school for free and
                    live at home, which was an interesting experience after you've been out. My
                    husband had passed the bar and was starting to set up his practice. I went
                    through Rutgers in one year, and that was a different kind of impersonal
                    experience, because I was sort of in and out of classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's sort of a big - living at home and -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's a big school. I liked Rutgers. I think the academics and the quality
                    of the classes was great, but I didn't really connect very much. I had a great
                    professor for Shakespeare and all that, but I sort of just went in and out. I
                    was vaguely aware that there was Douglass College, a women's college. I kind of
                    knew they had these sort of marches for Take Back the Night and feminists'
                    issues, but it didn't really appeal to me particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Actually there's an interesting story, considering whom I'm talking to
                    here.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There was a Foreign Service recruiter who came to Rutgers. Now, I don't
                    think Louisville would have attracted a Foreign Service career recruiter, but
                    Rutgers did; and there was actually, I think, a female officer. The recruiter
                    was on campus. I thought, “Well, you know, Uncle Jimmy was in the Foreign
                    Service. Maybe this is what I want to do, and Richard's up for anything.” So I
                    went over to where the person was, and kind of walked by the room, and looked at
                    the person, and kind of walked out. In my mind I said, “No, I don't think I'd
                    ever be qualified.” [Laughter] “I don't think I'd even be suitable to talk to
                    the person!” So I chickened out, and walked away, and didn't talk to the
                    recruiter; but in my mind I guess I'd been thinking ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think your reaction is one that many of us who ended up
                        in the Foreign Service had. I know when I came in, I'd had a good education
                        and all, but I felt this isn't for the likes of me: I don't have family,
                        money. These were pretty fancy people and all that. It's probably lost good
                        candidates just because of this attitude; not because it doesn't pay much
                        money or something. But this is almost in one way or another, either
                        intellectually or financially, too fancy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I thought I wouldn't know anything. I'm an English major. I liked the
                    idea of international travel mainly because I wanted to see those cathedrals!
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>So I went through my senior year. My husband now was setting up his law practice
                    and doing well. He and his partner bought a building, and it was great. We
                    talked about getting married then, I guess, and we did. We got married at
                    Kirkpatrick Chapel at Rutgers. It was a wonderful, fabulous wedding. It was
                    great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before you graduated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No, right after I graduated. I graduated, I guess, in May or June, and we
                    got married in June. You know, we had a wonderful time in college. We would
                    drive out together in 12 hours to Kentucky from New Jersey. Richard's father
                    would make homemade Sicilian pizzas for us to have in the car to carry out with
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it calzone, or whatever it is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No, it was actually pizzas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Real pizza.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>LOAR: It's really, really good! Both of his parents are the best cooks that I
                    have ever met - really, really terrific. He and his brother and sister are also
                    good cooks.</p>
                <p>So we got married there, and then we went for a honeymoon. And so I was like
                    totally panicked because I had this $3,000 debt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right after I graduated I didn't really know anybody who was working in New
                    York; but, I thought I would want to work in New York, because that's what you
                    did if you wanted to have an exciting career. When I was little, I used to read
                    the Apartment 3-G comic strips. Reminds me of another thing about the career
                    girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I thought I'd be one of those career girls from Apartment 3-G.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 3-G, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then I was even working in a big city. Actually my friends and I in
                    grammar school would go into New York City. I'm sure my mother did not know
                    this, because I would not let a grammar school girl do this! We would take the
                    public bus into New York City. We would get shopping bags and pretend they were
                    briefcases. We would walk around, and walk into buildings with our shopping
                    bags, and make people think we had briefcases, and that we worked there
                    [laughter]. So I guess I had on my mind I was going to be a career girl and do
                    something in the big city. And, that's what I ended up doing. As soon as I
                    graduated, I actually went into New York. I thought I wanted to work in public
                    relations or magazines or publishing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is sort of the traditional for young women of
                        literary majors. You just named the whole spectrum of where one looked for
                        this, and it's been a very successful thing for many people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did this work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LOAR: I went into New York, and I thought, “Okay. Who would like me?” So I looked
                    up the magazines I thought I wanted to work at, and there was a magazine, Cue,
                    C-U-E, which at that time was like an entertainment thing. I went to all the
                    different magazines. I would walk in, and they would say, “Well, can you type?
                    What are your skills? Blah, Blah, Blah, and you know.” I then went, and looked
                    at the PR (Public Relations) firms, and picked out the ones with Irish names
                    because I thought, “They're going to look at me. They're going to see I'm one of
                    them. They're going to like me.” I never got to the publishing houses.</p>
                <p>I went into one PR firm called Moynihan. Who knows what I was thinking! I went in
                    with my (you know, literally) little resume [laughter] in my hand and my Rutgers
                    College degree — a graduate in English literature. I was hoping to meet Mr.
                    Moynihan, who ran the company. I had no idea what PR firms were or anything
                    else. While I was waiting and talking to the lady, she said, “Well, just have a
                    seat here.” And then some mailman came in and was really hassling me. I guess
                    you would consider it pretty serious hassling. He was really gross and coming on
                    to me, and the receptionist was really offended by that, and she said, “Go sit
                    in Mr. Moynihan's office. You shouldn't have to put up with this.</p>
                <p>Mr. Moynihan came back, and I'm sitting in his office, and he said, “So, why do
                    you think you should work here?” And I said, “Well, I'm an English major. I can
                    write, and you're Irish, and I'm Irish!” He said, “Well, do you have some typing
                    skills?” And I said, “Well, yes,” totally untrue. I had never learned how to
                    type because I wasn't going to need it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And my husband was a hunt-and-peck typist. He used to type all my papers
                    for me on his little typewriter, so I never learned how to type. I don't know
                    why I thought people cared what I was going to do. But he said, “Well, you seem
                    presentable,” and he was a very kind, very nice, very gentlemanly older man. And
                    he said, “Well, I have a friend who's opening up an office for Phillips Andover
                    Academy.” And I thought, “That's interesting; what the heck is that?” And he
                    said, “They're doing a fund raising campaign.” I said, “No concept for that.”
                    And I guess he said, “Would you like to work there?” “Yes, I would!”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So he sent me over to meet his friend Jack Kates, John Kates, IV, who was
                    an Andover grad and a Yale grad and real blue blood, New York -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Real establishment type.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LOAR: In the social register, and everything else. This fellow asked me about my
                    typing skills and would I take a typing test. I said, “Gee, I'd rather not!” But
                    he insisted, and I had 29 words a minute [laughter]! He said, “Well, you know, I
                    like your manners. I like your Catholic school manners, and we're going to open
                    up an office here for Phillips Andover Academy. They're doing a Bicentennial
                    Capital Fundraising Campaign to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the school.
                    You can come in and be the secretary.” I was like, no?I really don't want to be
                    a secretary. Hey, I'm a college graduate! He said, “Well, you could be the
                    secretary.” So that sounded okay because it sounded like an educational thing,
                    it sounded interesting, and he was going to pay me. So he said, “But you'd have
                    to start in two weeks.” I said, “Well, I'm getting married.” He said, “Well, I'm
                    not going to hold it open for you!” And he said, “Well, do you have to do a
                    honeymoon?” This isn't this guy, and he was a very nice guy, but he clearly was
                    having some pressure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I really, really was pressured with this $3,000 debt, but I did really want
                    to go on my honeymoon. So I kind of took that risk and said, “I'll call you when
                    I get back,” and we went up to New England and then Canada for our honeymoon. On
                    the way back, I stopped at Andover and at the school, Phillips Andover Academy,
                    and went around and met people. I guess that was a good move. I tried to find
                    some presentable clothes to put on. When I came back into New York, Jack Kates
                    hired me, and I started my first job.</p>
                <p>I earned $6,500 a year to be a secretary for this fundraising campaign. It was an
                    incredibly lucky experience because I got exposed to all the board of trustees
                    at Andover. They included George Bush [George Herbert Walker Bush], the father,
                    at the time, and a wonderful man named Tim Ireland, who was a partner in Brown
                    Brothers Banking [Brown Brothers Harriman and Company]. It was all the
                    establishment people who ran publishing firms, and people who ran banks, and who
                    ran the investment banking firms; it was a wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the campus of Andover hit you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was like a college. It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful! I
                    thought, yes, this is presentable. I could make a contribution to this
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>LOAR: And it was actually very, very good because it widened my horizons a great
                    deal. The whole experience of working for an organization like that and an
                    institution like that widened my horizons. I looked at the standards of this
                    place, and at the people who graduate, where they come from and where they go,
                    and at the work that I did with the graduates, some of them my own age. That
                    actually gave me a lot of confidence, because I realized, that while I didn't
                    have some of those benefits of family, education, background and all, I felt I
                    had drive and I had an interest in doing things in life. It was a wonderful,
                    wonderful experience. I did have to take a typing course at night, and it was
                    one of the low points because I had to stay in New York at night to take this
                    typing course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I thought, “It's ridiculous that I have to learn all that typing!”
                    [Laughter] But I did it and I would call Richard's law office. His partner's
                    wife was the secretary there; and I'd ask her, “When you do a letter, where do
                    you put the salutation and the date?” I was really bad! I didn't know anything,
                    but I learned what to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, how long did you do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I did this for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be really '76 to '80, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Seventy-six to eighty. And we were located in the S&amp;H Green Stamp
                    building because the Beinecke family, who were a very prominent family at
                    Andover and Yale - there's a Beinecke Rare Book [and Manuscript] Library now -
                    donated the space to us.</p>
                <p>After about six months in that office, we hired someone who actually did have
                    secretarial skills and I became staff assistant, which meant that somebody who
                    knew how to do things of a secretarial nature was able to do that. I would do
                    things like research what the Major Gifts Committee should do, and I focused a
                    lot on the development of the major gifts - gifts of [$] 100,000 and over. We
                    would put together research files on how to go after a particular family who had
                    donated this, and profiled one they might be interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were being paid to find out what made the Eastern
                        establishment tick, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LOAR: I know [laughter]. It was fascinating to see the hereditary genes in the
                    families, and it was just such an eye-opener to me that people lived this way in
                    great polish. I would actually go to these meetings at the Major Gifts
                    Committee, they would be at the University Club in New York, a beautiful
                    Stanford White building.</p>
                <p>When I got married I kept my maiden name. So I did have this sense that I'm an
                    independent woman. I didn't want to take - I loved the name Bonsignore, but you
                    know, I'm not an Italian girl. I can't cook, you know! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I hear you. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I shouldn't be called that. I should be Loar because that's an independent
                    thing. My parents never cared. Actually, Richard's family did not care at all.
                    My mother was concerned that people would think we were living in sin and that I
                    wasn't really married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, what does “Loar” mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's a name that goes back. It's some derivation of an Irish name because
                    my mother's mother is from Ireland of Irish ancestry; and we're not sure if it's
                    German or Irish or Welsh, or something. We're still trying to figure it out.
                    There aren't that many Loars in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There really aren't. I know “Kennedy” is sort of Scotch
                        Irish. It means ugly head if you go right back in history [laughter] as the
                        early Kennedys were not the most beautiful people in the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter] That's funny. I don't know what the word “Loar” means, but it
                    does have some Irish Welsh background to it probably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to these meetings, and all this. What was
                        your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was all guys, and it was all very distinguished, highly
                    successful, usually very wealthy men, a lot older than me; so they were probably
                    50s to 60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>LOAR: And I was 22. I remember once walking into the University Club and walking
                    to the elevator, and a nice man in a little uniform came up to me and said,
                    “Who's escorting you?” I said, “Well, I'm going to the Andover meeting on the
                    third floor.” He said, “Well, you cannot walk alone in the University Club.” And
                    I said, “Well, I'm not breaking anything. What's the deal?” He said, “Women do
                    not walk unaccompanied at the University Club.” And I thought it was appalling,
                    and I was so offended [laughter]! I also was embarrassed because I'd felt like
                    what a black person must have felt...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh, yes. Sure, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?walking onto certain golf courses and into certain restaurants. And I
                    really was offended and hurt, and felt bad in embarrassing somebody else. But, I
                    learned to make sure I had somebody escort me.</p>
                <p>So I would go to these meetings, and they would all have salmon. I never had
                    salmon before and they'd hand me this. It was just so fabulous! It was such an
                    eye opener for me! There was the guy who was head of Scientific American, and
                    others — all of these, interesting, fascinating people, and my job was to assist
                    them. There was a senior person with me, obviously, in the office, who had that
                    responsibility. I had to make sure they had their files, and they went after the
                    person they had to go after, and that they had the information they needed. I
                    kept track of when was the last time we asked them, and how much they gave, and
                    blah, blah, blah. It was just like a finishing, polishing thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: These people were so kind and courteous to me, and treated me with so much
                    respect, as if I wasn't 22 years old and didn't know anything. It was just a
                    wonderful, door opening experience!</p>
                <p>I was commuting in from New Jersey. It took me an hour and a half every day to
                    commute and to walk across 42nd Street, because I was making nothing. My husband
                    was doing fine in his law firm, and I needed career clothes, and I, of course,
                    didn't have any money for career clothes because I wasn't making anything, but
                    my husband was doing fine, so I was able to get some clothes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do on your $3,000?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I knocked it off as soon as I could. It just worried me, you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were brought up in that school of thought: you don't
                        have debt hanging over you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, and I also was so afraid of going into a marriage and not being able
                    to support myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I didn't want to be dependent, relying on my husband. I wanted to make sure
                    I could stand on my own two feet and have financial independence. That was
                    extremely important to me: to be able to take care of myself financially.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the international world intrude at all at this

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Only in that my husband and I did some more overseas trips. [Laughter] I
                    had to see more cathedrals and visit more chateaux. During this time they had
                    cheap airfares to London, so we took a trip over to London, and we studied
                    everything, and knew all the little towns and the history of everything. We went
                    to Italy and traveled internationally for the sole purpose of really soaking up
                    the culture and experiencing what the culture was like and the history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your husband have the same interests that you did on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No! He loved the international stuff and he was interested in the culture
                    as well. But he always was interested in politics; he was a political science
                    major in college. He was interested in politics, international affairs to some
                    degree, but really in political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his law business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was a general practice in town. They did extremely well. The partner was
                    older and had been more established in the town. They bought a building, set up
                    their practice, and did very well. It was nice because we didn't worry about
                    money.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: A lot, yes. I felt like a big career girl because a career woman now is
                    independently flying, and they were paying for me to fly up to Andover.</p>
                <p>

                <p>LOAR: Yes. No, it's beautiful. Ted Sizer [Dr. Theodore R. Sizer] was the
                    headmaster, a great person, lovely, a real innovator in education. He had moved
                    to make this school coed when he came on board. He's a great person. And it was
                    the quality people I worked with, and that was really fabulous. And I did have a
                    sense of what was going on - not that I wanted to work in this area. But I
                    remember [Alexander] Solzhenitsyn. Was Gerald Ford the president? I think Gerald
                    Ford was president.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Okay. Well, I remember being embarrassed and thinking that Ford wouldn't
                    meet with Solzhenitsyn and I was embarrassed because Solzhenitsyn was such a
                    great man.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I would remember when I walked past the UN, that in college I had hoped
                    to work at the UN because I thought I was good in languages. Because I got good
                    grades as I was studying so hard, I thought I was good in languages. I wasn't!
                    [Laughter] I was just getting good grades! So I thought when I was in college
                    that I would be a translator or interpreter at the UN. That was one of the
                    things I had hoped to be.</p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I walked past the UN. There were these protests about what was going on in
                    Northern Ireland. I actually remember watching that and actually marched in a
                    protest once, and I was like, “Do I know what I'm doing?” But I do know I care
                    about this!</p>

                    and I, now at this point, had moved into New York. We moved into the city. He
                    left his practice and took a job with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as
                    a lawyer. We got a really great deal on a fabulous apartment. He became very
                    active in that he started his work and career which he does now, in real estate
                    and property law.</p>

                <p>LOAR: There was a family from Sri Lanka, Fauna Rahjah Singum. He worked at the
                    UN, and his family was moving to New York. We volunteered to be their host
                    family. This was a way of getting to know people from other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Actually when I think back, I'm going to back up a little bit to when I was
                    at Rutgers. When Richard and I became friends with some of the foreign students
                    there. We became very interested in what was going on in their lives. There was
                    a guy from Lebanon who had incredible stories to tell on what was going on in
                    Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, because the civil war at that time was going
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right! So I was, I guess, paying attention to more than just the culture of
                    other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I guess I was interested in knowing what people's lives were like, and what
                    they were doing, and had some interest in what our government was doing.</p>

                <p>I remember when we were in Louisville, and my husband was in law school, and I
                    was in undergraduate school. It was all during the Watergate time, and that was
                    the main thing that we talked about all the time. That was the overwhelming
                    issue of discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Because, I mean, I'm hanging around law students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes! Oh God, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Our very close friend, a great guy named Bob Jase, was a die-hard
                    Republican. He was from Massachusetts. He's since passed away. Bob Jase was a
                    die-hard Republican, and Richard and I were big Democrats, and we'd have a lot
                    of discussions about Watergate. So that was a big topic of discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we are talking about this period when you were
                        there, how did you all feel about the Carter administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I liked Jimmy Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Human rights came onto the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I liked Jimmy Carter. I don't remember thinking that much about the human
                    rights issue. I didn't know it was new. I was interested in it, but I don't
                    remember thinking that it was a unique thing or something different that he was
                    doing. I know my dad liked Jimmy Carter a lot, thought he was honest and a good
                    man. I thought that was good, and you know voted Democrat the first time I could
                    vote. I remember in general just thinking Jimmy Carter was a smart guy and a
                    principled person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You tapped into sort of Ms. Gloria Steinem and that sort
                        of thing. Was this at all a theme that you were looking at, or was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. No, I considered myself to be very sort of feminist, in that I wanted
                    to keep my own name when I got married. I wanted to be financially independent;
                    and wanted to make sure that I worked, and had a career, and was able to support
                    myself; and to be my own person, have my own identity, and those kinds of
                    things. But there were parts of it I found less attractive and less
                    interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I would go to these seminars. I remember there was a seminar when I first
                    started working for Andover in '76 or something like '77, about the career of
                    women; some brand new idea. There were all these panels about how to move ahead,
                    how to get a mentor to help you, how to balance work and family. I was very
                    interested in that because I knew I wanted children; but I wanted to make sure I
                    could work, and support myself, and have a career. I went to that one, and there
                    were only three people! Nobody else seemed to care about that! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>At the time I was working for Andover, I was still looking at the publishing
                    houses and thinking that's really what I want to do when this is over. So I
                    would really pay attention to prominent women in publishing. There was a woman
                    named Somebody Evans, Joanie Evans [Joan Evans], who I would follow by reading
                    the newspapers you see what she was doing, and trying to see if there were any
                    women doing well there, who, if I went and talked to them, would want to give me
                    a job [laughter]. So I was really kind of still looking at publishing and seeing
                    if there were women who had succeeded there and if there was something I could
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, what about children? I mean a good, Catholic
                        family, and there you are, you're working, and what -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I wanted to make sure I could support myself, and my family, and my
                    children before - I mean that sounds pretty extreme! But, I came from a
                    wonderful, large family, but there would be no financial support for me from my
                    own family if something happened to my marriage and I had kids. So I wanted to
                    make sure if I had kids that I could actually support them myself.</p>
                <p>I have a great relationship with my husband. I had no doubts about that, but I
                    was afraid. I saw some of my friends from high school who got married and had
                    kids really early and it didn't work out, and they were living with their
                    parents in Iselin, New Jersey. They couldn't support themselves and had no way
                    to, as they didn't have their own income or their own ability to work and have a
                    career. So I really wanted to wait until I was successful enough in my career
                    that I could support myself, support my children, and be able to come back to
                    it, and continue to work, and to be able to keep moving ahead in my life, and
                    achieving things, and having titles and things that would indicate that I was
                    successful! That was very important at that time, you know.</p>
                <p>But we loved living in the city, and we were very close to our families. We saw
                    our families very frequently, going out to New Jersey and back to visit
                    everybody. I'm very close to some of my siblings, and my husband helped my
                    brother get a job at his company. We felt very close to our family.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 20 August 2001. Theresa, 1980 after Andover,
                        whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The Andover campaign was a four-year campaign with a set goal, and once we
                    reached that goal on the Major Gifts Committee — we passed it — then the team
                    sort of broke up, and everybody scattered.</p>
                <p>I had the opportunity, having worked with all these wonderful Andover trustees
                    and folks who were involved in fundraising for major gifts, to meet a lot of
                    wonderful, supportive, older men who were interested in seeing what kind of jobs
                    I might be interested in. One in particular, a man named Tim Ireland, from a
                    long distinguished Andover family, R.L. Ireland III was his name, was just so
                    kind. He brought me down to Wall Street to meet with people at Brown Brothers
                    Harriman [and Company], a private banking firm where he was a partner. He had me
                    meet with Morgan Stanley investment bankers, and with people at publishing
                    firms, and magazines.</p>
                <p>And then I met with people in an advertising agency, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample;. I
                    clicked there, loved those folks, and thought I would love working there. He
                    said, “Okay. I'm going to help you get this job!” He was great friends with the
                    Fitzgerald of Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, though I think Fitzgerald was long
                    retired. He just kind of stayed after the personnel director to hire me. Of
                    course the advertising agency didn't want to hire me because I didn't have an
                    MBA (Master of Business Administration). I had nothing to recommend myself to
                    them, other than this friend of one of the founders who was saying that they
                    should hire me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had expertise. I mean learning in the field,
                        hadn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, not in advertising or marketing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I was an English major, and I had just finished a capital fund raising
                    campaign. So I was competing with the MBAs who came out with their
                    advertising/marketing backgrounds.</p>

                        questions. I think you've answered one, more or less, but I'd just like to
                        sum it up. Here you came out of a strong Irish background and up against the
                        people who've essentially been the enemies of the Irish -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter]Error! Bookmark not defined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or WASPs (white Anglo-Saxon Protestants), of the New
                        England establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, the old “No Irish Need Apply,” and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the WASP establishment? You
                        were in the heart of it for a while, and I'm asking what sort of impression
                        did you have of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I don't think I saw it so much as the WASP establishment. The thing that
                    struck me was the advantages and the different paths that are open to people who
                    have family means for education. And that was sort of an eye-opener to me: that
                    someone had sort of a world at their feet and could go to any school and could
                    have it financed by their folks. That was interesting to me.</p>
                <p>It may be intimidating at some point, but I wasn't really down with my own peers
                    for most of my four years there. I was dealing with people who were 20 or 30
                    years older than I was. These were terrific guys, and I was working really hard,
                    and I think doing a really good job. I always felt like they were supportive and
                    encouraging. This fellow Tim Ireland had no reason to take an interest and to
                    try to do this kind thing to help me get a job. I didn't even work with him that
                    directly. I just thought I was very lucky to have someone take an interest and
                    to help me get started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, something I think that has been a phenomena of the
                        period when women were somewhat discriminated against, or at least they had
                        a problem, was the mentor thing. Nobody said, “You mentor,” or something
                        like this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I think often you'd find older men for really
                        altruistic purposes would say, “Here is somebody. I'm going to make sure she
                        gets ahead,” and doing this much more so for a woman than for a man, because
                        a man, a young squirt, was kind of on his own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, it was just so kind! I remember going to Brown Brothers
                    Harriman, and I interviewed with people who were a few years older than me, and
                    I remember thinking, “This is not a planet I belong on.” First of all banking
                    would not be something I could be very good at. But they just seemed so staid
                    and formal. They were all Ivy League graduates - everybody - from their
                    undergraduate degrees to their graduate degrees, which I wasn't anywhere near
                    and I just didn't connect at all.</p>
                <p>But he would sort of kick off the meeting and say, “And Theresa, you know,
                    financed her own education?” I'm thinking, yea, you know. And that was a
                    remarkable thing to this group, that I financed my own education. But, you find
                    out that a lot of people did that. And took a typing course at night to qualify
                    for her first job. And all these things that I thought were, no, duh?this is
                    what you do. But it was just that he really gave me a lot of confidence and made
                    me feel like I was on the right track. I always believed I would go, and do, and
                    get ahead, and do well in business, or do well in some field; and I didn't know
                    what it was. It made me very nervous that I didn't know what it was.</p>
                <p>But I did think once I clicked into advertising, this firm was also a sort of
                    Connecticut firm - a lot of “white-shoe” Greenwich kids - and at that point I
                    felt I could compete and excel, and I had a different set of skills. Perhaps I
                    didn't have the confidence or assurance of having grown up with knowing that
                    there's this available to you, but I did have some drive, I think, that
                    compensated for the rest of those things. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a parenthetical note, you use the term “white-shoe,”
                        which I understand perfectly-</hi>

                        wear dirty white buck shoes [a light tan color suede buckskin shoe], and
                        this was sort of the mark of a prep school/New England college type
                        kid.</hi>

                <p>LOAR: Right. I do remember once, in this work with Andover, meeting someone who
                    was working with us in New York. She was a spouse who had gone to the Abbott
                    Academy, the women's academy. She was involved in some fund raising thing. She
                    came to the office once and was describing a Catholic wedding she went to. And
                    she said, “This girl was Catholic, but she was really terrific.”</p>
                <p>I'm thinking, “What do you mean Catholic?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then she just said, “And the good thing was, they gave us a piece of
                    paper to describe when you're supposed to kneel and when you do this.” And I'm
                    thinking it was just she did not mean to be insulting, but she was describing
                    this separate tribe, this strange ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She had gone to a wedding of a descendant of the Roosevelt family a couple
                    of weekends before, and she described that, and she said, “And can you imagine a
                    Catholic wedding coming close to this!” You know, [laughter] and now it clicked.
                    This is what my dad was referring to, back when he would read the newspapers and
                    say the Catholic weddings were at the back and the Irish were barely hidden
                    there in the announcements, and things like that.</p>
                <p>But I never felt it was a hostile environment. I thought Andover was a
                    fascinating place, and a place of excellence, and a mission I identified with.
                    And, it was older people who really did it to be good and kind, and to help you
                    get a foot in the door. And then I also felt, when I got a foot in the door, I
                    really wanted to excel, to show this person that their confidence in me and
                    their belief that I could do well were justified. And that was also another
                    thing that sort of pushed me to want to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in 1980 you went where? What was the name of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Dancer Fitzgerald Sample. It was one of the big advertising agencies,
                    which, right when I left in '86, merged into Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which is now
                    one of the big ones. So Dancer Fitzgerald Sample was a big, major, cool
                    advertising agency in the Chrysler Building, which was also a great place to go
                    work.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>But I also was sort of hedging my bets. (I'm just remembering now, in talking to
                    you.) One of the men I worked with directly in the office was a man named Dick
                    Lombard [Richard Lombard], who was a graduate of Andover; and he was the chair
                    of the Major Gifts Committee. He had gone to Andover and Dartmouth, and had
                    married into one of the General Motors' families - I'm trying to remember?Sloan
                    maybe?Kettering [Jane Olive Kettering], Kettering, the Kettering family. He was
                    another guy who was just terrific, and somewhat closer to my age. He was older,
                    but when you're 23, everybody's older [laughter]. But he was also another
                    terrific guy, and he really wanted me to go to business school. I was like, “You
                    don't know how bad I am at math when you're saying this [laughter],” but I was,
                    of course, too embarrassed to say that.</p>
                <p>So I was still actually thinking about going to business school, and I actually
                    applied. I took the horrible GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) course,
                    which was just dreadful. I got accepted. He helped me write a great
                    recommendation to NYU Business School [New York University Leonard N. Stern
                    School of Business], and I started going at night. And I just hated it! Well, I
                    must have taken the worst possible course first, and it was all engineering
                    students, and that was like people from another planet. It meant, also, I was
                    getting home very late at night to New Jersey because I was still commuting. I
                    thought I needed an advanced degree. I still to this day wish I had an advanced
                    degree. If I had life to do over again, I would have gutted through that MBA
                    course and just done it.</p>
                <p>That was the other course then. Actually, he was encouraging me to go up to Amos
                    Tuck School [of Business Administration at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire],
                    “take some time off, you don't have kids yet, your husband will understand, go
                    do this, and get,” he was really pushing me to try to get out and get my
                    business degree, which was excellent advice. I probably should have listened to
                    it; but I took a couple classes, and I just hated it. I guess I took statistics.
                    I scored very, very low on the English and the language stuff, and very poorly
                    on the math, and partly because I think one of my sisters and brothers went
                    ahead of me in the math class. We were all well behaved and the nuns probably
                    figured, “What the heck! Let's give her an A!” So it's not like I ever did
                    poorly grade wise in high school. I just never learned it, and it never caught
                    up with me, not even on the College Board exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So I did do that. When I first started working in advertising, I was also
                    going to business school at night, because I really felt I was competing with
                    all those MBAs. I had to know what they knew. But I just couldn't stand it.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I should mention this. When I first graduated from Rutgers, I also started my
                    masters in English literature at Rutgers because I thought I loved doing that.
                    Well, I didn't particularly like that either. I think I didn't even finish one
                    class. It was not practical working in New York; and it's different at the
                    graduate level; and I was now into the workplace, and I was less interested in
                    some of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, less of the artsy, fartsy stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes! I was more into doing the job, and learning new skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, what do you do in this job -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ... and how to dress for success — all those clich�s that were the
                    beginning of all those women coming into the workforce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All very important at the beginning. Well, tell me. You
                        were '80 to '86 with this advertising firm. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I started at the lowest possible place you could come in at. First of
                    all, I remember the director of personnel - like real annoyed that they had to
                    hire me because this guy was just pushing, pushing. So they did bring me in and
                    they paid me an MBA rate, which I think was something really high, like $17,000
                    or $20,000; and I was so like, wow! I can't tell my family. This is so much
                    money I'm embarrassed by this! But it was pretty cool, you know.</p>
                <p>I started at the lowest possible account. It was for a bug spray. It was for a
                    pesticide made in North Carolina. The client was from North Carolina, which was
                    like another culture. I thought, “I'm open to Kentucky. I know outside of New
                    York.” What was it? It was a bug killer, Spectracide; and that was really
                    considered a low account. But without an MBA, they weren't going to risk me on
                    any highly sophisticated clients. And I did that, and had a really jerk for a
                    boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>LOAR: Within an advertising agency there's account management, there's the
                    creative team, and there's the media team. Account management is the middle hub.
                    You are the direct contact with the client. But you also work within the
                    advertising agency to work with the creative, media, and research teams, so you
                    know where to place the ads and how the ads from the creative team should be
                    developed. But a good account manager sort of develops relationships within the
                    agency and with your client. Your client has to have total confidence; and the
                    people inside the agency have to feel like you are really representing their
                    interests and respecting what they do; especially the creative people, because
                    at the end of the day, if the creative people are not comfortable with you,
                    you're not going to get great advertising for your client, and your client is
                    not going to be happy with your work.</p>
                <p>So you know, I had a good ol' boy client, who I'd go out to dinner with and it
                    was horrible! I was assistant account executive. I don't even know if he had an
                    account executive because it was such a crummy account. And then there was this
                    account manager, who said I could meet with him from six to eight in the evening
                    because he wasn't available until six. And I remember sitting in the office. He
                    would be cursing, and abusive, and say these foul things about women, and just
                    gross things that just totally turned me off - but yes, I did my work.</p>
                <p>I don't remember how long I was on that account. We were not even in the main
                    part of the agency, we were so low. So I spent a lot of my time walking through
                    the other sections with people who were working for Proctor and Gamble, and
                    other accounts. Only in the cafeteria would all the assistant account executives
                    get together because we all came in as a training class. I wanted to stay and
                    get a decent account.</p>
                <p>Then fairly quickly — and I don't remember how long this was — there was an
                    opening on Wendy's fast food. That was another account that was kind of sneered
                    at because it wasn't really sophisticated marketers, and it was fast food, and
                    it wasn't P&amp;G (Proctor &amp; Gamble) or General Mills. You know, MBAs went
                    on the client's accounts. But I kind of just — I don't know how I learned about
                    this opening — got moved over there as an assistant account executive, and that
                    was a blast. I just had a fabulous time working on Wendy's, and that was really,
                    really fun!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you explain what Wendy's is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Wendy's Fast Food Restaurant is a national chain of fast food restaurants,
                    and when I came onto the account, they were in the burger wars with Burger King
                    and McDonald's, and they were really pushing to get ahead. So I was brought on
                    as the junior account executive. It was a fairly large account, and we had I
                    don't know how many millions of dollars of billing. But the big thing was they
                    did heavy national advertising. That was a desirable thing, because what we want
                    is to work on campaigns that get on national TV (television) across the
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>But it was also that Wendy's is unusual, in that you have a client based in Ohio,
                    so you have a marketing department in Ohio (Columbus, Ohio, which was my dad's
                    hometown. So that was cool, and I was going to be able to see what the heck my
                    father's hometown was like) and you also had these franchisees, who were
                    individual people who owned series of Wendy's franchises across the country. So
                    you had guys from the rural South who were very successful businessmen and knew
                    what they wanted in their advertising, and you had these people who did it from
                    a corporate angle in another part of the country. So that was one client.</p>
                <p>The other client was the marketing department. So you had to have good
                    relationships with both. I had above me an account executive, who was an
                    interesting, highly aggressive guy, who I learned a lot from. I learned what not
                    to do. I had an account supervisor above him, who was an interesting guy, who
                    did magic tricks and fell asleep at client meetings. Then a management
                    supervisor above him, one based in New York and went back and forth, into/out of
                    Columbus. His name was Charlie Rath [Charles W. Rath]. He became a very good,
                    long-term friend and mentor in many ways, including family life and everything -
                    a great guy. Then, above him was a management supervisor, a guy named Joe Mack
                    [Joseph P. Mack], who I became very close to. He became president of the agency
                    at one point. He just became a great supporter and I learned a lot from this a
                    tremendously effective, decent person.</p>
                <p>What you do as an assistant account executive is competitive spending analyses,
                    and I'd have to take these home because I could not figure out percentages. I
                    could do the basics, but you'd have to figure out what Burger King was spending
                    in each market compared to what we were spending. Why was it my job to do this?
                    I look back at it; the media people should have been doing this. But we had to
                    look at it, and then we had to compare their advertising. So you wanted to see
                    how your client fit in. This is really a low, little job. But I had a lot of
                    trouble making sure my numbers were right. So I'd take it home, and Richard
                    would help me at night. God bless him. He'd sit there, and he could do it in his
                    head because he's really good at it, and figure it out for me, so I didn't
                    embarrass myself by figuring my percentages wrong! And then you had to present
                    it to the client. So you would learn presentation skills. And I always say that
                    the stuff I learned in advertising on presentation, packaging, and ideas were
                    very valuable for the Foreign Service. You had to learn how to present to a
                    client.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the difference between the suits up in
                        the main office and the guys who were out there running these very small

                <p>LOAR: Well, the fascinating thing is — I'll never forget this — first, we had an
                    incredibly fabulous creative team assigned to Wendy's, which is why Wendy's was
                    a stellar account for the agency for a long time. We had the best advertising
                    and that team was led by Cliff Freeman, who's still a good friend, and has done
                    some work for us now on our new nonprofit venture with Vital Voices. I remember
                    Cliff presenting a whole slew of commercials to a group of franchisees
                    [laughter], and one guy jumps out of his seat and says, “That dog will hunt!
                    That dog will hunt!” And I'm like, “okay; I guess that means it's good!”
                    [Laughter]</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But the funny thing is, the head guy, the guy who was a liaison between our
                    agency and the client, the really strongest link — a man, Charlie Rath — was
                    really a clever guy. He worked very well with the franchisees (you know, that
                    dog will hunt) and the suits. And Wendy's, they taught us just to lay hands on,
                    and probably still is, apparently from the advertising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was just such an unusual account, an unusual experience. I had a chance
                    to learn how to present. We did another horrible, long project. I thought I
                    would never get through these projects. I also had to do a project, an
                    advertising planner, for the franchisees; this was another low job because it
                    was black and white print advertising. Who cares? But that is really low! So I
                    was really the lowest level in the creative team, but I took it so seriously. I
                    just made it like the premier. I kept a copy of (I have it in my attic) the
                    advertising planner for Wendy's that the franchisees could use. They were crazy
                    about it, because they had print ads for each of their products, and they had
                    banners. It was everything they could possibly want.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Luckily the franchisees needed it. This was a crummy job nobody wanted to
                    do, and it was done. And there's another thing I learned - you do the crummiest
                    little job extremely well, and suddenly it's not a crummy job anymore. You've
                    transformed it, and that is a good lesson.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm just thinking from the point of view of the
                        executive. They give it to a young, relatively unskilled person to work on.
                        But what you do is you get both enthusiasm and really some very hard work.
                        But, in a way, what is considered a crummy job by the upper echelon -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean if you're selling hamburgers, you want to make sure
                        you get good advertisements in the local papers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. For the franchisees these local advertisements were important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's really the guts of the business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. But it was very good experience, and presenting that to the client
                    gave me a lot of polish, and I learned how to do all these things.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I kept working my way up. I got promoted to account executive, and
                    then the account manager fell asleep at one too many meetings [laughter], and
                    then I had no account manager. So it was me in New York in the Chrysler
                    Building, with my friend, Charlie Rath, based in Columbus, working for my
                    agency, but very close to the client; and Joe Mack at the very senior level; and
                    that's who I dealt with in the mornings. So I'd come in at a quarter to seven,
                    or seven o'clock when he did, and he was always there at seven o'clock; and I
                    really worked with this guy who was several ranks up from me. I learned so much,
                    which was very, very important. I think a lot of my fast promotions and
                    accelerated progress was because I had the chance to work with this very senior
                    guy who was demanding as heck. You do not make mistakes. I loved a boss like
                    that because I didn't want to make mistakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I wanted to learn a lot from very good people. I had a great relationship
                    with the creative team. It was a very interesting time in the advertising world.
                    There was a lot of cocaine; there was a lot of wild stuff going on. And, here I
                    was and I didn't even know it! Somebody was drooling in my meeting once, some
                    producer and someone said, “Oh, she's a little cokehead.” I'm like, “Oh, is that
                    what a cokehead looks like?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>LOAR: And how fascinating! They're working on our account, and I'm relying on her
                    to develop a production estimate!</p>
                <p>But there were a lot of interesting things: I had my eyes opened to a whole other
                    world of fast-paced creative content and learned how to have a good respect for
                    the relationship with the creative team; and that was good.</p>
                <p>I remember one other thing when I first started on that bug spray. That was such
                    a crummy little account. It didn't even have big enough billings to qualify for
                    a whole assistant junior account executive. So I also was put on this thing for
                    Thomas's pita bread. They were going to launch this, and I had to do store
                    checks. Now this is the other thing that's at the very lowest that you can do in
                    an advertising agency. You have to go around to stores in your area, and see how
                    many stores actually carry the product and how many spaces on the shelf. It was
                    a marketing thing -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And boring as hell. But I rented a car, and I did 77 stores in two days!
                    [Laughter] I came back and I reported on 77 stores, and they said, “Usually you
                    do 10 to 15!” [Laughter] I was like, “I'm going to cover all of Queens, all the
                    Bronx, all of this county,” and I had it all written up, and I turned it in, and
                    they were like, “You know?you really did a lot of stores.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I thought I should cover all those. I think they should know that, and they
                    shouldn't just know what the Hispanic neighborhood was doing, but they needed to
                    know every neighborhood. And I just remember the guy who was a real, real WASPy
                    Connecticut guy saying, “You know, you're going to go far, because you don't see
                    any limitations on a project. You define it, and the 77 is - you're really - you
                    usually do about 10 to 12!” [Laughter] But there again, I just knew that I had
                    pride, and that is really important.</p>
                <p>And then I had this great chance to work with this senior fellow, Joe Mack, here
                    in New York, and then Charlie Rath, who was just a great human being! And these
                    guys, they were just?you know, I worked my tush off.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I was totally honest; that was the other thing. Another thing of my old Catholic
                    background — Catholic school training helped — the client trusted me. I didn't
                    lie. I didn't BS (bullshit). I didn't spin. I said, “This is what things cost.
                    Here's where we are on the product. Here's where we are on this, and here's
                    where we are on that.” And they believed me and trusted me, and that was
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Wendy's do in the war while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, it was great! It was so much fun! We used to have my old boss's
                    cartoons that were in the newspaper at the time, the political cartoons. One of
                    the political cartoons had the United Nations; and it had, you know, Wendy's,
                    Burger King, McDonald's, (you know, the burger wars) and what was going on
                    there. I was actually deposed by Burger King's advertising because they wanted
                    to know whether we were misleading when we were developing our stuff, and of
                    course we weren't! We had all gone through Wendy's hamburger training school,
                    which I thought was a blast. We all had to learn how to serve the food and work
                    in the various parts of it. We all had to try the product, which became a
                    lifelong obsession with my family for Wendy's, because my husband loves Wendy's.
                    We eat Wendy's chicken sandwiches twice a week to this day! Many years later,
                    now, we have to go out of our way to find a Wendy's!</p>
                <p>But Wendy's did really well, and their sales went up, and our advertising was
                    fabulous. We did some white bread stuff, and then we did really fabulous
                    creative stuff. When Cliff Freeman and his team really could come to the front,
                    we did the whole incredibly funny series with -</p>

                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Okay. I'm happy to do it, but I don't want to be a bore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape 2, side 1, with Theresa Loar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We would go out to California for two or three weeks at a time to shoot
                    commercials, and stay in fabulous hotels, and Aerosmith, the rock band, would be
                    at the same hotel, and it was really a blast. This was just really, really fun,
                    and great relationship with the client. The franchisees seemed to like the work,
                    but I didn't have as much contact with them as we got more into the national
                    campaign.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Burger King or your outfit, your advertising group, at
                        all pointed towards international affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>LOAR: No. It was American consumers we were looking at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I'm trying to get my chronology here, how I went from that to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're '80 to '86 was the advertising firm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. We did this whole very funny series of like a Russian — the idea
                    being that at Wendy's you have a choice to make your sandwich any way you like.
                    It's not, “Give me a hamburger,” “Here it is.” And that was the big thing then.
                    So it was this very funny series of commercials featuring a Russian fashion
                    show. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh! I remember that! Yes, that was wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Where the Russian ladies are walking down the runway</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looks like Nina Khrushchev, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, and it's beachwear, and they have one outfit on; and then evening
                    wear, and they have the same outfit only with the flashlight, just very funny,
                    over the top - you know, very clear manifestations that at Wendy's you get a
                    choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then we did, of course, the biggest one of all time, which was “Where's
                    the Beef?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which even moved into the political campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That's right, and I can't tell you how many people I've met who took credit
                    for moving it into the political campaign, including a senator, a speechwriter,
                    and a political operative, who all said they were responsible for taking that
                    and putting it into the debates with the candidate, whose name I'm
                    forgetting.</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>LOAR: Walter Mondale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is '84.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Ronald Reagan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, and they said, “We are the ones who?” Each one of them said, “I
                    personally am?” [Laughter], which I thought was very interesting. One time, I
                    was at a State Department offsite with members of Tim Wirth's set of senior
                    staff and the people in the building he felt were really supporting his agenda
                    when he was the Undersecretary for Global Affairs. And there was a guy there
                    who, as we all went around, introduced ourselves, and talked about our
                    background, said, “I'm very proud of the fact that I took the “Where's the
                    beef?” which was an advertising term, and put it into Walter Mondale's speeches,
                    and used that for the debate.” And then it came around to me, and he said,
                    “Well, delighted to know that!” because I was actually at the advertising agency
                    when we created that and wrote that. So glad we could use it for a good, strong,
                    democratic candidate, which was a pretty interesting thing.</p>
                <p>But going back, that was really, really fun; and I really felt like I would do
                    very well in advertising. I loved it, and I excelled at it, and I was making
                    money, and getting bonuses, and feeling very confident. I was feeling like maybe
                    I could even have a child now, because I know I can earn a living. Richard was
                    agreeable to that, and we started to think about starting a family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you have your child, or children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Our first son was in '83. When I had my first son Michael, who's leaving
                    for college in a few days, I was at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample. I came back to
                    work, and was one of the first women on a professional staff to come back to
                    work after having a child; and I was very nervous about that because I didn't
                    know how that would affect both of my roles; but I was very careful. Joe Mack —
                    I had worked for under his supervision for a period of time — who was running
                    our major accounts in New York, said, “Well, why don't you come back and work on
                    Nabisco/RJR Reynolds, because they're based in New Jersey, and most of the
                    clients are women who have young children at home or starting to have their
                    families,” which was a great management decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>LOAR: I didn't want to go out to California for three weeks at a time, but I
                    didn't want to acknowledge that I was different now that I had a child, because
                    you couldn't. It was not common!</p>
                <p>There was only one other woman who had ever come back, and she came back
                    part-time, and she never got promoted again. So I was really trying to figure
                    out if there was a way I could continue my movement up the chain and still have
                    a family life. It wasn't at all clear you could do that.</p>
                <p>And I probably overcompensated. I didn't want to show pictures of home. You know,
                    “Look! That's over there, and this is over here.” But then I had wonderful
                    clients and a much easier lifestyle, and was not away at shoots for a long
                    period of time, and that was very important, and very good.</p>
                <p>And then somewhere along the line there I got promoted to account supervisor,
                    which was the next step up the chain - from account executive to account
                    supervisor - and that was terrific. I remember being on maternity leave during
                    part of the evaluations, and I got my full-year's bonus. This is their kind of
                    management team, a very smart management team, because they could have said,
                    “Well, since you're on maternity leave out of the office for, I think?I don't
                    know what it was?ten weeks or twelve weeks, that you're not going to get your
                    bonus.” But they didn't - full bonus, highly valued to come back, put you on a
                    great account make it work with your lifestyle, very smart, very productive work
                    environment. It was something that I thought — since I was trying to figure this
                    out, and I didn't know exactly what the work environment would be like — was
                    very good. So it allowed me to continue to do that and feel like I could balance
                    all this, and getting the sequence of what accounts win. We also started
                    thinking, “Wow, you know, this is great! Let's have another child!” This is
                    where the Foreign Service came into it. I don't remember the thinking exactly,
                    except that I do know that my husband at that time was doing very well as a real
                    estate lawyer in Manhattan. He was at a big firm, making big money, and was
                    being recruited. Donald Trump asked him to come work for him, who was, you know,
                    a big-time developer (and not with the best reputation).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. My son-in-law has done architectural work for Donald
                        Trump, and he makes a point of always getting paid first [laughter] before
                        he does his work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, well, this is the time when he was talking about tearing down landmark
                    buildings. Interesting, interesting job opportunities; my husband was picked up
                    by a limo and escorted to a meeting with Trump. But it was just not his cup of
                    tea [laughter]; he didn't feel at all comfortable with that!</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>But he was doing very well in the firm, and I was doing very well in advertising
                    - not at his rate of compensation, as real estate lawyers in Manhattan in the
                    '80s were doing very, very well. And I loved this work, and I felt like, okay, I
                    can do this with my son, and [when I] look back on it, I probably was not
                    focused enough on the fact that I was a new mother. I was still just trying to
                    figure out how I could do both things and maintain a financial independence,
                    because I felt I had this responsibility now to take care of this child.</p>
                <p>But also, right at this time of our first son, there was another thing that
                    happened. I was on maternity leave. We had a weekend house in Flemington, New
                    Jersey. I started thinking about starting a small business, and now on that
                    maternity leave we did. And that's a whole other thing. We started a cookie
                    store, and I got my friends from advertising, a wonderful guy named John Licata,
                    fabulous art director, to design a logo for the cookie store. I developed the
                    recipes, and my brother helped a lot with buying equipment. Richard and I did
                    this together. Richard found the location. And now I guess it was around '83, so
                    I guess I missed that. But that was a fabulous experience of starting something
                    from scratch and running a successful business.</p>
                <p>And then when I went back to work after having my first son Michael. It became
                    harder to run that business from New York City, where I was during the week. I
                    was no longer out at this weekend house, and it was hard because I had some
                    pretty wacky staff who would call me and ask, you know, “Am I supposed to clean
                    utensils before I clock out or after?” [Laughter] So it became harder to keep
                    doing that business while working in advertising. It was really a weekend
                    business. We had heavy foot traffic on the weekends. It was the time of Mrs.
                    Fields and cookies, and people indulging in expensive cookies while they were
                    shopping was very common. And, we were right in the middle of the heavy foot
                    traffic area in this town that had a lot of little outlets. It was really fun to
                    start something, to see it be successful, to make money, to have total control
                    over what you were doing. We got a lot of help from the family, which was nice.
                    My brother was our beverage manager, which Rich and I got a kick out of. It was
                    fun for Richard and me to do this!</p>
                <p>We were running the store; we had this weekend house; we had this apartment in
                    New York; and we really wanted to have a second child. Then we started thinking,
                    “Well, we have to do something worthwhile with our lives. You know, all this
                    money and income and success. The money's unbelievable! “ Yes, but quite
                    seriously, we really did think, you know, we always were very idealistic about
                    what we should do with our lives, and you know, real estate law and advertising
                    weren't fulfilling that for us; and I think, because it had been a very rapid
                    march up the ladder for both of us, we felt confident that we could do this
                    wherever we were.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>One afternoon, we were sitting on the porch of our old Victorian house in
                    Flemington, New Jersey (this is where we went on the weekends so I could sort
                    of, you know, keep an eye on the cookie store). It was a quiet, nice place out
                    of the city, out of New York City, where we were living. There was an article in
                    the New York Times Magazine about the Foreign Service. It said, “If you can pass
                    this quiz, you could be a good Foreign Service officer, or you could take a
                    test.” I tell you, I've never seen anything in the newspaper since then, and I
                    would really recommend they think about that for recruitment. So, we were just
                    fooling around taking it, and thought, “This is cool! Why don't we take that
                    Foreign Service exam?” We'd thought about the Peace Corps; but frankly, I didn't
                    want to be a teacher and I thought the roles for women in the Peace Corps, if
                    you didn't know how to teach, was pretty limited.</p>
                <p>I don't know if that was accurate, but I just didn't want to be a teacher. I
                    didn't think I would be a wonderful teacher. And so then he said, “Well, Foreign
                    Service. This is something cool,” sort of like what my Uncle Jimmy, Jim McCabe,
                    had done, and why not? So we didn't tell anybody and just took the Foreign
                    Service exam, and Richard passed the first time, and I didn't. I was under by a
                    few points. But we were still going to move ahead because now we had this idea.
                    This was good, and noble, and a good thing to do, and we would love it, and it'd
                    be fun, and why not? What do we have to lose? These incomes, we can get these
                    anytime.</p>
                <p>We really wanted to have another child before we did this, and we were very
                    lucky. On the weekend we found out I was pregnant with my second child, I got a
                    promotion at my advertising agency, my cookie store had reached some level of
                    sales and success, and?what was the other thing?and something related to the
                    Foreign Service. I don't know if it was then that I found out that I had passed
                    the second time I took it. The second time I took it I had pink eye, so my eye
                    just sort of shut down. I had one eye open, and I was like, “I am not taking
                    this ****** exam.” I loved taking exams. I don't let them bother me in the
                    least. So we made it through, and I just squeaked over the line. Because I was
                    pregnant with my second son, the Foreign Service held up Richard. So in the
                    recruiting process, it wasn't as painful as it could be for a lot of people
                    coming in together, tandem couples, because my pregnancy status sort of slowed
                    Richard down. So, we had to wait for this child to be born and to pass a health
                    clearance.</p>
                <p>Richard came down for his oral exam, and I think he did it, or did he do it in
                    New York, and he just ripped right through it, and we felt great about it. I
                    came down to New York for my exam, my oral exam, and I remember feeling it was
                    like a lark. I felt no stress. I remember taking the exam, the oral exam; and
                    this was, I guess, '85 or so (let's see?Patrick wasn't born yet, so it was '85),
                    and you know, coming into a room with all the people grilling you on all these
                    questions. I loved that! I felt like this is like advertising. It's competitive,
                    it's tough, you have to get in there, you have to BS them if you don't know the
                    answer, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>LOAR: And I remember the questions I didn't know.</p>
                <p>But in the meantime, when I had failed it the first year and had to wait for the
                    next year (I know this is going in a lot of different directions), but I read a
                    lot of the New York Times, even the things I found boring and not at all
                    interesting; and this is the advice I'd give to anybody who wants to take the
                    Foreign Service exam, is to read the New York Times, especially the things
                    you're not interested in.</p>
                <p>You can forget the sports section, but that's about it. Everything else,
                    especially economies in other countries - what's going on in the business
                    development in the world economy, you have to read all that. I got a series of
                    books from the Council on Foreign Relations in New York; and I'd read their
                    little brochures; and I would read their pamphlets about what's going on in
                    South Africa, what's going on in Latin America, and stuff I'd never studied in
                    college. I would read it; and I would, with my son Michael, you know, being a
                    little baby, or a one-year-old or two-year-old at this point, I just read and
                    read, and studied, and studied; and I found it really interesting, something
                    which I didn't have any interest in it in college. But I really found it
                    interesting, and would go to lectures that the Council on Foreign Relations
                    would have — anything I could do to learn about foreign affairs. When I took the
                    test again, I, did pass it, and then came down for the oral; and I found the
                    oral to be invigorating!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions that were asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. I remember, “Would you compare the tax reform plans of?” I don't know
                    if it was Bill Bradley and Jack Kemp? This is what I'm vaguely remembering, and
                    I was like, “No, I'd prefer not to.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That was the one I didn't know anything about. But let me tell you about
                    something else. Let's do that, and I knew part of it was not that you knew
                    everything but that you could handle yourself. Like no, I don't really know a
                    lot about that, but you know, yes, we need reform in our tax code. Let's move
                    on!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That was a terrible one. They asked me about unions and trade labor
                    movements. I knew that, you know, from my background. But also, I'd been reading
                    everything. I'd been reading, really studying, and it made me have a broader set
                    of interests in that year that I was reading, and studying like crazy, and
                    really focusing on trying to understand all of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>I remember getting a cultural question, which my husband still teases me about,
                    and it was a funny cultural question, because I thought culture, okay, you're
                    talking to the woman who knows. I can handle this! I was trying to talk about
                    some woman who was a conductor, and I used the name of an actress, a common
                    actress, instead; and so the guy said, “Do you really mean that?” And I was like
                    “Yea,” like I'm thinking, “This guy doesn't know who this conductor is? He
                    doesn't know this woman conductor!” and I can't remember this woman's name. She
                    was one of the first women conductors in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know who you mean, and I can't remember either
                        [laughter]!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I was so impressed with her. I was always looking for women of
                    achievement and learning about them, and wanting to know about them. How'd they
                    do that? How did they become a woman conductor when all the others were men?
                    How'd you get the guts to do that? I always wanted to talk about that.</p>
                <p>I was using the name of an actress, and it was very embarrassing. But then they
                    also asked about different magazines and different things like this, and I could
                    go on and on, and you know, I felt very confident. I felt very comfortable. I
                    did feel that the people who were asking me the questions were just like people
                    to talk to. I didn't find it challenging. Some people find it grueling. I'm
                    thinking, “You want to talk? Let's talk. I'm ready.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: “I know the world! But if I don't, it doesn't throw me.” It was very
                    comfortable, and I didn't feel stress. I liked it. I liked the competition of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>And then we had to do this whole thing of negotiations they did, and this was
                    part of the exam. And I remember one guy at the table. I'm thinking, “He's
                    really sharp. I'm not going to square him into this, because he'll end up
                    hurting me. So I have got to be careful with him because he's very sharp!” And
                    he actually came into the Foreign Service, and I would see him in the State
                    Department hallways. He did very well - I think his name is John Fini - and I
                    always noticed his career because I remember thinking, even in the oral exam I
                    was noticing, this guy is really sharp and on the ball. There was somebody who
                    was so dreadful I thought she was put in as a ringer, and I thought, “You can't
                    be serious. This person can't be contemplating being a diplomat!” But I figured
                    they put in this device of tough person to throw us off to see how we could
                    handle an unwelcome person who was hostile and difficult, and it was. We had
                    this budget to do to do a certain number of things and how are we going to split
                    it up? So I kind of waited and said, “Well, I'll just take this little
                    percentage here.” I don't know what percentage it was, and it was lower than an
                    equal amount, and I figured, “I'll just take a little lower and see how that
                    goes.” And then they came in and said, “You have ten minutes left,” and they
                    observed you, of course. Ten minutes left. The budget's been cut in half. What
                    are you going to do? And I don't remember how my negotiating went, but I loved
                    that session!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I thought that was really fun.</p>
                <p>Then we had the “in basket,” this thing where you're the person, and I had some.
                    “In basket” was like work. Here's your stack of work. You have to get it done,
                    and blah, blah. I scored a 99 on that one. I loved that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Then you had to write, and you could choose a topic to write on; and they picked
                    equal pay for comparable work, and I was like, that's an issue I cared about -
                    like women getting paid, whether the secretaries in universities should be paid
                    the same as janitors, or how does that go? It was equal pay for comparable work.
                    There were some cases I had been following because I was very interested to know
                    how women were going to be paid in their workplace. I was able to write a really
                    (I thought) good, persuasive essay on it and on why it was important to both
                    sides, and blah, blah, blah.</p>
                <p>And I think that was it. I don't think there were other elements of it. But I
                    left there thinking, “You know, I gave it a great shot.” Actually I did well on
                    it, so that was a nice thing.</p>
                <p>And then our second son was born, which was wonderful; and we decided to make the
                    move; and it was really like jumping off a cliff. We had no idea what we were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask. I mean moving from where you were,
                        sort of from really on the upward scale or something, would you say -was
                        there a sense of idealism that came in doing something? Was it for fun, or
                        really we ought to do something for the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think because we were so confident after having done well, both of
                    us — and that came easy to us - to do well in our respective fields — and thus,
                    we did have a sense that we should serve, serve our country, do something that
                    we'd be proud of. Especially when you have your first child, you think, “What do
                    you want to show this child? What values do you want to pass along?” I always
                    called it “the postpartum ambition.” I mean I really wanted to start a cookie
                    store, I wanted to do something in the world; but I was more driven to do good,
                    important things with my life than ever before.</p>
                <p>And, if you can see, “Okay, that's a way to get money,” and I thought that would
                    be such a cool thing because I didn't have that; and that was something I didn't
                    even know how to do; and I learned, well, that's what you do to get money - you
                    do this in the business - and I don't mean to demean that, and that was
                    wonderful. But it wasn't like the deeply satisfying thing I thought it would be
                    - to make money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I've often felt for example, I've been doing these
                        oral histories now for about 16 years, off and on, that to interview
                        successful the-equivalent-of account executives or real estate lawyers, you
                        know?I couldn't be doing it for that long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it just isn't?it's great to make, and I don't
                        demean it. But at the same time, there's nothing that you particularly want
                        to pass on to the next generation like you do with the people who've been
                        involved with American foreign affairs. I mean this is just me, but I think
                        it's true in the greater scheme of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. There is something. I mean the State Department itself does have a
                    culture of people who really want to get out there and really do good things.
                    It's an interesting culture! There's a mix and hierarchy is a difficult thing.
                    But I really felt, and then partly because my uncle had done this, and he was
                    such a hero to the family, so important in my family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was in AID (United States Agency for International
                        Development), wasn't he, doing -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>LOAR: He was AID in Japan after the war. But he was such a wonderful person to
                    me, and what he did for the family, and his ideals, and plans, and what he
                    thought you do with your life. At his home he has a perpetual flame to FDR
                    (Franklin D. Roosevelt) and JFK (John F. Kennedy). He's passed on now, maybe
                    four or five years ago. My understanding is that that perpetual flame is still
                    there. FDR saved the country, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Just going back too, I know this was in my thinking, that you do good
                    things, but also that it could be glamorous and - not glamorous because
                    glamorous is one thing - it could be fulfilling and important, not just
                    something for the good. There's not much social working in an inner city, but
                    it's something that could be fulfilling at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think, too, that there is something that often is
                        discounted by people who are in the Foreign Service because it sounds almost
                        a little too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Pollyannaish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pollyannaish or something. But as a practical fact, the
                        United States is preeminent in the world during this period, and God knows
                        how long it will last. But at the same time, if you're working for the
                        United States, you do feel you have a mission bringing peace to people, and
                        all this. No other country really picks that up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean it's kind of: if you're not going to do it, nobody
                        else is going to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This can't help but transmit itself into a certain amount
                        of sometimes missionary, a little too good, they sure made a lot of
                        mistakes, and all that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Too much judgmental thinking sometimes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at the same time, it's there. Am I correct in saying
                        that this is somewhat of the feeling you??</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>LOAR: Service, and also like seeing other parts of the world, experiencing
                    things, rolling up our sleeves, trying ourselves in another area. Richard had a
                    great interest in this and was really fluent in it; and still, he's just really
                    terrific at understanding all the complex political situations about a country
                    and being able to articulate it. He's fabulous at that. He really is.</p>
                <p>There was this sense of, like my Uncle James McCabe. My son had to do a project -
                    interview someone of his grandparent's generation; and my mom was up in New
                    Jersey, so that was hard; so we interviewed his great uncle. In interviewing my
                    Uncle Jimmy I heard things I never heard before. It was his thinking, and it
                    just made me realize this was built in. He said that the day that Hitler marched
                    into Poland, he marched onto a train and came down to Washington, to FDR, to
                    help FDR stand up against tyrants around the world.</p>
                <p>And I think when I was working in advertising and making a lot of money - when I
                    worked in Andover, my parents did not have any comprehension of that
                    particularly. They kind of had this vague idea of how many Catholics are
                    involved in that school? [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But they were just proud of me for going out, and earning a living and
                    never judgmental, just always encouraging. When I worked in advertising, they
                    were sort of like, “You're a huckster!” You know, it's like, “Yea, it's good
                    you're making money; and yea, it's good you're taking care of your child; but
                    why you're using your maiden name is beyond me!” [Laughter] “And why you're not
                    spending more time, why you're not at home with your child is, you know,” but it
                    was never like pushing it too much. When I ran my cookie store, my father
                    learned I made a profit on the tins. He said, “Why do you make a profit? Why
                    don't you sell them just for what they are?” “Because then I won't make a
                    profit, Dad!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>So the idea of making money, there's some distrust there. And advertising was
                    like, well, you're putting these things on TV and you're trying to get people to
                    buy things, right? There was nothing, “But what is that?” And that?and it wasn't
                    any heavy-handed thing, but it was, “Well, that's good honey.”</p>
                <p>There was some fun and vigor just because you're making so much money, and I'm
                    how do you do that if you're doing it in an honest way [laughter]. You know,
                    there are other branches of Irish families where health, wealth, and success is
                    highly valued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It wasn't particularly valued.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>But the funny thing is, once I passed the Foreign Service exam (just jump ahead),
                    when I came down to training, my parents came down to visit us once when we were
                    in training. My dad and mom walked from where we were staying over to
                    Georgetown, and they came back, and my father said, “You know, I've talked to
                    some people on campus, and I told them, 'My daughter is a Foreign Service
                    officer now, just starting.'" I think then he really understood what a Foreign
                    Service officer was, and he said, “You know, we're very proud of you, and we're
                    very proud of Richard.” And it was funny because I think that is sort of what we
                    were raised to do. I just felt very lucky to have a chance to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, okay. Well then, you entered the Foreign Service
                        when, in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You both came in at the same time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you designated what cone you wanted to be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, Richard knew he wanted a political, and he had scored well enough to
                    do political. My score gave me two options - admin (administration) or consular
                    - and I thought consular was managing people and resources, and I could do that;
                    and I didn't talk to a soul, mind you, about what consular work was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And we had no clue that at that time the political officers were the
                    princes of the embassy -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And the consular were like, we're so lucky, you know, so happy we can give
                    you some employment [laughter], the lower rung -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>LOAR: The lesser folks in the kingdom. But we just jumped in, and really we had
                    talked to one couple who are a tandem couple, called the Grahams. A guy I worked
                    with in advertising, in the office next to mine, his cousins were in the Foreign
                    Service. We talked to them - Russell Graham was the husband - talked to them
                    once or twice on the phone. They gave us some advice, which meant nothing to us
                    because we had no clue what that meant in managing your career. We had talked to
                    somebody at AFSA (American Foreign Service Association), who gave us some vague
                    advice. I was really trying to figure out this cone thing. Was I going to be
                    disadvantaged? I don't want to be coming in at some disadvantage. Of course, you
                    do as the consular officer. In the old days in their hierarchy, you were a
                    second-class citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I remember, I was in the consular cone the whole
                        time. Can we talk about the Foreign Service, the basic officer course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean here's the first chance to look at the beast, about
                        the new people who are coming in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was so much fun for us. This was an exhilarating time, and we look
                    at that as one of the great, fun times of our lives, because we had just had our
                    second son, and I was ready to come in, like four weeks after he was born. I'm
                    like totally clueless what it was like to have a second child. And there was a
                    young woman named Lisa Parisik, who said, “Well, I really think it'd be great if
                    you and Richard came in together,” because they were offering us different times
                    of classes, and she said, “Let's get you on the same track.” In that part she
                    made our life so much easier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: A great individual - she was working for Patrick Kennedy at one point,
                    which made great sense, because Patrick is a great manager and a great promoter
                    of Foreign Service personnel, and always looking out for the Foreign Service -
                    and Lisa just did what no one else was really paying attention to and doing, and
                    which we didn't know quite how to, and didn't feel we had any say in. She put us
                    on the same track, so we started our classes together, because we weren't
                    originally on the same track. Someone else had offered me a class at one time
                    and Richard another, and she said, “No. We're going to put you together in the
                    same class.”</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>So then I had, I think, six months of maternity leave, which was glorious with
                    this second child. So it means leaving our apartment in New York, leaving our
                    110-year old Victorian home, selling our cookie store in Flemington, New Jersey
                    (we couldn't keep that up anymore), and basically saying good bye to the family
                    that we were so, so, so close to, and moving down to Washington for this great
                    adventure.</p>
                <p>We came into the A-100 class together; found a wonderful nanny who was great,
                    young college girl, a Mormon who lived with us (another wonderful experience
                    learning about the Mormon religion, having this girl live with us); and we had
                    double per diem, double training thing. One of the few benefits tandems get, is
                    when you're in training, you get double stuff. So we got into the cool little
                    townhouse in Georgetown. So we could walk over to FSI (Foreign Service
                    Institute), walk our little son to Holy Trinity Nursery School right near
                    Georgetown University, and we had plenty of spending cash. Our salaries went
                    from very significant salaries to two of us together making less really than I
                    made in advertising, and our quality of life wasn't affected. We had live-in
                    help with the kids. We could walk to what we needed to do. We still saw our
                    family a lot, both Richard's family and mine, because they came down to
                    Washington, and it was just very cool.</p>
                <p>We started in A-100 class, and it was really a fun class, and we're still close,
                    as they say you will be, to a lot of the people we started in that class with. I
                    remember thinking, you know, “What the heck. I don't have an advanced degree in
                    foreign affairs, I'm not a lawyer, I'm one of the few in the class who doesn't
                    have an advanced degree, and I was a real oddball.” You know, everybody stands
                    up and says, “I've just finished my masters at SAIS (School of Advanced
                    International Studies), and I've lived overseas and worked in the major banking
                    firm, and I've done this, and I was a lawyer, blah, blah, blah.” Out of 41, we
                    had like 9 lawyers, we had a lot of Peace Corps folks, and you could always sort
                    of find your Peace Corps. You have to identify them. And then I stood up and
                    said, “I used to work in advertising when “Where's the Beef?” was Wendy's
                    campaign.” [Laughter] I thought, “Ah, what the heck! I'm me, and it's a strange
                    fit, but here I am.” But I was so excited about living overseas, and joining the
                    Foreign Service, and State Department. The A-100 class, it was a very wonderful
                    lifestyle for us, because you go to class. You don't go out there and fight to
                    earn a living.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>It was just wonderful, and we had a lot of time with the two little guys, our two
                    sons; and they were just cute as can be. It was a wonderful, sweet time for us.
                    We were meeting these great people in our class, wonderful talented people, many
                    of whom have stayed and had fabulous careers — our closest friends (you know,
                    three or four or five of them). Dan Pacuda has had a great career, and last time
                    I talked to him he was in administrative S/S-EX (Office of the Executive
                    Secretary, Executive Office), working in the transition between Madeleine
                    Albright and Colin Powell, and just a fabulously talented guy. Cindy Wood, who
                    had a long Foreign Service career, and who joined her husband who was in the
                    Foreign Service, and she just finished up in Greece. And Pattie, who had worked
                    in New Jersey like we did, and we went to our first couple of tours and stayed
                    very close, and I'm just blanking on her?Pattie [Patricia] Hanigan Scroggs, who
                    got married, very terrific career, very talented person. Mary Kurtin, who we're
                    very close to. These are people who, you know, just meeting them, we had a lot
                    in common with them. They were all different ages. Dan was a lawyer. Mary was,
                    you know, an American history and political science masters, and she and Richard
                    really loved all that. Patricia and I, we had grown up near each other in New
                    Jersey, and we ended up doing our two overseas assignments together. It was
                    really interesting. We grew up in New Jersey; we came into training together,
                    then went to Mexico together, and then Korea together, and then back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>But it was the training itself I thought was interesting, and like varied, and
                    just fun; and we had a lot of social stuff. We played touch football games and
                    had potluck dinners, and we socialized a lot. It was fun!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well then, in the first place, because we've talked
                        about this before, did you feel oddballish within the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: At being a woman?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I didn't. But I had just come from a highly competitive business
                    environment where all of my bosses, except for one, over seven years —was it
                    seven years?six years I was in advertising — were men; all my clients, except
                    for a couple, were men; towards the end there I had a few women clients. So I
                    was used to dealing with guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And competing with guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And having guys as bosses who were responsible for my salaries, and
                    promotions, and everything else. So this didn't particularly bother me. I didn't
                    feel any - it was not an issue for me. I mean I did have some feeling that for a
                    lot of the Foreign Service guys who were coming in, their wives were going
                    overseas, and they don't have work, and they have to figure out work, and I'm
                    thinking, “What a bad deal that's going to be, and how hard that's going to
                    be.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: On the other hand, I was thinking, “And yet we have these two young kids,
                    and we have to figure this out ourselves.” So there's no at-home person to help
                    with the transition, and the institution at that time really did not take that
                    into account.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: You want to be a tandem, great; but we're not going to do anything to make
                    your family's transition to post any easier. You have your kids, great! It's
                    structured to have an at-home spouse take care of the family's lives. It's not
                    structured to have two officers hit the ground, and it's just not conducive to
                    family life. So I hope that something?you know, I'm out of touch. I haven't been
                    overseas in a number of years on an assignment. But I felt that was a hard
                    thing. But I didn't think it was a woman's thing. I thought it was a family
                    thing. I thought that was hard.</p>
                <p>But soon we were so enthusiastic. We had our swearing in on the Seventh Floor. It
                    was just a very exciting, wonderful time for us. Our one son was in our arms,
                    and our other son was a little baby. Patrick was less than a year old, and
                    Michael was then three. I felt we were doing a great adventure, something good
                    and purposeful, and felt very positive about it. I felt we were going to do
                    really well. We were sure we were going to excel. We were going to do great! It
                    was going to be a great career, and we were going to do it forever, you
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular goal in mind, where you wanted
                        to go, what area, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No. We just wanted to be someplace together with decent jobs, and that's
                    great because that's what the Foreign Service likes, you know. No particular
                    language that we had, so we were pretty flexible. And of course they needed
                    people out there to work in the visa mills, when they first come in the
                    door.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where'd you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: To Mexico City. We were delighted with that. You know, Spanish is a
                    learnable language. At that time I thought, “Yea, I can learn a language, you
                    know.” [Laughter] I didn't realize what a struggle it was. Mexico City was
                    great. We just had no real?we would have gone anywhere. We would have gone to
                    Africa; we would have gone to Asia; it didn't matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd just like to get the beginning of an assignment. You
                        went to Mexico City from '86 to, or was it '87?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes?I'm trying to think when we left to go there. We started in September
                    of '86 -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably '87 then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's when we started FSI. So nine months, is it? I think it's a pretty?is
                    it nine months in those days they did?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's three or four months, I thought. But maybe - I don't
                        know. But then language too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, language too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So probably around?so you were probably mid to late -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Eighty-seven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eighty-seven to when? When did you leave Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was a year and a half, just a short tour, ridiculously short tours,
                    stayed a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Okay. Well then, probably '89ish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, let's?what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Non-immigrant Visa officer. Richard, the real estate lawyer, [laughter] was
                    doing immigrant visa interviews, and we were in two separate sections, but it
                    was a blast. We just loved it, you know! We just, you know, it was fun! It
                    reminded me of my first high school job, working as a checkout girl in a
                    supermarket, because it was fast, and they didn't care what you did as long you
                    did it fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Everyday the line supervisor would list how many decisions were made -
                    visas issued, visas refused. They actually compared officers on the line. It
                    reminded me of my summer job in the paint factory, too (it was get 'em in there;
                    the machine will break down if you do not put these things into the machine
                    holes at the right time). And it was so much fun. There was such a great esprit
                    de corps among the officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find the decision-making, because for
                        some people this turns out to be -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Ridiculous. It was atrocious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?a very difficult thing just to make -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I did not think I was doing work of value. I didn't think it was serious
                    work. It could have been, but it wasn't when you were being asked to make these
                    decisions in?under 60 seconds, I'm sure. We would go out to the barn in Mexico
                    City. If you've done consular work, you know what that's like; and it was the
                    waiting area that they built like a giant Quonset hut to shield people from the
                    sun. This one fellow officer, Michael Scown, who was a big lawyer, really fun
                    guy from San Francisco, [and I] would go out to the barn because we were the
                    fastest; and we would go up and down the aisles and make ridiculous decisions
                    based on whether somebody looked clean or not; and we would just like pluck out
                    the ones we knew were never coming back to Mexico, were clearly going for work
                    or whatever in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>LOAR: But I also felt very torn because I started thinking, “Well, wait a minute!
                    My grandparents were immigrants. I have to treat these people fairly.” But my
                    job was to carry out the immigration law, which was riddled with
                    inconsistencies. We'd get these ridiculous CODELS (Congressional Delegations)
                    all the time asking us to ignore the immigration law. So I didn't feel it was
                    particularly valuable and important work, and I didn't think anybody cared how
                    it was done as long as it was done fast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it wasn't like eating me up. I wasn't struggling with it. We had such a
                    fabulous, fun group of officers, who had come from all different parts, all
                    different backgrounds, all different ages. We had like 20 JOs (Junior Officers),
                    that it was really great fun to work. Richard had more serious work. In the
                    Immigrant Visa case, you get to interview the person, and he would be done with
                    his work at 11:30 in the morning, and then he was like, “Okay, now what?” We
                    were done when there were no more people standing; and there were always people
                    standing, always. I would joke that I really got into Mexican Coca-Cola in the
                    green bottles because I needed to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, and I didn't drink
                    coffee, and I would just chug those cokes back. But we would go through the
                    lines and just pick out, okay, who's has nits, bugs in their hair, who has dirty
                    feet? Send them outside. The others you go in for an interview. You just do the
                    triage out in the barn of cutting out who was not going to ever - and sometimes
                    it got to the point where, don't even send them in. Make the decision out there!
                    So it really became ten seconds, fifteen seconds. You're just sizing somebody
                    up!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well did you find that visa brokers were hiring suits and
                        getting haircuts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, yes. On the Immigrant Visa side Richard had some serious cases. He had
                    to do a thoughtful, deliberative case, case-by-case things. Immigrant visas are
                    a lot different than the 90 percent of the people who apply in Mexico City who
                    are going to Disneyland or to visit a distant cousin, because those are the two
                    destinations in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>

                <p>LOAR: If we only had a nickel for every visa we issued for people going to
                    Disneyland. But there wasn't that thoughtful process at all. It was much more of
                    a quickie, quickie deciding, using your language, which I know my language on
                    the visa line was terrible.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>But we had wonderful housing because at that time they had an interesting housing
                    policy in Mexico City, none that I could figure out. We had two kids, and I
                    didn't want it with a lot of stairs because I didn't want my little guy falling
                    down stairs. They found us one place that had quarters for two separate sets of
                    household help, and I thought, “That sounds cool.” And we had an American, this
                    Mormon, young woman down with us, who was the transitional nanny, you know, at
                    costs we found were so much because she had to live with us, you know, in
                    Washington during the training and then come on down to Mexico with us, great
                    person who was willing to help us get settled. We needed an apartment for her.
                    So the landlord took this servant's quarter and turned it into a really nice
                    apartment; and then, of course, when that American nanny left and the Mexican
                    nanny moved in, the landlord was furious. “We would never have fixed that up for
                    a Mexican nanny, and you tricked us!” I said, “No, I didn't.” But the house was
                    really an incredible house, and I couldn't tell how we qualified for this house,
                    but I didn't care! It was fabulous, very close in and great life style, and my
                    son was very close to the little Montessori school.</p>
                <p>But the work was not wearing you out mentally. But it didn't matter, because we
                    were all like, “Well, let's get this done,” and nobody put themselves higher
                    than anybody else. One woman there had seven languages, Daria Fane; another,
                    Bryan Dalton, had seven languages. They were incredible linguists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find one of the complaints sometimes is
                        that, here I am so terribly qualified, and what they made me do? They made
                        me go to Mexico City. We had, you know, letters to the editor and things
                        like I'm -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Of course, and they make it a big deal in Mexico City when people resigned.
                    Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that? Did you feel your skills were
                        always being misused?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, it was ridiculous! The thing was we all were in the same boat; and they
                    were highly qualified people, all of us in the same boat, all of us, you know,
                    in our mid-30s because that was the average age (when I came in, I was 32), mid
                    to late 30s; and we were all having fun, having parties, and doing great
                    things.</p>
                <p>We were all looking for the serious work, and Richard had a chance to do some
                    really good serious work. Roger Gamble was our DCM (Deputy Chief of Mission);
                    and he was terrific, a former marine. I was very lucky. We were very lucky to
                    have Roger as our first boss. Roger really, really managed the junior officers,
                    really reached out to us, really spent time talking with us; because, here we
                    were in the bowels of the embassy with the visa line chief focusing on getting
                    the most out of us that they could.. Roger was just great.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>He pulled Richard up to do some study of how you can predict who a Mexican future
                    political elite is going to be. So Richard did this interesting study looking at
                    people who were identified by the international business program. It was really
                    a great thought piece, you know. But because he was in the Immigrant Visa line
                    and done at 11:30, of course his line chief deeply resented that -</p>

                <p>LOAR: ?did not let him forget that that was inappropriate that he was working
                    outside the section. You're supposed to read catalogs and magazines the rest of
                    the afternoon, the way that she did. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, I was just going to say, you came up against
                        sort of the second level of the consular establishment, which is usually a
                        problem.</hi>

                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                        to go too far, and have learned their technical skills, and sort of resent
                        the young people, or not young, but I mean the bright people coming through
                        and on their way somewhere else; and sometimes that resentment -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, the immediate line supervisor was Gail, I forget her last name, but
                    she was bright, and her job was to get those visas done.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then the one above her had some real problems. I didn't have a problem
                    with him, but some other people did. And then we had the consul general, and
                    this is good for another session, okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Charlie Brown.</p>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>LOAR: He was the supervisor and consul general for all of Mexico and the
                    consulates, and Richard Peterson was the consul general just for Mexico City. If
                    we could stop, I'd sort of like to pick that up, because that's another
                    interesting discussion for next time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well then, we'll stop at this point, and we'll
                        pick it up next time. We've got you in Mexico City. We've talked about your
                        job per se, and your housing, and all. But we'll, now, next time, pick it up
                        talking about your impression of the consular establishment there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 7 November 2001, Theresa, again, you were in
                        Mexico City from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I think from '87 to '88, for a year and a half, or '89, something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, that puts us pretty close. Well, we were
                        just beginning to talk about the consular establishment and your
                        impressions, because I think this is important. For one thing, it's very
                        important for an awful lot of people who are coming up to get visas or get
                        protection from Americans to understand what makes it, and what harms, and
                        what helps, you know, in this. We were talking about some of the people who
                        came in sort of mid-career. But could you talk a bit now about the
                        supervision that you had, and as you saw how it operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was a great challenge, I think, to the consular supervisory team
                    because you had so many people every day who were applying for visas; and you
                    had to train these officers, most of whom were on their first tour in the
                    Foreign Service and many of whom had done significant jobs with responsibility
                    in other fields, but who had come all eager and excited to start their work in
                    the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>You're supposed to implement the immigration law, and you usually had about 30
                    seconds to adjudicate a case, which is a very highfalutin word for looking at
                    somebody and seeing whether they look like they're going to return to their home
                    country or not. Well, I think that the supervisory consular team had a lot of
                    challenges - which is, getting people to work fast and hard, keeping the refusal
                    number high enough that Washington would think we weren't giving away the visas;
                    and trying to keep the process honest, which was challenging when you had so
                    many pressures from neighbors, and friends, and people who might know you, to
                    help them with the visa. There were also a lot of security concerns at that time
                    in Mexico: there was a lot of activity from former Soviet Union Bulgarian
                    diplomats passing through; and from Russians, Cubans, and people of all sorts
                    and stripes looking to come into the United States - so I think it was
                    challenging work.</p>
                <p>I think we had 20 junior officers in Mexico City. Everybody had to rotate through
                    two things. the first of these was the line, the NIV (Non-immigrant Visa) line,
                    which reminded me of my first job working as a cashier in a supermarket which
                    was a lot of fun. There was no heavy lifting, a lot of fun, an emphasis on “do
                    it good, do it fast” with a lot of camaraderie in the group you're working with.
                    We had terrific camaraderie among the officers, who were just a very mixed bag
                    of people: some were out of graduate school, some were experienced linguists,
                    some with a lot of experience within the UN, three or four were lawyers, and my
                    husband Richard and I. It was just a great group to work together with. But I
                    think people uniformly felt their work was not difficult; you were making quick
                    decisions, but you weren't making good decisions a lot of the time. It wasn't
                    really your job to think it through. You'd just look at somebody, size them up
                    as to whether they were coming back, or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did it bother you? Something that later actually
                        came into a court case, I think, was that with this quick look, it's the
                        whole non-immigrant visa process is discriminatory as all hell, because if
                        you're a rich person, you've got something to come back to, and if you're a
                        poor person, you don't have something to come back to. So ipso facto, you're
                        looking at somebody and saying, “Is this person rich? Are you all satisfied?
                        Good.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>LOAR: The immigration law, though, is based on proving, or getting in this
                    30-second interview - maybe 30 seconds - the information and making the
                    impression that you're going to return to your home country. Are you an
                    intending immigrant or not? As we're finding after the tragic events of
                    September 11th, there are other things that need to be considered. But right
                    now, the consular system isn't equipped to do that if the intelligence is not in
                    the system. And I fully support Mary Ryan's testimony before Congress. I follow
                    this closely, especially when there is criticism. How did these people get
                    visas? Well, if you don't know anything derogatory about this person, and you do
                    your computer checks, and it doesn't come up with a hit, there's no reason not
                    to give all those people from Egypt and Saudi Arabia who were involved in the
                    terrorist activities here in the United States a visa. There was nothing in the
                    system to indicate they were bad guys. You see, the whole system is based on,
                    “Are you going to return to your home country?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And these people were people of means. So the intelligence information
                    needs to be fed to the consular people, and there needs to be a lot more
                    intelligence information, so that the consular officers have the information
                    that they need to do their job. I really do feel strongly about that. You cannot
                    blame the United States consular people for letting these people in when there's
                    nothing to indicate they should not be let in. The law is not based on whether
                    you think they might be bad guys or not. If you have no information, and there's
                    no clue, there's nothing to go on. You have to go ahead and give them the
                    visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We're trying. But there have been proposals,
                        supposedly from the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and the CIA
                        (Central Intelligence Agency) not to give any Middle Eastern male between
                        the ages of 18 and 45 a visa, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean highly discriminatory!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. We had so many visa applicants and so many people waiting in line that
                    two of us would be outside to do what I would call the triage - Michael Scown,
                    who was a lawyer out of San Francisco and me. Neither one of us had fabulous
                    language skills, I will say right up front; but we were able to make decisions
                    quickly. So, they put us out in the barn, which was a big room, very hot, with
                    benches where people would filter in. The mariachi bands would be playing right
                    outside; the taco stands were all around it, and we would just walk up and down
                    the rows, and [laughter] I'm reluctant to say this, if somebody's feet were
                    really, really dirty, or if there were bugs clearly on their person, in their
                    hair, or if they just looked like they'd literally just walked out from the
                    fields, we would save them the trouble of going inside. We weeded out an awful
                    lot of people who were encouraged or who had paid somebody money to come stand
                    in line to see if they could get a visa. It was a ridiculous process, utterly
                    ridiculous process.</p>
                <p>Then, after weeding those out, the pressure was, “Well, we don't want that many
                    people coming in for interviews.” So we would do our 15-second interviews out in
                    the barn, and we would stand there and say, “Yes,” “No,” I mean just look at
                    somebody, and [sigh] you know, you'd look at their papers, all the papers, and
                    90 percent of the papers were prepared by the visa handlers outside. They paid
                    money to 'em. I'm glad to hear the United States is finally charging now for
                    visas in some countries, since everyone was making money on the process except
                    the poor U.S. government -</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?which was giving them the right and the privilege to come into the United
                    States. But the papers meant almost nothing, because, unless you could really
                    figure out which were the fake papers and which were the real ones, it was
                    impossible to tell. But it was a very haphazard process, and I don't think it's
                    changed particularly.</p>

                        have people like yourself coming in, and a new crew coming in every few
                        months almost, and doing things that we were trained you shouldn't do. You
                        shouldn't make snap judgments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think we all saw it as the job you do to get through the gate. I
                    was a consular officer, and I took consular work seriously; but I don't think
                    anyone thought this was developing some skill. You did learn how to move people
                    quickly through lines, how to set up secure entry systems; and I think it'd be
                    hard for anyone to say this was something that was skill building, or a training
                    thing that built you for the future of the Foreign Service. It was a need, and
                    they threw bodies at the need, and we were one of the bodies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any of your colleagues were in a way unable
                        to meet this particular test?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, I think some people found it annoying, but we were all ranges of
                    abilities and all kinds of backgrounds, and it was a great leveler. It was what
                    I imagine when you join the military. It's a great leveler no matter where
                    you're from, the old military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: When it wasn't so class divided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So there was somebody next to you in the line who spoke seven languages and
                    was really, really good; and here I was - I could barely handle Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then the person next to me had a different set of experiences, had her
                    master's in international relations, and was really dying to get out there and
                    work in the Soviet Union; and here I come out of advertising. But it didn't
                    matter. I mean we all sort of worked together, and we did different projects and
                    went off and did our prison visits, which was a real fun project. Going off and
                    doing prison visits, you got out into the countryside, and you got to visit
                    American drug dealers in jail for the most part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's move away from the Visa Section. How'd you
                        find the prison visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, it was a very interesting experience. It was scary, because you had to
                    walk into these prisons alone. My husband, Richard, had worked in the Immigrant
                    Visa Section. He had a very different work experience, in that it wasn't a
                    sweatshop sort of quick, quick, quick, quick, quick! It was more: “Here's your
                    cases for the day. Look at them, blah, blah, blah.” Those were the scheduled
                    appointments; and he had people like the Shah of Iran's brother, who wanted to
                    set up a pistachio business, which is a little different from the clientele I
                    was seeing. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>LOAR: But when he was done, then he had free time to do other projects. So he
                    went off and did well. He was recruited by the DCM, Roger Gamble, who was
                    terrific. Roger Gamble was a great DCM; a former marine who loved the Foreign
                    Service and really ran the embassy. Of course, our ambassador at the time,
                    Pilliod [Charles J. Pilliod, Jr.] only kind of lived in Mexico - he didn't quite
                    live there and wasn't really connected to the team at the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But Roger really ran it, and he was just terrific. He and his wife were
                    lovely. They would invite junior officers out to their place and you'd get to
                    know them. He would invite the junior officers to receptions. He really treated
                    all the junior officer team as serious officers, not as the people in the lower
                    echelons of the embassy working [laughter] to decide who was in or who has fewer
                    bugs in their hair than the other one.</p>
                <p>So Richard would be recruited by Roger to do some different projects and reports.
                    I felt that was interesting and glad he had a chance to do it, but I remember
                    thinking, “Gee, that would be fun.”</p>
                <p>But as consular officers, we were called upon to go out and do these prison
                    visits. You couldn't do it when you were on visa line duty, because you
                    [laughter] literally couldn't leave your work area. That was really different
                    from the supermarket, in that at the supermarket I had a union, and at 16 years
                    of age I had more flexibility. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I had an older sibling working at the supermarket with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But everybody was good-natured about it. We really did have all kinds of
                    personalities.</p>
                <p>But the prison visits were an interesting thing, and I do think Americans who are
                    arrested overseas do need to be visited in prison. I think the program in Mexico
                    was particularly stringent, and the U.S. Congress was very concerned about the
                    prisons. I remember visiting a young woman who was probably in her early or late
                    20s, or so, who was a mule, and just carried some drugs for her boyfriend, and
                    who was in this one prison for a very long time. She was getting out soon. She
                    was obviously extremely concerned about what it would be like to be out of
                    prison. But walking into the prison alone was not part of my life
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>I remember one time I went someplace in the middle of a coffee plantation just
                    south of Mexico - I think this was it. An embassy driver was with me, a
                    wonderful guy; and he said, “Would you like me to walk in with you?” and I said,
                    “Yes, I would very, very much like that! Thank you for asking me that
                    question!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And it really did make me feel a lot more comfortable that he would do that
                    and wait at a particular place; and they knew he was waiting. I don't know what
                    I expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: You know, I don't have a lot of experience with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find the prison authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, there are two prison visits that come to mind. One was visiting this
                    one guy who was a former Assembly of God missionary, and who grew up as a
                    missionary in a big family of missionaries. Then somewhere along the line he had
                    crossed to the other side of the street and had became a major drug dealer, and
                    had used his intimate knowledge of the transportation systems, and distribution
                    routes, and where to find the product to become a big-time drug dealer. He was
                    arrested, and he was now living in this prison in a very remote area. He seemed
                    to be pretty much running the prison. There were drugs everywhere. So that made
                    me even more nervous, because you didn't know who the authorities were
                    [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>LOAR: Part of our services to him was to make sure he got his Social Security
                    check delivered, so that his Mexican wife — who was living, I don't think in the
                    prison, but in the prison town — could get the full benefits, which was another
                    eye-opener to me [laughter]. I didn't know you could be convicted, and, while
                    serving time in a Mexican jail, get your Social Security check, and be able to
                    support your new family. But he was one of the more colorful people. I did say I
                    was scared as hell when I was in there. But what he pretty much said was that he
                    apparently had some ongoing relationship with people who sold drugs, so he had a
                    lot of power in the prison. You would think he was a missionary with his long
                    beard. He talked about how the heavy drug use calmed everybody down and kept
                    them sedated, and how the men were able to bring women in — their girlfriends,
                    or wives at the moment, or whatever we would like to call those who provided
                    those services — and so there was not a great deal of sexual tension or sexual
                    violence that there is in American prisons; that was very interesting. So, drugs
                    and conjugal visits were kind of an accepted norm.</p>
                <p>And my interest was really: is this American getting the full range of services
                    he's supposed to get as an American overseas prisoner; is he being treated okay?
                    He clearly was the dominant personality in the prison. And, yes, he seemed to be
                    doing just fine [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And when his social security check was delivered, he would request specific
                    chocolates from a particular city - I think See's Chocolates from San Francisco,
                    California - and we would do what we could to help him. That was an interesting
                    experience. I remember the hotel I was staying in had little geckos all over the
                    walls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Little.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Little -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Ugly things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They eat the other insects that are around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I am glad to see them there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes [laughter]!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Because there weren't other ones! And, I can't remember what city it was in
                    the South. It was just unbelievable.</p>
                <p>And then this other prison visit I remember. It must have been outside of Mexico
                    City, which is why the driver was with me; and that was scary. It was just so
                    sad to hear this story of this young woman from the Bronx who carried drugs for
                    her boyfriend, and ended up paying such a heavy, heavy price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, is one of the great tragedies, because
                        there are people, and elderly people also, who were used as mules.</hi>

                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was her boyfriend still around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No. I don't think he ever even got caught.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I do remember Colin Cleary, who was a really terrific Foreign Service
                    officer, and his wife, now Susan Cleary. They're both in the Foreign Service
                    together, and they both have red hair. They have three redheaded kids. They look
                    like a GAP ad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They're just a great couple and wonderful talented people. Well, Colin did
                    a report. We were all looking for substance, something we could get our teeth
                    into, because we were doing these 30-second visa interviews - cheerfully
                    [laughter] -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?seeing who had the most numbers, and socializing a lot, and enjoying each
                    other's company, but looking for substance.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>He wrote a very long, detailed report about a Mexican drug lord who was in
                    prison. It was about where he was in prison in Mexico City, and what his
                    arrangements were. Colin would ask questions, and they would tell him. “Well,
                    how does this guy get food? Well, how does he run his operation? How does he get
                    visits from women? How does this all happen?” I do not remember the name of the
                    Mexican drug lord, but it was let's say, '8'89. He was the preeminent Mexican
                    drug lord, and he was in a prison in Mexico City and living the good life. Colin
                    wrote this really long cable detailing it. But, it was not cleared to leave the
                    embassy, because that would be bad information for Congress to know that Mexican
                    drug lords were living the good life and running their operations out of a
                    Mexican prison. I'm not sure who made that decision, but I remember Colin being
                    very frustrated, because it was well researched.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was like a reporter had written it, backed up by more than one source;
                    it was very clear information. But it was deemed by someone in the embassy as
                    bad information to come out of Mexico because then Congress would beat up on
                    Mexico, and we didn't want that to happen, and “That stuff happens overseas
                    sometimes.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. Well, of course, there is this problem (I run
                        across this in a lot of other of these interviews, and I know I've
                        experienced it myself), that it's great to report on corruption, but when
                        the corruption gets filtered out to Congress, it ends up in absolutely
                        negative reactions when there are other things going on; and so do you
                        report as a reporter does, and then can walk away from the repercussions of
                        this? Or, you get your jollies, and you report it, and then, what does it
                        mean?</hi>

                <p>Well, where else did you serve in Mexico? What else did you do?</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, after my time on the NIV line, there was a position as an aide to the
                    supervisory consul general. I was selected for that, which was a lot of fun
                    because I got to work up in the office with the consul general, [Richard] Dick
                    Peterson and Charlie Brown, who was the supervisory consul general. I don't
                    remember all the things I did. I do remember that I set up a rotation schedule
                    for junior officers when they came in so that they had some idea of what to
                    expect from their tour. They didn't know if they were going to work on the visa
                    line until they dropped, or if they were ever going to get a chance to do prison
                    visits, or if they would ever get a chance to do citizen services, which was a
                    cushy job and interesting. It gave you some chance to do things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But we also were thinking (and I don't remember how this started) of
                    rotating junior officers from the different consulates, because the supervisory
                    consul general was also in charge of the final rating officer and reviewing
                    officer for all the junior officers at all the posts all over Mexico. So I got
                    to know all those officers, and that was really a lot of fun because there was
                    so much talent out there! Patricia Hanigan, who's now Patricia Hanigan Scroggs,
                    was a star. She was a fabulous junior officer out in a place whose name I forget
                    [Mazatl�n, Mexico].</p>
                <p>So we set up a rotation of junior officers. I don't remember if this started with
                    me, or if this had gone on before. It was a wonderful program of rotating junior
                    officers in from the consulates into Mexico City, and then sending out the
                    junior officers from Mexico City out to the consulates for two weeks at a time.
                    I know the junior officers in Mexico City; thought it was great because you got
                    to get off of the visa line to see what it was like in a consulate, which was
                    completely different. And the JOs, who were in the middle of a consulate and
                    bored to death because they had maybe 20 visa applicants a day, rather than 20
                    applicants in 15 minutes, were thrilled to come to a big city and to see what it
                    was like inside of an embassy. So, it was a very good program. I'm sure it had
                    gone on before. I enjoyed organizing that and getting that going and getting
                    people to come in and out. I also enjoyed meeting all the officers from the
                    other posts.</p>
                <p>The other thing has to do with junior officers' EERs (Employee Evaluation
                    Reports) - the personnel reports from the junior officers at post. Charlie
                    Brown, as the supervisory consul general, had to write the reviewing statement.
                    We had to look over those. That was something we took pretty seriously, because
                    in some posts there were less than fabulous supervisors who were less than fair
                    to some of the junior officers, and it's so important that your first reports
                    were done right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Oh, absolutely!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>LOAR: So I played a little bit of an advocates role in looking out to make sure
                    people's reports were fairly done. I got involved in that part of it: I think
                    Charlie wanted to be fair as well. He knew who the problem people out in the
                    field were and who the problem supervisors were. We would go back with drafts
                    that were more appropriate, given what people had done, and what they had
                    contributed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things I was wondering was whether you
                        were able to take a look at the Foreign Service, or consular work
                        particularly. It's not everybody's cup of tea, and some people really can't
                        rise to the occasion, as the fit isn't right. There's nothing wrong with
                        them, they may be brilliant, but they were like a fish out of water. Did you
                        run across that when you were looking at this rather large mass of junior
                        officers? Were you, yourself, seeing, just as a reviewer, problems like
                        that? I mean people who were a little out of place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There were some who were out of place. But one thing I learned in the time
                    in the Foreign Service - and I learned this from one of my favorite bosses,
                    Kathy Cahir, who was a consular officer, and had risen very high, and was one of
                    the best managers I've ever come across - is that there's a whole different set
                    of skills that are needed. You have people who can write cables well, people who
                    can argue a point well, people who can figure out an economic table and read
                    that well, and people who can represent U.S. interests. There's such a broad
                    range. There were a couple of people who were odd fits. Some felt they were
                    above it; and frankly, that was annoying to me because this is what you do. You
                    come in, you do this job, and you move on to something else and you build
                    relationships that help you in your future job, and you make your contribution,
                    and you pay your dues. There were a number of people who had really significant
                    high-level skills and had done very important highly compensated jobs, and they
                    were not really the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was the people who had the perception that they were in that category.
                    The perception and the reality didn't always match.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There was such camaraderie among us, even though we were such a disparate
                    group, an odd group. You would never put these people together and say, “Well,
                    here's a group that can form together as a team and support each other,” but it
                    really was the case. I'm trying to think if there were people who stood out
                    because they didn't work as a team and didn't support each other, because these
                    were not good jobs, you know. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They weren't good jobs! I'm trying to think if there were some who really
                    stood out. There was someone who did have some mental health issues, and
                    suffered a breakdown, and left post. Everybody saw that coming and felt bad
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I'm trying to remember if there were others who weren't quite up to the job
                    of doing things quickly, and for whom that was a challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, as you mentioned before, it's like the military
                        basic training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. They just strip down to: “Can you talk to people quickly?” This was
                    the NIV Section. The Immigrant Visa Section was different; they had very
                    different challenges. They had supervisory challenges there that were on a whole
                    other level.</p>
                <p>We had, I think, a good supervisory team on the NIV side and people who, for the
                    most part, wanted to get the job done; and I wouldn't have done it exactly the
                    same way; perhaps somebody else would do it differently. But we socialized with
                    the boss team [laughter]. One of the things I think about it is those are
                    friendships you built there. Richard and I are so close to the people we served
                    with in the Consular Section in Mexico City because we were all in the same
                    boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well then, did you both leave Mexico at the same
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We did, yes; which reminds me of one interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: One time I was on duty in the NIV Section because in our lowly status you
                    didn't have lunch free five days a week. You had to rotate lunch duty. One
                    person had to cover the phones and be there in case something happened during
                    those 35 minutes that you were allowed, or 40 minutes, to consume your lunch
                    [laughter].</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>And I just must say something about the taquito stand behind the embassy. I still
                    think those were the best fresh taquitos I've ever had. I'm still looking to
                    replace those in my journeys around the world.</p>
                <p>One day, on lunch duty, I got a call from a man who identified himself as a
                    Nicaraguan diplomat and said he wanted to defect to the United States. Now, my
                    immediate reaction was somebody who wanted to jump the line. You know, “I can
                    understand that pal. I would want to jump the line too!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, me too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: “What baloney!”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, no, no, no!”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, come to the front door.” I mean, you know, it was lunch duty. It's
                    what I was supposed to be doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It occurred about the time when the Sandinistas were
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Right. Did I mention this in this history before?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, no, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just putting it in context.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No, no. That's it exactly. So he said, “I won't come to the front gate
                    because I know there's cameras there.”</p>
                <p>I thought, “Okay. This is somebody who's on the ball. This is a clever line
                    jumper.” I said, “Okay, I'll come to the side gate.” So I had a Foreign Service
                    National come with me, because I didn't want to go to the side door and let
                    somebody in without some other person there with me.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>This person comes in, is shaking like a leaf, has a military uniform on, has an
                    official passport, has who appears to be his wife with him; and they're both
                    shaking like crazy. I realized that this was probably something serious and
                    talked to them a little bit. I felt bad for them because they were so nervous
                    and so anxious. I said to them, “You wanted to talk about defecting.” Then I
                    said, “Tell me what your thoughts are.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, I've been trying to approach the embassy for days, and days, and
                    days, and days; and I've not been able to get in; and this is what I want. I'm
                    only here for a few days. If I don't have these conversations with the right
                    people soon, my opportunity will be lost. I am the top aide to Humberto Ortega
                    at the defense ministry in Nicaragua, and I don't like what they're doing, and I
                    know where their secret bank accounts are, and I know how they betrayed the
                    revolution and the people.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, what are you doing here in Mexico City to start with?” I was
                    trying to figure out who sent him, and how he was set up and what this whole
                    thing was.</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, I'm here for medical treatment, and I always come to Mexico
                    City for medical treatment. It's a wound from before my Sandinista days, in
                    another revolutionary battle.” And you know, he seemed very sincere.</p>
                <p>So I took the passport and called members of the Embassy staff, and they came
                    down and interviewed him behind closed doors. I kept calling back upstairs, and
                    they were very excited because this was a real live person who had real live
                    information, and it was a sincere defection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I should just back up a little bit to say that as part of our training on
                    the NIV line and the Immigrant Visa line, we all got to know people upstairs who
                    were working for the station; and part of it was to look for people from
                    Bulgaria who were going to the United States and were going to be stopping at
                    the border and how we could coordinate with different intelligence communities
                    so the intelligence community knew what these “not friends of the U.S.” were
                    doing as they were coming in and out of the United States. So we knew whom to
                    call. We knew the station chief, who was very sociable and invited people up and
                    really got to know the consular officers, so that they could be assets and
                    helpful in intelligence gathering, which I thought was consistent with our job
                    because we're supposed to represent U.S. interests. I think most people felt
                    that way. It was more interesting than some of the other things we were
                    doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>So, when this fellow presented the passport, it took awhile to get somebody to
                    come down because they were all on lunch. But I knew this guy was really
                    shaking. I was really afraid he was going to leave so I had an FSN (Foreign
                    Service National) keep me company/guard him and not let him leave. But it was
                    right next to the door. He was so shaky! I was just so afraid he was going to
                    leave after I started to think, “Maybe he really is legitimate.” It took a while
                    just calling up anybody I knew up there. They came down and determined that he
                    was legitimate and bona fide, and decided then to continue their conversations
                    with him. I felt good, and thought, “Go ahead and do that. This is my job,
                    that's yours! [Laughter] You go and do that.”</p>
                <p>It turned out that they did bring him to the United States. At that time the
                    Mexican government was quite friendly with the Sandinistas. We did not want the
                    Mexican government to know that this guy had defected to us, and we had him in
                    Mexico. So they got him out and got him to the United States.</p>
                <p>I was told that this is highly classified, and we weren't going to talk to
                    anybody about it. My father was a staunch anti-communist and really didn't like
                    the Sandinistas, and I was dying to tell my father [laughter]! It was so
                    difficult not to call my dad and tell him, “Dad, you're not going to believe
                    what I did! You're not going to believe what happened! This guy came in, blah,
                    blah, blah.”</p>
                <p>We knew that he got out of the country. A couple weeks later - maybe a month
                    later - Judge Webster [William H. Webster], who directed the CIA came to town.
                    We didn't even know that this is happening. I was invited to come up and talk to
                    the station chief again. I thought, “Well, you know, maybe there's some other
                    thing related to this.” But Judge Webster was there, and he presented me with an
                    award for my work in bringing in this defector, and it was a great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was really wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was really a neat, neat moment. He talked about how they got the Walkers
                    - the father and son who had spied against the United States. They were Navy
                    people. How that came about was ... I think Walker's disgruntled ex-wife called
                    drunk one night, trying to get the FBI to pay attention, and after several
                    attempts somebody did. That's how they were able to do it. He compared it to
                    that; it was just a really wonderful thing.</p>
                <p>My view was: what a great opportunity to be able to help someone who has
                    information that could be helpful to U.S. interests. Now, I wasn't the biggest
                    fan of what the U.S. was doing with relation to the Sandinistas and with
                    relation to our covert activities. But I was never a big fan of the Sandinistas
                    either. So I thought it was important that we'd be able to bring some new
                    information to light.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The fellow who defected was Roger Miranda, and he stayed undercover for a long
                    time. Then, they pulled him out and made him public when there was some key vote
                    in Congress on whether to continue to provide funding against the Sandinistas to
                    undermine their government. He was a key witness and gave key testimony; he was
                    listed in an article in Newsweek; I think he got the largest resettlement
                    package of any defector. It was very interesting to have experienced this
                    overall.</p>
                <p>But I always told that story to other junior officers to say, “The lowest, lowest
                    job has its rewards if you do it right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And if I hadn't listened to this guy, hadn't been polite enough, frankly,
                    to listen to him, and let him in, and make him feel comfortable, he would not
                    have come in to the embassy then. He may never have, or he may have come in at
                    some other time - maybe or maybe not. But the lowest, lowest job, if you do it
                    right, has value and importance. I do believe that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, this is very important. I've seen this. I've
                        served in a number of countries where defection is something, and one of the
                        things I find is that this is one reason why it is very handy to have
                        well-educated vice consuls, even if you only use him/her for a while for
                        their brains. It takes things out of the routine, every now and then. I
                        think some people tend to dismiss the obvious signs. This is true with a lot
                        of intelligence activities, because, as you know, it's always the problem of
                        getting past the clerk on the phone, or the doorman; if you have somebody
                        who's intelligent there, they can do something about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, it was just an interesting experience; and, after it was in the
                    newspaper and in the public, I could tell my dad! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Which he got a kick out of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '89 did you and your husband take off
                        somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. I'm just thinking if there are any other highlights of Mexico?we left
                    Mexico?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you remember anything else, we can talk about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, actually my rotation as a junior officer to one of the consulates was
                    to M�rida in the Yucatan, and that was a really fabulous experience -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I learned a lot about life in a small post and realized that anybody would
                    talk to me. I was interviewing all these political candidates, including some
                    women who were running for office, and I thought: “Wow! You mean you're going to
                    talk to me, little lowly vice consul, who in the embassy can, you know, barely
                    make it up to the floor where the ambassador sits?” It was such a great program,
                    and I hope they continued it. It was a little disruptive to supervisors, but
                    great for the junior officers. The smart people who ran those consulates
                    recognized this was a chance to build friends in the embassy, and to find out
                    who the talent is for future assignments, and all of that.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting time, and the consul general there was Bryant Salter,
                    who was a former Redskins football player. I don't remember the position
                    [defensive back], maybe is there a cornerback??</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: No? If that's a position, then I think that's what he did.</p>
                <p>I was reporting. I had never written political reports before, and these weren't
                    classified or anything, but I was interviewing people, getting their views, so I
                    was very nervous about doing it. I was told by Roger Gamble, our DCM, that “I
                    want a steady stream of political reporting,” and I thought: “Well then, you
                    probably have the wrong person, because don't know how to do that!”
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But he pulled me in by saying something like: “I want to see a steady
                    stream of political reporting now, and I want you to do it, and I expect that to
                    happen correctly!” [Laughter] Well, I need say this just for some background. I
                    was very, very nervous about it. I did some writing, and I would review it with
                    Richard over the phone, because Richard had done this in a post; I didn't know
                    what I was doing and he would help me with this. And that kind of gave me the
                    confidence to think, “Well, you know, of course he was helping me, but I've
                    actually had reports coming in, my own cables, out of this post.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I wouldn't have been able to do it, I think. I didn't know how to even
                    start the cable. We had no experience on writing a cable, other than advisories
                    back to Washington on a bad visa guy. It was so, so valuable, and of course, I
                    had someone helping me, Richard, write the cables, which was very kind.</p>
                <p>But it was fascinating what was going on in M�rida. There was so much. Their
                    political activity was so different; there were Cuban posts there, and there was
                    heavy drug activity. I was able to do a series of cables, and get them to
                    Washington, and get them to posts. They were concerned because they were not
                    getting a lot of information out of posts at the time. They were concerned about
                    that. So it was a really wonderful opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the short time you were there, did you see a different
                        part of Mexico? Was there a different feeling, or much more of a local
                        ambiance, or local political ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was Mayan. I think it was the PAN political party (National Action
                    Party), so it was not the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party). It was a
                    different group to start with and very disconnected. This is where the
                    Zapatistas - is that what they are? They are the ones who are armed, and masked,
                    and fighting the government, and representing indigenous groups. But at that
                    time, they were not active in the region.</p>
                <p>It is an area that was so close to Cuba; and not far from Guatemala. These are
                    Mayans; and they're a very different ethnic group; not the indigenous group in
                    Mexico City. It was a completely different experience and very different
                    politically.</p>
                <p>It was a small town, but also great intrigue, you know. What is the U.S. doing?
                    Who are they talking to? Who are they paying attention to? And I did have a
                    chance to interview some high-level women politicians. It was fascinating to me
                    that these women were, first of all, willing to talk to me, a lowly consul, but
                    also that they saw themselves as capable of being out there in the game and
                    running in the political life of Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in view of your later career, including where you
                        are today, did you find yourself looking at women as a political means?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>LOAR: It wasn't me that was doing this. She had put herself out there, and we
                    were just reporting it; and I think if someone else were there, they probably
                    would have interviewed her as well. But I felt comfortable doing it because I
                    thought she'd be more likely to say yes to talking to me than maybe the male
                    candidate. Then, after I made some progress with her, I talked to the male
                    candidate as well. It was just an interesting eye-opener for me, in that Embassy
                    Mexico and the State Department in Washington didn't really know much about
                    these people, and didn't know much about her. I don't remember her name or where
                    she went in the future. It was just an eye-opener that someone with whatever her
                    background was could run for political office, and could get in there, and roll
                    up her sleeves, and compete with the big boys. For the rest of my time there I
                    followed her to see what happened with her; it was very interesting to stay in
                    touch.</p>
                <p>The other project we had out of Mexico City was the special agricultural work
                    project, which was something, in my view, written into the immigration law to
                    help the American growers have a steady supply of people who could work in the
                    agricultural area; it was largely bogus. We did not have people who could handle
                    the workloads. We had to get a lot of help from Washington. So that's why I made
                    some friends in the Consular Affairs Office in Washington. Suddenly this law was
                    passed, and we had representatives of the growers in the embassy ready to
                    interview people and to decide who should get the visas. They stayed on as
                    consultants.</p>
                <p>And how do you know if someone worked? The program required that people had to
                    prove that they had worked in a particular agricultural area before, and to be
                    allowed to come to the United States possibly for longer-term immigration
                    benefits (I don't remember that part of it). But we had to find out who had
                    worked in mushrooms. So what do you do if you work in mushrooms? We had to get
                    in basic checklists. If you had picked strawberries, what were the likely series
                    of questions you would ask somebody who had worked picking strawberries? And the
                    ones who helped us design these questionnaires were the growers'
                    representatives. So it was a very, very interesting process.</p>
                <p>But they also at that time got to work with the church groups, the Catholic
                    Church social justice groups. I think it was Caritas (Catholic Relief Services)
                    whom I've stayed in touch with over the years. They were very interested in
                    making sure these workers weren't getting screwed, and the ones who were
                    qualified would get their benefits. So, then, the church social justice groups
                    and the growers both wanted these workers up in the United States. So there was
                    a lot of pushing and coaching: “Okay. You look like you could pick strawberries
                    because you have the cuts on your hands to show it. It was really a strange
                    program. There was tremendous pressure from Washington, from the California
                    growers, and from the church groups to get these people credentialed up and get
                    them up there. And I know we need agricultural workers in the United States.
                    There is discussion about how to do that now.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>One of my duties was to help manage that and get the help we needed for the
                    program. That's because I was up in the consul general's office as an aide and
                    one of the responsibilities I had was to make sure we had the administrative
                    support to ensure the program was successful. It wasn't the usual Foreign
                    Service officers who did it, because they still had full-time responsibilities.
                    It was a special program and we hired spouses, some of who were excellent, and
                    terrific, and could really break through and figure things out. But, sitting
                    right next to them was a representative of the growers. Then the Catholic groups
                    would come in and try to get my ear. I was very sympathetic and wanted to know
                    what Caritas was, what they were doing and how they were representing the
                    interests of these workers? I was also interested in what the lives for these
                    people when they were up there but not in the fields were like? It was a very
                    interesting, eye-opening experience for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great! Well then, in '89, where? Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We left to go to Korea. Richard by then was ready to bear a political
                    position because he had paid his consular dues. We were looking for two
                    assignments in a big embassy, and we did not want to be studying language.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was easier for me to get a consular assignment almost anywhere since I
                    was consular cone. We needed a slot that sort of worked for Richard, and the two
                    of us could work together. So he got this job as political military affairs
                    officer in Seoul, and I got another consular position. We left there and showed
                    up in Seoul a few months later.</p>

                <p>LOAR: Well, you know, we got some area studies, which was really interesting.
                    Living in Asia we thought would be a great experience, a great opportunity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I came in and I knew that I'd come and do another job now, blah, blah,
                    blah. But I had a really interesting first tour. First of all, I did the NIV
                    work. But then I worked as the supervisory consul general's aide, which was very
                    different, and gave me a lot of chances to do a lot of different things; and it
                    was, frankly, a very good deal.</p>
                <p>So I went to Korea. It was, okay, you're going to go into this section, and there
                    was no program to rotate the junior officers, no schedule. So I went into the
                    consul general and said, “Why don't I do a schedule that will allow officers to
                    come in and know what they can expect?” “Great!” And then, of course, I had done
                    my time in NIV, so I did not schedule myself for the NIV Section [laughter],
                    because I thought: “If I'm going to be trained in how to do full consular work,
                    it'd be good to work in Immigrant Visas for a while, and I'd like to work in
                    American Citizen Services.”</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>I just don't remember the reaction to that, but they didn't have any kind of
                    clear way for people to rotate and get a variety of experiences; and a second
                    tour officer was treated exactly like a first tour officer; and that bothered
                    me, because here was Richard and my good friend Patricia Hanigan from Mexico
                    City. So there were three of us who were on the same track, had started in the
                    same class, had gone to our first posts in the same country together, over here
                    now. Here is Patricia Hanigan, really brilliant, wonderful officer in the Econ
                    (Economic) Section, with an office and a secretary; and here is Richard in the
                    Political Section with an office; and here I am, just starting at the very
                    bottom again, with no sense of what my tour was going to be like and what my
                    responsibilities would be! So I decided to help shape that. Sometimes that was
                    well received, and sometimes it wasn't. But I had nothing to lose because this
                    is my job and this is what I'm going to spend my time doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Ultimately, I would just say it was one of the lightest. I worked in the
                    Immigrant Visa Section with Kathy Cahir, who, as I said before, was one of the
                    best managers I've come across in any of my work experiences, but also a great
                    human being. Kathy Cahir brings out the best in everybody. She values what
                    people bring to the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Her position was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She was the head of the Immigrant Visa Section. Now in Seoul, you know,
                    that's a huge job, and it was a lot of work with the military and their spouses,
                    and “their spouses they wanted to bring over to the United States.” [Laughter]
                    Some of “those spouses” were older than their mother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: See! That was a hard thing too, because you knew this was not legit
                    (legitimate). You knew it carrying out these things. But it was not encouraged
                    that you explore that deeply. If this guy says he wants to bring in this woman
                    who's older than his mother, and that she's going to be his wife, this is what
                    we do. If he says it, this is it. And that was a little discouraging.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that I had a nephew who was adopted from Korea. So I asked to
                    work on the immigrant visas for all the Korean adoptions, and I spent a lot of
                    time getting to know that system and getting to ultimately respect how they did
                    it; and there was some reporting to Washington on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, let's talk a bit about the line. First of all,
                        talk about the line immigrant thing. When I was there I was concerned that
                        there might be fraud.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Just perhaps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had never been a real fraud investigation. So I went
                        to Barbara Watson at a conference, and I said, “Barbara, I think we may have
                        a problem. There's a lot of smoke, and I'd like somebody to come out because
                        our security officer wasn't very interested in this.” So she yanked out the
                        old security officer, transferred him, and brought in a new hot shot, who
                        was very good, Ed Lee, who came in and uncovered a big fraud; and most of
                        the section got fired. Well, while we were doing this, I didn't know that a
                        whole new fraud system was starting in fake petitions. It started just about
                        the time we got rid of the old one. [Laughter] This is ten years
                        before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What documentation and problems with regular line visa cases did you find?</p>
                <p>LOAR: I loved the cases where they'd bring siblings over, because you know,
                    sometimes the wait was 15 to 20 years. So their siblings had gone over and
                    petitioned for them because the line, the numbers, were so slow that it took a
                    good 15 or 20 years to be able to go over there.</p>
                <p>So you could really look back, and you would see pictures of the Koreans who were
                    in Japanese military dress, and who had their names changed from Korean names to
                    Japanese names. You really got a sense of what life was like for the Koreans
                    living under the domination of the Japanese. There were really interesting,
                    heartfelt stories. You'd ask, “Why did you get married so young?”, particularly
                    of the girls.</p>
                <p>The Foreign Service National team at the embassy in Korea, as you know, is very
                    highly educated -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?very motivated. The Immigrant Visa team were almost all women. There were
                    a few men. They have individual teams. It was extremely hierarchical, usually
                    headed by an older woman who was past 50. The others were more recent graduates
                    of Ewha University or the other prestigious universities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>LOAR: They had excellent English, were very well mannered, very polite, very well
                    dressed. Some of them took better vacations than I was taking. Very motivated,
                    very professional, always on time. One of the things that I valued was that they
                    would give me background information. I would say, “Why did this girl get
                    married so young? In Korea you don't, you didn't get married that young.” And
                    they said, “Well, as soon as the girl reached puberty or any part of her
                    sexuality was developing, or she was going through puberty, they married her off
                    to someone in the village immediately, so that when the Japanese came, it was
                    less likely that they would take that girl away and put her into sexual slavery
                    for the purpose of the Japanese camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Called the “comfort women,” yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, which is ultimately what they called that. And that was just
                    shocking to me, what that meant for these girls, who were barely teenagers,
                    because it wasn't a part of the natural culture to be married that young. And
                    then to have the older woman who would say, “There's feelings about the
                    Japanese.” I guess it was a woman in her late 50s, and they were talking about
                    what it was like living under the Japanese, and how in their vocabulary they had
                    several names for Japanese men, and they were all insulting. So you would tie
                    your shoe like a Japanese man, you would go to the bathroom like a Japanese man,
                    you would make love like a Japanese man, you would eat like a Japanese man, and
                    every one of those was an insult!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And we can laugh about it, but their feelings were so, so deep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it all helped in doing the job, you know, and understanding why
                    somebody would be posing in the picture with a Japanese military uniform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Why their name was changed? Would you be suspicious of them? Why I went
                    from a Korean name to a Japanese name to a Korean name again? And there was, I'm
                    sure, a lot of fraudulence. But I think in our section there was such a high
                    standard of pride in the work, especially among the Foreign Service Nationals.
                    They wanted the officers to understand when these people came in and presented
                    themselves.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I think there was a lot of fraud among the young military enlisted men bringing
                    over wives - tremendous fraud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Utterly frustrating to me to have to ignore the fraud, but it was not
                    something that I was allowed to look into. I remember once talking about it, and
                    how I was going to do “this,” and that was highly, highly discouraged. If an
                    American decides he wants to bring this person over, whatever arrangement he has
                    made, financial or otherwise, that's what he's going to do; and that's it, and
                    we just move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd better explain for the record why there would be
                        this fraud. What was in it for everybody. I mean this marrying your
                        grandmother or the equivalent? [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, Korea was just going through an opening. It wasn't a thoroughly
                    flourishing democracy as it's on its way to being now, and there were so many
                    restrictions on the Koreans. There was a big, big opening either right before we
                    got there, which was when the Olympics, the Korean Olympics were. The Seoul
                    Olympics, when were you there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: After that there was a gigantic opening to the outside world -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?where Korea then had visitors from all over the world come and look at
                    Korea, and to understand what was going on there. For the first time, people of
                    my age, and younger and their parents who never had this opportunity, had
                    permission from the government to have passports to travel overseas. So there
                    was a gigantic explosion of people wanting to and being able to travel outside
                    their country. But there was still, you know, economic hardship for many, many
                    people in Korea -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>LOAR: ?and for a lot of women who attached themselves to the military bases and
                    made their living in prostitution. At some point, if someone became too old to
                    make their living in prostitution, then they became somebody who was a madam or
                    managed the prostitution services. And then when they were too old for that,
                    they would then marry an American soldier and come to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And that part of it just got pretty tiresome, and you realize what you're
                    doing was not always in the best interest of the United States. But there was a
                    strong relationship with the U.S. military there, whose feelings they made very
                    clear to the embassy consular people at the highest levels, that if an American
                    officer wants to do this, we're not going to be investigating these fraudulent
                    claims, and we're not going to be looking at how much money this guy got, or
                    what the deal was. But I do remember being astounded at this one guy bringing
                    over somebody whose wife was older than his mother, and they clearly knew
                    nothing about each other. And I remember when I was pushing it, I was kind of
                    being told, “But this is not our wish, and we're not going to do this.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was there, we had been interviewing American
                        civilians, usually military who are out of the military, who would come

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we used to actually refuse marriages. We had this
                        joint interview. We'd ask them each how much they knew each other, and find
                        out there was no real connection. After I left I think the question was put
                        to Washington. They said, “Don't do it!”</hi>

                        they hit the United States are as little tigers, and they're not going to

                    after doing these, you know, this was sometimes frustrating.</p>
                <p>And on the adoption side I got to meet the adoption agencies, find out how they
                    met with people in the United States. It was very interesting, because the
                    Koreans had gotten a lot of criticism during the Olympics, and then the foreign
                    journalists came in, and there were headlines, and there were stories about
                    Korea's number two export, behind cars, being babies and children for adoption.
                    Part of it was that it was very well run, and if someone for one reason or
                    another could not keep their child, you know, they were in service, they would
                    give it up. Some of the agencies were tied to churches and Christian
                    organizations. I think we got to know it pretty thoroughly, and that it wasn't a
                    fraudulently run operation, and that they did have the interests of the children
                    at heart.</p>
                <p>I didn't know (it was very interesting) that when Korean couples adopted, it was
                    extremely secret. They would hide it from the mother-in-law because it would be
                    a great shame if the woman couldn't conceive herself. You'd be in the agencies,
                    and they'd show you files. Then, there would be these locked files behind these
                    locked doors, and that was where the Korean domestic adoptions were done. I
                    thought it was very interesting.</p>
                <p>But, after the stories in the press, they pretty much said they were going to
                    shut down the adoptions, except for the handicapped. They would let those go,
                    and they were very straight-faced about saying it, “Well, of course, we wouldn't
                    keep the handicapped! We'll take care of our?” The story was, “We will take care
                    of our own children. You know, if there are problems, and a family needs to give
                    a child up, or a grown woman needs to give a child up, we Koreans, we can take
                    care of this ourselves.”</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>So, while I was there, there was a lot of concern in the United States that this
                    meant they were shutting down the adoptions. The U.S. had meetings with Korean
                    government officials, which is not something I had a lot of experience with. But
                    I found an issue which got me out of the Visa Section, and that was very
                    interesting. We found out that there was a public way of doing things and
                    reality. As long as there were Americans looking to take care of these children,
                    and these adoption agencies still had kids who needed to be adopted, if they
                    couldn't be placed domestically, the agencies were still going to send them out
                    internationally. I think there were 7,500 children a year adopted out of Korea
                    to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The majority of them were girls, weren't they, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I don't know. My nephew is a boy. But he was older when he was adopted; he
                    was four years old. I don't know if it was a majority of girls or not. To tell
                    you the truth, I didn't notice. I don't remember focusing on that.</p>
                <p>But I do know that it was so surprising to American sensibilities that they would
                    say, “If a child has a harelip or a heart defect, of course we're going to let
                    somebody else take him, because we're not going to keep him here. And the truth
                    is that Americans would adopt children with physical impairments, and spend the
                    money to help them and heal whatever their difficulty or their problem was, and
                    take them into their homes. It was a very interesting process, and I got to know
                    a lot about Korean sensibilities from the way that they handled that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when I was there, ten or more years before you were
                        there, we had the same thing. The Koreans kept saying they were going to
                        shut this down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the truth of the matter was that, if Koreans adopted a
                        child overtly, that child would end up as a slave to the family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, because they were second-class, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And most of the adoptions usually were picking up somebody
                        from a third cousin or something, and getting them -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: In the bloodline.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?yes, on the bloodline, and getting them put onto - I mean
                        they would cook the birth records and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that was how adoptions really were handled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very successful program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was, and I must say, I know a lot of American families. I have a good
                    friend, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, who is a member of Congress from
                    Philadelphia. She adopted a little girl from Korea and was well known for it. I
                    think she was the first single woman to adopt from overseas. She wrote a book
                    about it. She was an advocate for it. She and her husband took many children
                    from Korea, and did place them, and gave them medical care, and all that kind of
                    stuff. They were sincere in what they were doing, and I thought that was
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. When I was there, we had one woman that came to my
                        attention. I said, “Oh, we're sending a child to Mia Farrow and Andr�
                        Previn.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, gosh! Soon-Yi!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who later became quite famous in sort of a scandal with
                        marrying Woody Allen. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. That's right. Oh, isn't that interesting. That's right. She did come
                    from Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Why was it that I missed the nice part of the job. That was the fun part of
                    the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, what was your impression of Korea at the time
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>LOAR: You know we'd been in Mexico. We got there in warm weather, and we had the
                    language. We got nice housing in a really beautiful Mexican neighborhood, and my
                    son could walk down the street to the Montessori school. When we got to Korea,
                    we were on an Army base. Now, I had never been on a military base before. The
                    diplomatic compound was on the military base, Yongsan, so you're completely cut
                    off from Korean society. Plus, we didn't have the language. The only ones who
                    really had the language right were the Peace Corps volunteers or those who were
                    really, really good and spent two years studying (which I didn't think was in my
                    temperament to do). And, surrounding this military base, you have to go through
                    checkpoints. You know what it's like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: You have to go through checkpoints with giant American men with assault
                    guns, through various checkpoints until you get to your little housing compound;
                    and the little housing compound also was a tad worrisome because every house was
                    the same!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And we used to call it Levittown on the River Han.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: You know, the Han River in Korea. The house we had was less attractive than
                    the rest because you had to go down the steps. We were told, “Oh, that gets
                    flooded an awful lot.” Gee, I looked forward to that! They were white
                    cinderblock houses. You went in, and the furniture was all this sort of standard
                    issue, and I remember thinking, “Well, I just won't entertain. Just let it be
                    known - I'm not entertaining! No one's setting foot in this house!”</p>
                <p>And then, over time, like anything else, you get used to everything, and you
                    value the checkpoints, because your kids can walk around and play day and night
                    on the compound. It did take awhile though. There were soldiers who had guns,
                    and I had no experience with walking around with people who had arms. And I had
                    no idea what they - I mean I wasn't doing anything bad, but how did I know that
                    they had that a positive view towards me or my sons?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>LOAR: You were in this strange little military base in the middle of Korea, where
                    they had movies for 50 cents, Baskin Robbins, Burger King, and the largest
                    commissary in the world, where they had more brands of Oreos and more variations
                    on Oreos than in any supermarket I had ever seen. And it was just the strangest
                    cultural thing. Korea was one cultural experience. But it was being on this
                    military base, and I said, “We're not going to unpack, you know. They paid for
                    us to get here, but we're not staying!” And I really did not expect to stay. I
                    thought we'd go back, or I thought, “I just don't want to move, but that would
                    mean I'd have to spend the rest of my life here,” which was not attractive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it was a very hard adjustment, and that was sort of a signal that,
                    “Gee, maybe we're not cut out for this moving from post to post thing. Maybe we
                    just started this too late in life, or maybe it's just not a good mix for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Both Richard and I were working, so we both had to report to work right
                    away, because you're a tandem couple. “Well, that's great, but we don't give a
                    rat's ass! Come in to work!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And that wasn't the case, though, when I actually got into the job. Kathy
                    Cahir said, “Get yourself set, and when you have your kids set in school, and
                    you have your house all set, then you report to work. I don't want to see you
                    till you're set.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?which was a very smart management decision </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?because I wasn't distracted. And, of course, I didn't believe that she
                    meant that, because I thought, “Huh! You can't mean this, so I'll keep coming
                    in!” She goes, “Did you get your shipment?” “No.” “Well then, what are you doing
                    here? You get that taken care of! Any kids that registered in school? No? Then
                    stop.” That was just so smart, because she knew that I wasn't going to be
                    focused right now.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Richard didn't have [laughter], anybody telling him that, and I knew I was going
                    to take care of it. So he did walk into the Political Section and start
                    work.</p>
                <p>But we had to take our childcare with us, because we were so concerned. It's not
                    something they [the Foreign Service] have in their sensibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: If you had a tandem couple and there's some children involved in the mix,
                    that somewhere along the line someone's going to have to be responsible for
                    that. But we did have our interim childcare we took from Mexico. She was
                    actually a European graduate student. She came back to the United States. Of
                    course, we paid for her fare back to the United States. When we were in
                    consultation, we paid for her hotel room in Washington. All of this was out of
                    pocket, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We stopped in Hawaii on the way. She had her separate airfare, her separate
                    everything, so that we could have some continuity. She was with us for a month,
                    which was really, really great for the kids. That really helped us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: This was our childcare person wasn't a stranger. It didn't seem at the time
                    that I was in the Foreign Service that they had any particular concerns about
                    tandem couples having particularly different challenges. You get two housing
                    costs for one and all that. They did have challenges with regards to how you got
                    assignments; and, then, if there were children, how you began work and your
                    official responsibilities. But partly that wasn't the norm. I don't know what
                    percentage of the Foreign Service were tandems. They said we were one of the few
                    to come in together. We had met each other before we came in and came in as a
                    couple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We were one of the very few they knew who had done that. Some tandem
                    couples had met when they were in, or some had one spouse who came in and then
                    later the other spouse came in. But it wasn't like anyone had given any thought
                    to tandem couples' particular challenges, or needs, or opportunities in the
                    Foreign Service. So that was a bit of a challenge.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>But you know, you get used to life on the military base and then you take your
                    little shuttle bus to work; and that was also very interesting, riding on this
                    military bus [laughter]. But then we became very good friends with our
                    neighbors. We were on the north side of the big street on the compound, so they
                    called us the North Koreans. We had great pride in being that; and we became
                    very close to the people on our north side of the compound. We are still very
                    close to some of those folks including a great officer, Al O'Neal (who would be
                    a great person for you to talk to), who had a Korean-born wife, Jen O'Neal, whom
                    he actually met in the United States when she was teaching language. She taught
                    us a lot about Korea, and it was a really enriching and wonderful experience, so
                    that over time this isolated base and this isolated side of the compound really
                    became very much home to us. We got to like it a great deal. It was a challenge
                    and a great discovery for us. The people said it was just like Hawaii. It's a
                    great vacation spot!</p>
                <p>We were very spoiled in Mexico. We went to every beach resort; we just headed out
                    of town for three-day weekends. We had great diplomatic discounts, took the kids
                    everywhere, took our nannies with us on these vacations, and just hit all the
                    beaches;, and it was so much fun. We had the language, we knew which hotels?</p>
                <p>In Korea they're a hard-working people, to whom the idea of vacation is not
                    something that is usual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's something like a 54-hour week.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think is the norm -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or at least it was, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And so we figured, “Okay. Well, we need a little break. Let's go to
                    Cheju-do, which is the island in the south that's supposed to be like Hawaii,”
                    and the geography is like Hawaii. However, the amenities are not [laughter]!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>LOAR: The beaches are not! So it was a very interesting experience! But we did
                    relax by climbing mountains, because that's what you do when you're a
                    hard-working industrious Korean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And it was a great experience for us. Coming back on the plane ... I'll
                    never forget this. We were in the back of the plane, and everyone was in front
                    of us, and everyone had straight black hair, and I realized this was really a
                    homogeneous society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And there's one race, and conformity is so important, and men dyed their
                    hair if it went gray. It was just an eye-opener; I really was dying for
                    variety.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Then I remember one of our trips home, just looking around the United
                    States. I'm like, “Oh!” landing in LA (Los Angeles, California) and seeing
                    blacks, and Hispanics, and redheads, and blondes, and short people. I'm just
                    thinking I love this diversity, and I love this about the United States. I love
                    the range and the mix of who we are.</p>
                <p>So, that was hard to get used to. You were always the foreigner. I'd go out with
                    this wonderful team of Foreign Service Nationals, who were so lovely, so polite,
                    so nice, so kind, also very interested in my family and in how my husband
                    married me when my Chinese Zodiac sign was a horse, and a white horse at that,
                    which was very troublesome for women because it meant you had a fiery
                    temperament, and “Did he know that?” I learned so much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They were so open about themselves. I'd go out to eat with them and I'd try
                    to use my chopsticks as best I could, and I was always stared at. I was always
                    the odd person in a restaurant, the odd person on the street.</p>
                <p>Even though there were 40,000 American troops there, you were still odd looking,
                    and I just never felt that I blended in. I thought, “Well, if I wear my glasses,
                    and I wear a hat, and they can't see that my hair's this color, can they still
                    tell that I don't blend in?</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>It was such an interesting experience, and now I know how people feel when they
                    come to the United States, and they just don't feel like they're in the right
                    place. We would go hiking with the kids on the Korean national holidays, and
                    we'd do all the Korean things of hiking mountains. The Korean ladies and the
                    Korean grandmothers would come up to my sons and grab them by the cheeks and
                    touch their skin. My son was, what was he? Second grade? I guess that was first
                    or second grade, and he did not like strange, older women coming up and granny
                    hugging him, so we gave him a walking stick and taught him the word for “please
                    don't touch me,” and then he would sort of like push off with the “please don't
                    touch me!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it's just that it was very enriching and fabulous. We wrote a lot of
                    letters home, and letters to my uncle who had served overseas for USAID (United
                    States Agency for International Development), and to the extended family. We
                    were writing a lot about our experiences and reporting back to them what was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, the Far East is entrancing no matter how you
                        look at this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, yes! Utterly interesting! Just fascinating, and a great chance to see
                    things, and learn about the food, and that Koreans are so private until you
                    break through, and then they are so warm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point. And the next time when we
                        pick this up, we've talked about the work in the Non [NIV].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing other work than?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I did American Citizen Services, which is another enriching
                    phenomenon!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll talk about American [Citizen] Services. We've
                        already talked about the visa side of things, we've talked about living on
                        the compound, and next time we'll be talking about 1) your impression of the
                        government, and the Korean's society as such, using your Foreign Service eye
                        on this; and also [2] about American Services, and the expat community.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Today is 23 May 2002. Theresa, we're in South Korea.
                        You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Let's see?I left there in '91, so maybe '89 to '91 I'd say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eighty-nine, okay, to ninety-one. Well, let's talk about a
                        couple of things. You said you were doing American Services for a
                        while.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I did consular work over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What did this sort of consist of? Can you tell any
                        stories or tell us of anything-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, this was Korea right after the '88 Olympics, when there was a big
                    opening for Korea, when they changed a lot of the public signs on the roads, and
                    not just have it in Hangeul (modern name for Korean alphabet), but in English as
                    well to make Korea more open to outsiders. It was a big point of pride for them
                    as a country. They felt they had reached a level of sophistication and an
                    opening up as a country, which was very important to them. So we went to Korea,
                    my husband and I, after that. We lived on the base, and I just don't remember
                    what I told you so far about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we talked about living on Compound One or Two, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we've talked about the time on the Immigrant Visa
                        line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then you were moved from Visas to American
                        Services.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Citizen Services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Citizen Services.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what were those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That were a large number of American citizens who were posted to the
                    military base, and an extremely high number of young single women who'd come in
                    to register their babies, which was shocking to me! I'm like, “You got it
                    together. You're in the military. Did you choose to have these? Do you have
                    some...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, having unwed mothers in the military doesn't seem to
                        work at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think it probably may have come from the communities they came
                    from, Where unwed pregnancies were pretty common. And that was shocking to me,
                    and I was always really dying to ask them questions, which, of course, we
                    couldn't do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you can't, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And there were lots of Americans who came over to teach English, and got
                    themselves in weird situations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There was an interesting case of a couple of American women - one American
                    woman murdering another one; and that was a fascinating thing, because then we
                    had a U.S. attorney come over to investigate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had sparked that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That was before my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The investigation was when I was there, and I was less interested, frankly,
                    in delving into why! [Laughter] But we wanted to provide cooperation to them,
                    because they were really trying to get at what happened there. And it was a
                    relationship deal. It always is, isn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>And we also had a lot of Korean citizens who had left Korea during the dark years
                    and the tough times, when the government was very oppressive. They had
                    immigrated to the United States, and had gotten an education (like a lot of
                    Korean immigrants do here), and had made something of themselves. They were
                    coming back to Korea and hoping to do something to contribute to their society;
                    to be able to profit economically and to play a role. So there was a lot of
                    giving up their American citizenship and getting back their Korean citizenship.
                    I don't remember the details. I did know it extremely well then. I remember
                    thinking, “We certainly want these people to come back and to contribute to
                    what's going on in Korea, but why do they have to give up their American
                    citizenship? Why wouldn't they be able to just make that contribution?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There was a lot of that, and it was an interesting phenomenon to see more
                    and more Koreans coming back, and feeling like they had a chance to do something
                    here, or profit from the economic openings that were happening in Korea. That
                    was sort of the rest of the work. We had young Americans who would die and leave
                    their estates, and one very interesting man who was retired military (because a
                    lot of retired military stayed on in Korea, especially if they had Korean
                    spouses). This guy had a huge ivory collection. Our job was to inventory it, and
                    you had to be very careful how you sent ivory into the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I remember that as an interesting project - looking at these beautiful,
                    gorgeous pieces of carved ivory and inventorying that to go back.</p>
                <p>The head of ACS (American Citizen Services) when I came in was Vince Principe
                    [Vincent Principe], a wonderful Foreign Service officer. Lovely man, who would
                    bake cakes for the marines and for the section. He was just a generous, kind
                    person , who had a deep belief in protecting Americans and providing services.
                    He would go out and give speeches (I remember this) to American business groups
                    about the dangers of Americans driving in Korea, because, of course, the great
                    danger was that if you drove and you got into an accident, you would be blamed
                    for whatever happened to that person, and their family, and anything else, Bad
                    Karma, that might happen to this family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>LOAR: There was a lot of outreach. We had a number of interesting cases with
                    mentally ill Americans who needed to go back to the United States. The challenge
                    was how we were going to get them back, and getting cooperation with the
                    airlines that are not American airlines. So there were a lot of economic issues
                    with American companies, and with trying to get their cooperation and help in
                    getting Americans back to the United States whom they didn't want in Korea, and
                    whom we didn't particularly want in America. But what the heck! They were
                    Americans, and they were going to go there.</p>
                <p>But I remember coming into this section, I was the second American officer in
                    ACS. We had Vince who was head of the section, and they'd never had a second
                    officer before. I was offered a desk that I shared with one of the Korean FSNs,
                    and a phone line I shared with them. I thought, “Gee, hmm, I'm a second tour
                    Foreign Service officer. Perhaps I could have my own phone line, and perhaps
                    even I could have an office to sit in.” At this time, my husband was up in the
                    Political Section and, of course, had a very nice office; and my other good
                    friend, whom we started with in the Foreign Service, was in the Econ Section,
                    and had a nice office, and a desk, and a secretary. I thought, “Gee, shouldn't
                    this happen to the American officer in this section?” I suggested that to the
                    consul general, who said, “Yea?mmm?sure?that's a good idea.” But not much
                    happened.</p>
                <p>And then there was this wonderful guy - I wish I could remember his name - who
                    was up in the Admin (Administrative) Section. I said, “Don't you think American
                    officers should have their own offices?” He was a really nice guy in the Admin
                    Section (he might have been the deputy head of Admin in Seoul at the time) and
                    came down, and of course the Foreign Service Nationals thought it would be
                    appropriate, “Why doesn't Mrs. Loar have an office?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure, oh, yes! I mean, why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They thought it was inappropriate that I didn't have one. “Mrs. Loar, you
                    need an office.” They were just so great, so earnest, and educated, and
                    dedicated. And so we cooked it up with this admin guy, and he built this office
                    in his section. [Laughter] Then the consul general who was downstairs said,
                    “Really nice idea, very good, ah huh!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: “So glad you thought of it sir!” And then the Foreign Service Nationals
                    took it upon themselves to get the furniture, because the embassy put old crappy
                    furniture in the office, and it was “Oh! No, no, no. Mrs. Loar, you need good
                    furniture!” And I had the best couch and chairs in this office. It was nice. Now
                    the second officer had a permanent office in there. That was actually a fun
                    little project to do. But it was a little bit of consular officers being sort of
                    these second-class citizens.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run into the phenomenon of GIs marrying Korean
                        women, and in many cases it was very suspicious. In other words, that this
                        was a put up deal, that they would get them into the United States, and then
                        they would go separate ways.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, that was over in the IV (Immigrant Visa) Section. That was in my
                    rotation in the IV Section. I don't know if I talked about that with Kathy Cahir
                    being the head of that section. She was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was just wondering because when I was there, I'm
                        thinking not so much a GI, an American would come to Korea and often meet an
                        older woman, sometimes of dubious reputation, at the airport, fall
                        immediately in love -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, yes! Lifelong commitment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And want to get married the next day, you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, there's a lot of that. Actually I remember having a soldier sit
                    before me who was about 19, and the woman that he was bringing over to be his
                    wife was older than his mother! “And did you tell your mom about this? Does Mom
                    know that your bride to be?” [Laughter], and the bottom line was, there was no
                    interest in looking into that. If an American soldier said, “I'm telling you
                    that I'm going to marry this person,” than that's what was going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We stopped it! Anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There wasn't much interest in that, and we could be as sarcastic and have
                    as much fun as we wanted, but at the end of the day, that was going to go
                    forward. It was discouraging to me that we weren't more serious about some of
                    the fraud issues, but I guess you do your best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about American business people? The Koreans can be
                        pretty rough in business deals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mid-career type people in a shoe factory or something,

                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>LOAR: There were a number of similar disputes where Americans or Korean Americans
                    would get arrested; and who would say they did something wrong or immoral, and
                    these were really commercial disputes. They would just put the Americans in jail
                    because they didn't get from them something they thought the Americans should
                    have paid, whether it was compensation for something, or just that they didn't
                    pay their bill or a bill that they thought they should pay. There were a number
                    of those kinds of interesting, odd cases that took a lot of negotiation, where
                    the Econ Section would get involved, and the trade ministry, and they would
                    decide whether this American who committed this terrible violation of not paying
                    the bribe or kickback could get out of jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There was a case where an American was involved in an automobile accident,
                    and was sent away. The company spirited the person out of the country right
                    away, because they were going to go after all the assets of the company to pay
                    for the damage done to the Korean who was hit in the accident, and the Korean
                    wasn't killed. It was this idea that if a person is hurt, breaks a leg, or
                    something, then your company has to compensate for all of that.</p>
                <p>I actually didn't spend that much time in ACS. I spent a lot of time on the
                    Immigrant Visa line. The ACS time was the interesting time, because it was a
                    chance to broadly see what the needs of Americans were. But the military took
                    care of itself very well most of the time. So it wasn't like in Mexico City,
                    where people would come down and find themselves in jail for drug use, and all
                    that kind of stuff. It was a much calmer pace and a calmer time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of the Korean government. Your dealing
                        with aspects of it, and Korean rule per se.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I had a chance to work with the government on the issue of adoptions.
                    I don't remember if we talked about this before, or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, talk about it again even if you talked about it
                        before.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>LOAR: After the Olympics, the Koreans were embarrassed by the international press
                    that had headlines like, “Korean Number One Export is Cars, Number Two Export is
                    Orphans,” because at that time there were 6,000 or 7,000 Korean children adopted
                    a year overseas. So, while they sort of shut it down, it was still going on. I
                    had this time on my hands, and bored to death with my job, and was looking for
                    some more oomph and some more opportunities for substance. I talked to people in
                    the different ministries, and they pretty much would say, flat out, “Look, if a
                    baby is damaged and there's something wrong with him, sure we'll let Americans
                    take him. Otherwise we are able to take care of our own.” They would say that,
                    but then the numbers would keep increasing. So I thought it was an interesting
                    thing: they had to act like they were saving face and not really saving
                    face.</p>
                <p>The adoption agencies were very well run, and extremely organized, and seemed to
                    be very concerned about the welfare of the children and about doing things
                    right. I think they had an interest in working well with the embassy to get the
                    adoptions done and the visas done, so the babies could go overseas. We had an
                    interest in having things go pretty smoothly. There were three or four different
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Korean society? Were you picking up things from
                        the local employees, and from observations, and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, the thing that struck me was how there was such an interest in
                    self-improvement. Well, for instance, my name was Theresa. There were three or
                    four different Koreans on the staff who were converting to Catholicism. Now, you
                    know, being Catholic my whole life, I'm like, “Gee, do you really know what the
                    deal is?” [Laughter] Perhaps I'm being sarcastic, but a lot of them took the
                    name Theresa. It was a self-improvement thing to convert, to study, and to come
                    into the faith - just like studying English. There were a large number of
                    Presbyterians and a fervor, a real strong desire, to improve yourself through
                    religion, through learning English, through all of these things.</p>
                <p>It really struck me how focused they were on getting the outside indicators of
                    what success would be, and getting those in line, and very concerned that their
                    children go to good schools, of course, and very concerned that people knew that
                    their children would go to good schools. It was almost like they didn't value
                    themselves as highly as they should have, considering where they had come from
                    after the Korean War. It really struck me that they undervalued themselves and
                    depended so much on outside validation for who they were and what they'd
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>But there were all the student protests when we were there - regular springtime
                    events. My take on that was that they worked really, really hard in high school,
                    and their mothers prayed really, really hard and long at the temples, the
                    Buddhist temples, to get them in to college, and when they got there, they just
                    kind of blew off a lot of steam and relaxed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then had time for these protests. Our older son Michael, at that time,
                    was at the Seoul Foreign School, which was right near Yonsei University. The
                    tear gas would come into his classroom, and he'd come home and then say,
                    [whispers] “Oh, yea! We had a protest today! It was great! Exciting!” And then
                    one time, one of the students climbed the wall to Seoul Foreign School - as if
                    they could care less about these little kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it was great excitement.</p>
                <p>The ambassador's residence was broken into when we were there. Don [Donald] Gregg
                    and his wife, who were just lovely people, were really admired by the Koreans.
                    Don Gregg, who had been CIA station chief many years ago, really cared a lot
                    about Korea. He and his wife, Meg, who were just very graceful, very nice people
                    liked by the embassy and admired by the Koreans, really knew their way around.
                    Their residence was broken into in the course of one of these student protests.
                    Supposedly, the students were protesting over U.S. trade. It was [laughter]
                    because the U.S. was forcing them to take in oranges and bananas, and we weren't
                    letting in their fruit. Yes, I mean that's a really cutting-edge issue for
                    students on campuses across Korea. So it was an orchestrated thing. But it was a
                    scary thing because the protesters jumped over the wall and got into the
                    residence. The Greggs were okay, but it did make everybody feel uneasy, and it
                    was uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then, a couple of weeks after that, we had a break-in in our home
                    within the military compound. Of course, everybody thought the worst. It was the
                    middle of the night, and there's a pounding on the back door. We got the kids,
                    and ran across the street to another house. It turned out it was some drunken
                    guy who had tried all the other doors on this street, and they were open. Ours
                    was locked in the back, so he was really mad, and he was kicking it. [Laughter]
                    And, of course, he circled the guard posts, who were all asleep. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter] Okay!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So he made his way down our street, on the North Korean side of the
                    compound. He got mad because our door was locked! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was terrifying, though, it was!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Because it was not very long after the break-in, we were sure that “Oh, my
                    gosh! Now they're coming into houses!” We had the typical cinder block Levittown
                    on the Han house, which was utterly charmless and looked like everything
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it just turned out that's what it was.</p>
                <p>There was a sense that it was inconvenient, because you had to alter your route
                    home, but there were these regular spring protests. They still go on, I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, they were during my time. What about the role
                        of Korean women? What were you seeing then, from your vantage point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, for one thing, I joined a group, that was just getting started, of
                    Korean women, and some American and foreign diplomats, and some journalists, who
                    had lived overseas and who had had international experience or who had worked
                    for or were working for, foreign companies in Korea. We would meet at this one
                    club somewhere downtown. My friend Caroline Wagner, who was an econ officer, and
                    I would go to these meetings together. It was fascinating, because these were
                    Korean women who had lived outside or worked within foreign national companies
                    so that they didn't have to play by the rules of what Korean society expected of
                    them. It was fascinating to me, because they were extremely well educated and
                    very articulate. The ones who lived overseas and came back to Korea were as
                    frustrated as heck as they were expected to live by a different standard, which
                    was not full participation. They were not getting access to the jobs that they
                    were prepared to do, educated to do, and capable of doing. At the beginning, it
                    was primarily foreigners in that group; but, and towards the end, it became
                    primarily Korean women, which I thought was really interesting.</p>
                <p>That's when I learned that the Korean government actually had a maternity policy
                    for working women, which our government didn't have at the time. [Laughter] So
                    we ran right back to get the State Department to jump on that one, but never got
                    anywhere with that.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>But it was interesting how they did certain things they valued and understood.
                    They wouldn't necessarily give women access to the highest jobs that were
                    available and were capable of doing, but they did want them in the work force;
                    and the fact they had a decent maternity policy would indicate that they wanted
                    them in the work force, which I thought was interesting.</p>
                <p>They also gave women a day off every month because you need that day off every
                    month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I always thought that was kind of an odd and interesting thing, “that
                    us skwemen 'ave (women have) our day off, you know.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I said, “Okay.” It's like I'd be embarrassed to ask for a day off every
                    month! But it was sort of a standard thing, and it was just, “You know why. It's
                    just we need to have it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any talk about women were now, by this
                        time, generally a graduate of Ewha Women's University, a top rate recruit,
                        that women were beginning to penetrate up or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, there was a professor — I forget which university, it may have been
                    Ewha — Park, Yong-Ock, who was focused on women's leadership in politics. I got
                    to know her through Richard. We got to hear some of the things she was trying to
                    do (and she's visited me here a number of times since then, and I'd really like
                    to catch up with her, as a matter of fact). She was looking for openings for
                    women in the political parties, and hearing about how women in other countries
                    did it, and how women were ready to take that place, and were ready to get in
                    there - not just in companies and private companies, but in the government, as
                    well. But, no, I didn't see many women moving into high positions. Richard knew
                    a lot of the people in the foreign ministry, but you didn't really see women
                    diplomats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And later, and when I was back at the State Department more recently, I had
                    some women come on a delegation that was sent by their government to look at the
                    model that we had at the State Department on this Interagency Council on Women.
                    They included some women from ministries in that, but not all. There were men
                    who were sent to take a look at this model, which I thought was very
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it probably makes sense, otherwise it would be a
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It'd be machoist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it would be a sealed off thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it wouldn't go anywhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. But it was an interesting opportunity.</p>
                <p>A lot of the Foreign Service Nationals who worked at the embassy were very well
                    educated, capable women. They had great pressure, of course, to produce sons; it
                    was thought to be lucky to have two sons, which I have. I remember one who had
                    one child, a girl, and she was going to have another baby pretty soon, and
                    everyone prayed it'd be a boy. When it wasn't a boy it was a tragedy. Because
                    she had two children, which was just kind of a standard number, and no boys, her
                    mother-in-law was really going to give her a hard time. I thought that was kind
                    of sad because a healthy successful pregnancy is a reason for joy. So that was
                    the undervaluing of girls, in looking at that experience.</p>
                <p>There was an officer at the time named Richard Pittard, who did a reporting cable
                    on prenatal sex selection. Because of sonar scans and sonograms, couples were
                    able to look at the fetus to see if it was a boy or a girl. They were selecting
                    not to continue the pregnancies of girls; they would only really focus on
                    continuing the pregnancies of the male fetuses. He was blocked from sending that
                    back to Washington because there was concern that if enemies of Korea on the
                    Hill, like perhaps Senator [Jesse] Helms and others, got that cable, they would
                    really come after Korea hard and try to come down on them. The people in the
                    embassy didn't want that to happen. But interestingly enough, prenatal sex
                    selection is a phenomenon throughout Asia. Now looking back at that Richard
                    Pittard had something there. It's a problem in China and it's a problem in many
                    other places where there's a shortage of girls. And there's going to be a
                    shortage of brides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To carry, you know -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Gotta procreate guys!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it takes two to tango! You know, I mean really!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, that's right. But it was an indication of the undervaluing of girls
                    and of women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well then, you left there in what, '91?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Ninety-one, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We came back to Washington. I had been a consular officer, but wanted to go
                    work on a desk. As a consular officer, the desk offices had no interest at all
                    in having USIA apply, so I thought, “Oh, yea. That job looks like a good job.”
                    I'd try to find out what the good jobs were. I wanted to be on a desk. Richard
                    wanted to be on a desk. Richard, who had done politico-military affairs, had
                    people begging him to -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sure, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?bid on this and bid on that [laughter], and I got was: “Well, you could
                    try.” I got the Costa Rica desk. I thought, “Fine. I'll take it, just so I know
                    the new job is set.” All the more senior people at the State Department, in the
                    embassy there in Seoul, said, “You know, a desk job is a great place to go,” and
                    we had a wonderful country team, people who had been in the Foreign Service for
                    a long time. We really had a good country team and a good sort of esprit de
                    corps. We had Ray Burkhart as our DCM. It was good after we got used to the fact
                    that you were always an outsider in Korea, and even with just a little tiny bit
                    of language you're not ever going to blend in.</p>
                <p>For our family, it was an interesting time, because we really did a lot of
                    different things culturally, and traveled throughout Asia, and all of that. But
                    you always stand out; you're always the foreigner, and you're never going to
                    blend in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel while you were there of the threat
                        from the north?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, we had a lot of CODELs that came through. And, of course they didn't
                    have consular officers handling CODELs. But my husband - the kind, supportive
                    husband that he is - would try to throw some my way. So I got Pat Schroeder. I
                    had a chance to show her around. I admired her as a congresswoman, and was
                    really glad to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She really was very helpful in getting pension rights and
                        things like this. Oh, boy!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. And she, you know, was on </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congresswoman from Colorado.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Colorado, Pat Schroeder from Colorado, and she was on the Armed Services
                    [House Armed Services Committee], I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, she was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was actually during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that she came, just
                    after that, and I think I was her control officer then. I'm just trying to
                    remember that. The goal was to try and get the Koreans to kick in their fair
                    share, which they had absolutely no intention of doing [laughter], and they were
                    pretty clear about that. But Pat Schroeder and a congressman from Upstate New
                    York were going around making the rounds.</p>
                <p>Actually Pat Schroeder came around Valentine's Day. She brought Valentine's Day
                    candy and cards for all the Foreign Service Nationals and the American officers.
                    She was so thoughtful and wonderful.</p>
                <p>She was someone I really admired, because she was a woman elected in her own
                    right and not on her husband's or her father's coattails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She made it a point to take issues that were affecting women's lives and to
                    put them on the legislative agenda for the United States. Years later, there was
                    a great cover story in the New York Times Magazine about her and how her stuff
                    has come to the mainstream now. But, she really had done tremendous work. I
                    remember her talking about Social Security issues. She really looked at the
                    basic needs that American women had and found witty, sometimes sarcastic,
                    sometimes very dramatic ways of talking about it. And she really did it on her
                    own right.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>So I was thrilled to have a chance to escort her up to the DMZ (Demilitarized
                    Zone) and to do the ritual of visiting to see what the troops are like and what
                    the issues are. But I would never as a consular officer have been asked to do
                    that. They did not ask consular officers to do that. They give them all to
                    political-econ officers, and it was only because my husband interceded that I
                    got this opportunity.</p>
                <p>I had another chance. I had Geri [Geraldine] Ferraro, whom I also admire greatly
                    on a visit. She and her husband had come to Korea. She was terrific. And I
                    actually got to know her very well later on, when we did the Beijing Women's
                    Conference. She was on our delegation. She's one of those people that the more
                    you know her, the more you like her. She also was a great person who had just
                    broken through on her own, and was active and making her mark in politics. Those
                    were fun isolated incidents.</p>
                <p>We always went up to the north; I even got a helicopter ride once [laughter]. My
                    husband also arranged that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the DMZ was very quiet -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The sense of the danger from the north was palpable, but it wasn't
                    exploding. They blasted that music, and did this and they did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But there was no ? you know, that I was aware of, a real sense that it was
                    going to ... there was reason for cause or alarm. Not that that wasn't
                    reflecting on people in the ERs (emergency rooms), which I found so amusing!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That “in this time of tension, living here on this border, blah, blah,
                    blah.” For onward assignments, people would always say, “_____ is more less
                    relaxing, yet less stressful, more relaxing.” But here is the biggest commissary
                    in the world with more configurations of Oreo cookies than I had seen in U.S.
                    markets because these are American soldiers, and they need every brand of Oreo
                    cookie.</p>

                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>LOAR: So anyways, I thought it somewhat an exaggerated claim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. Well, everyone always does this, you know. I was
                        in Personnel when they were trying to cut down on people abroad, and every
                        place said “because of the time of crisis in______,” and you could fill in
                        whatever country it was. It was always a time of crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                    then moved on to the Nicaragua desk for a couple of years, I guess, '92 to

                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: What the heck is ?[Laughter] What's new in Costa Rica? Of course they
                    probably figured since I was so determined to get a desk, and Ray Burkhart, who
                    was the DCM, said, “Just get a desk, any desk, it doesn't matter.” And then when
                    I told him I had Costa Rica, he said, “But not Costa Rica! That's junk!”
                    [Laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>

                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>LOAR: “There's nothing going on there. There are no issues.” And I said, “Yes,
                    but nobody else wanted me. I was a consular officer, you know.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay! Well, I interviewed a man now back in the?Curtin
                        Winsor, who'd been ambassador, political appointee, to Costa Rica in the
                        '70s; and I asked if he had any delegations visit him while he was there;
                        and he said yes, he had one, the lieutenant-governor of Mississippi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So we came back. The move back to Washington, of course, was very hard, and
                    that's when we decided, “Okay. That's it. We're not moving around anymore.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I really do think that was the time we decided that while we really loved
                    the work overseas, we weren't going to continue to move. My husband Richard was
                    in EUR/RPM (Bureau of European Affairs/Office of Regional Security and Political
                    Affairs) and had a very active, go-get-'em job, you know. It was really
                    important, and it was NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) issues with more
                    on the military side. And I had Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>The president of Costa Rica was coming just about a week or two after I got
                    there, and I was thinking, “Oh, sure. Presidential visit, what's the big deal?”
                    And it was actually fun because right away I was brought into getting everything
                    ready for the visit. Rafael �ngel Calder�n Fournier was a nice guy; we liked
                    him, like we do most of the Costa Rican presidents.</p>
                <p>And I remember going to the Protocol Office. The head of Protocol for the State
                    Department at the time was Jennifer, I want to say Fitzgerald or something like
                    that, a very stylish lady. I remember being in the meeting to plan for the visit
                    and she said, “So they'll land on the mall,” and I'm thinking, “What mall?
                    because, I have to know where I have to be. She said, “The Washington Mall,” and
                    I go, “Yes, okay.” [Laughter] “And you'll be there among the greeters.” We got
                    to go through Blair House and to see where they'd be staying, which was fun. We
                    got to check all that stuff out.</p>
                <p>What were the key issues? Bananas became the key issue. It was a nice friendly
                    relationship, but nothing that was particularly compelling. I actually had a
                    colleague on the Honduras desk, who had many more interesting things to do than
                    I did. At first I was so intimidated by being on a desk, because I felt that as
                    a consular officer, what could I know, and do, blah, blah, blah.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Then, after a few months, I was bored stiff because everybody else had more
                    interesting work. Dave Schuler on Honduras said, “Bananas - I have one word for
                    you - bananas. Look at the banana trade affecting Central America, and at
                    American companies, especially Chiquita Brands, who have most of the banana
                    plantations in Central America, and are really fighting tooth and nail - a
                    really tough, tough fight - with the Europeans who had their banana plantations
                    elsewhere, like Ecuador and the Caribbean. Just look at that issue, because it's
                    really going to affect the economies of Central America if they cannot export
                    their bananas to Europe.”</p>
                <p>So not knowing anything about anything, I sort of jumped into that issue, and
                    actually had a lot of fun with it, and became known as the “Banana Queen,” and
                    got to know Bob [Robert] Gelbard, who was the principal desk in the Latin
                    America Bureau at that time. He had a strong economic background, and saw that
                    there were issues related to trade, but also issues related to the economic
                    well-being of Central American companies involved in this.</p>
                <p>USTR (Office of the United States Trade Representative), of course, was saying,
                    “Back away! Back away!” and the Economic Bureau at that time was absolutely
                    hostile to the idea that any desk officer would get involved in something
                    related to trade. Bob Gelbard loved a good fight though, so it was a perfect
                    issue for him. He was able to really stick up for the Central Americans. It was
                    very interesting because Larry Eagleburger was very concerned about the economy
                    of some of the Caribbean states who were affected by this, and it was very
                    interesting. I actually worked with some guy who became a member of Congress,
                    Robert Jones Portman, and with Joseph Hagin who now is Deputy Chief of Staff in
                    the Bush White House. I remember that they all worked for Chiquita Brands, and
                    they were pushing for free trade, which is an often-used and
                    often-misrepresented word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's it..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But our interests, from the State Department's side, was that the economies
                    of these Central American companies' countries don't get really disadvantaged by
                    the Euro banana traders, and that American companies, of course, get their fair
                    treatment as well, whatever that might be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, was there any progress made on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>LOAR: No, there was not. I think I was out of government when some progress was
                    made, so that would mean that it was in the last year or so, that there was
                    actually some progress. They said this one person sent me a note: “Do you
                    believe it! They finally achieved some resolution.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it took a long time, and then so much money was involved and such huge
                    numbers of jobs that would be created or lost, and huge trading routes.
                    Actually, it was interesting. I hadn't worked on trade before. I found it very
                    interesting to see the role that USTR would play, or not play. At that time I
                    thought the Economic Bureau wasn't being particularly aggressive in the way it
                    worked with USTR. It was more like, “Okay, you tell us what to do, and we'll be
                    your service agency.” Perhaps it was unfair, but Bob Gelbard liked it because it
                    was a fight, with economic issues. He knew trade, and he knew that these Central
                    American countries were really going to get screwed if they did not get their
                    shot at those trading routes.</p>
                <p>The other issues were repatriation of?no, that was the Nicaragua desk. I think
                    that was pretty much it.</p>
                <p>Luis Guinot, Jr. - now this was under President Bush I, the first President Bush
                    [George H. Bush]. He had sent the political appointee ambassador, Louise Guinot,
                    who was a Hispanic man from the Washington area. He was a very nice guy, and it
                    just didn't seem like we had a lot of difficulties, because the banana stuff
                    became fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, the banana thing, of course, is part of this
                        war that would go on and on particularly on agricultural products, between
                        the United States and the European Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when you start messing with those, you're talking
                        about messing with each other's jugular vein.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean these were not taken lightly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. I actually think Chiquita Brands may have gone bankrupt since then.
                    It's the Lindner family. They're huge contributors to both political parties. I
                    remember watching them, because batting so up close, I was the only one who
                    cared about their little banana issue, you know. So, Rob Portman, who is a
                    Republican member of Congress now from Ohio and Joseph Hagin, who's now one of
                    the Deputy Chiefs of Staff at the White House, were both working for Chiquita at
                    the time, and they were terrific guys to work with. I, of course, was somebody
                    paying attention to something they cared about, and they were grateful, I think,
                    to have some energy and interest in the issue and all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, when you moved over to the Nicaragua desk -
                        Nicaragua has always been a more touchy place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, the big issue there was the expropriation of property by the
                    Sandinistas from the people. Senator Helms was intensely interested in Nicaragua
                    at the time (Violeta Chamorro was the president at the time, I believe) and
                    intensely interested in making sure that the Sandinistas were punished for
                    anything they did; and in seeing that anybody who had their property taken away
                    got it back.</p>
                <p>The Bush administration at that time was continuing the aid to Nicaragua, but
                    Senator Helms was dead against it, and did not want any money going there; but
                    couldn't stop it, couldn't block the aid altogether, so did everything he could
                    to harass the State Department. Alec [Alexander] Watson, a very nice guy who had
                    been a career ambassador and was really well respected was going up to be
                    Assistant Secretary; and Senator Helms wouldn't give him a hearing unless the
                    State Department did the following: turn over every document that State
                    Department had generated on Nicaragua during a certain period of time, so that
                    they could find out whether AID (Agency for International Development) was
                    misusing the money or being too easy on the Nicaraguans. I'm sure they had many
                    reasons for wanting what they were looking for. But, at the end of the day, it
                    was a great hardship on our post, and on our ambassador, I don't remember who
                    our ambassador was to Nicaragua at that time, just a good guy though, but I
                    can't remember who it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can fill this in later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Ron [Ronald] Godard was the DCM; he was a very nice guy, and had a really
                    good team. Chris Ervs, who is brilliant - he was in our A-100 class - was the
                    econ officer down there, which was great, because I really did not have a heavy
                    grounding in economics. Chris helped me an awful lot with so many economic
                    issues on the desk.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>But what really dismayed me concerning the papers Senator Helms wanted on
                    Nicaragua was that there was nobody looking out for the Foreign Service officers
                    in the field over any frank comment the Foreign Service officer might have made
                    in any memo or emails directly to the DCM, or to the ambassador, or to anyone
                    back here in the States. We asked the L (Office of the Legal Advisor) people for
                    guidelines. “Okay, what are the materials we're supposed to turn over to Senator
                    Helms?” And there were no guidelines. The guidelines were on an unsigned piece
                    of paper and were kind of vague. So, in other words, how are we supposed to know
                    what's a draft or what's internal discussion, and what's appropriate for Senator
                    Helms? And I made that decision a number of times on my own. And, I remember
                    thinking, “Who in this room was looking out for the Foreign Service officer” who
                    gives his boss a frank assessment of what's going on?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And it was all about satisfying Senator Helms's desire for every piece of
                    paper and every bit of information, and in getting that up to him so Alec Watson
                    could get his hearings, which he deserved to have. It was ridiculous that we had
                    to hold these things up. But I also learned at that time to have a great deal of
                    paranoia, which served me well later on while I worked on international women's
                    issues in the UN conferences. People would say, “Gosh, why are you so paranoid?”
                    “Because there's a good reason to be paranoid. Because you can write a funny
                    little email back about something, and that can go to a senator on the Hill, who
                    will block you in the future, and will use it as evidence of your being
                    prejudiced or biased against somebody. There were memos, internal discussions,
                    where the ambassador said, “Well, what do you think about this? You know, before
                    we release this next cable, how do you think the Central Bank is doing on its
                    reform things?” And it really troubled me that there was nobody looking out for
                    the Foreign Service officers in the field, who had good careers ahead of them. I
                    realized you had to watch out for yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. By the time you got to the Nicaragua desk, the
                        Sandinistas had lost the elections?</hi>

                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, one of her son-in-laws was a very powerful figure - forgive me for
                    not remembering the name [Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren]. She wasn't a particularly
                    powerful figure. We would have liked her to be, and I certainly wanted to see a
                    woman president be a strong figure. But she wasn't particularly strong, and it
                    didn't seem to make much progress.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>I think it was a very sad situation, going down to Nicaragua to see the damage.
                    There was damage done to the main cathedral during one of the earthquakes, and a
                    lot of money came pouring in to fix it, and it was never fixed. When I was
                    there, Tom Monaghan, who founded Domino's Pizza, had given lots of money to
                    build a new cathedral, which was a ridiculous, ugly looking structure; and I
                    love cathedrals, and this one looked like somebody was in a really bad mood when
                    they designed it, but?[laughter]</p>

                <p>LOAR: The cathedral was going up. I guess that's a helpful thing - to have a new
                    cathedral in the city. But there seemed to be no progress. While El Salvador was
                    moving along, and seemed to be making progress, Nicaragua seemed not to make
                    progress. It seemed like the country just changed hands from one part of the
                    four or five families who ran things to another! They were all related, and all
                    their businesses were pretty much co-owned.</p>
                <p>I do remember one thing going back to the Costa Rica desk for a minute - coffee
                    is a big export. I remember the minister for trade owned the largest coffee
                    plantation. I remember thinking, “Is that possible that you guys can do that?
                    Can you regulate yourselves?” That seemed to be the issue. That government
                    service was a way to make sure your financial interests were enhanced and
                    protected, which was sad and depressing.</p>
                <p>But we had good leadership in the Latin American Bureau. Joe [Joseph] Sullivan
                    was the DAS (Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs) at
                    the time. He was one of the smartest people that I've ever worked with. He's
                    ambassador now to Zimbabwe. Joe was up to be an ambassador to be sent out. With
                    both Senator Helms's and Senator [Christopher] Dodd's staffs, there was someone
                    from each side in an unlikely, unholy alliance; they were convinced that Joe had
                    played some role that they thought was inappropriate in the past related to
                    Central American policy. They were going to block him. It was such a
                    demoralizing thing for all of us, who thought he was so smart, and wonderful,
                    and liked him so much, and wanted to see him succeed. But it also made you
                    realize that people could be blocked very easily for no particular reason from
                    moving ahead in their career.</p>
                <p>I did the Nicaragua desk for a while, and then moved from there. I could probably
                    even have more interesting things to say about what the relationship was, but, I
                    moved from there to be work on the Chile desk for a few months, and then moved
                    up to be special assistant to Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, Tim
                    Wirth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with Nicaragua, did you have the feeling that this
                        was a focal point of our foreign policy at one point and that after it was
                        done everybody washed their hands of it and moved on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I do think AID had a good strong mission there and a good strong
                    mission director. There was real interest in rebuilding the economy,
                    establishing rule of law, helping to build a court system, and investing in
                    civil society. But, there was constant pressure from the Hill, constant pressure
                    from Senator Helm's staff not to release that money. So it was a tremendous
                    battle. They had a huge AID mission led by Janet Ballantyne, who was terrific
                    and now is number two over at AID, I think [Counselor to the Administrator of
                    USAID].</p>
                <p>But it was a long road, and it wasn't helped by the government of Nicaragua,
                    itself. They didn't seem to be committed to reform, and still had incredibly
                    high poverty rates, and a fair amount of arms. One of the issues was on civilian
                    military affairs on trying to disarm the former combatants, and that seemed to
                    be a very, very slow thing.</p>
                <p>We also had ICITAP training (Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program).
                    One of these was in rule of law, and others were in judicial training, and in
                    law enforcement training. That was all going ahead at a very, very slow pace,
                    and I thought it was kind of depressing. At the El Salvador desk, where I had a
                    friend, they were making progress, and they are still making progress now. It
                    had to do with the government itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any word of wisdom, or something about why was
                        Helms was so down on Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The word was that Helms actually had Foreign Service Nationals in our
                    embassy in Managua faxing anything that they thought he should know about up to
                    his staff, which I thought was stunning. But of course, that was just a rumor.
                    No one knew that for sure.</p>
                <p>The feeling was that Helms felt about Nicaragua just like he felt towards Cuba:
                    the Communists had taken away things that these people owned, and they should be
                    giving those back to them. It was not Helms thought that the U.S. didn't believe
                    in that; our embassy team was heavily engaged in trying to return the
                    expropriated properties; but the return of the expropriated property to both
                    Nicaraguans and U.S. citizens became the reason for everything and the
                    overwhelming issue. And nothing anyone could do was ever energetic enough. It
                    was the same feeling I think that the Cuban Americans feel who've had their
                    properties taken away. These are legitimate concerns. You know, people had sugar
                    plantations confiscated.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>It was interesting because in Mexico, I had the aide to Humberto Ortega defect to
                    me, so I had no great respect for the Ortega brothers myself. So I knew some of
                    the stories about Humberto Ortega. His aide had laid out the corruption and the
                    money that was going off to other bank accounts. So it wasn't that I had any
                    great respect for the Sandinistas or the Ortega brothers. It's just that there
                    were other issues in their relationship, and that Senator Helms really refused
                    to move forward on any of the reconstruction pieces and the rebuilding of the
                    civil society until and unless these issues were covered first. I think that was
                    his standard. and he's never backed off of that, and really wanted to withhold
                    the aid. I think it was a very hard thing because the Bush administration really
                    wanted to move it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you moved and then there was the election. Did
                        that change things? Wirth came in with the Clinton administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, Tim Wirth. They set up a new undersecretary position, Undersecretary
                    for Global Affairs. Tim Wirth had been a congressman, and then a liberal
                    Democrat, senator from Colorado, known for his work on the environment. He set
                    up this new (G) Global Affairs.</p>
                <p>I think they were in operation for a whole year before I came up there, and I
                    came up sometime in '93-'94, I think. Rose Likins had been up there as the top
                    person, the executive assistant, and then Andy [Andrew] Sens. Andy Sens had
                    known me from the Latin American Bureau, and I was totally surprised that I'd
                    been considered as a candidate for those jobs, because I didn't think that was a
                    good fit, but I was very, very flattered and ended up liking working for Tim
                    Wirth, who I admire a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working for him for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Until I left to set up this office to prepare for the Beijing Women's
                    Conference, which was in June of '94, I worked about a year. Rose Likins had
                    left, which was a shame because Rose was wonderful. Andy Sens was the executive
                    assistant; there were three or four of us up there. My portfolio was
                    counternarcotics, refugees, and counterterrorism, because (G) included this
                    mishmash of bureaus. I always said that was great training for handling women's
                    issues later on [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>LOAR: Bob Gelbard was the Assistant Secretary for INL (Bureau of International
                    Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs), “Drugs and Thugs.” Phyllis Oakley came
                    in as head of the Population, Refugee, and Migration bureau. They had just added
                    Population to that, which was a difficult thing. Not everybody was so keen on
                    that. But that was a strong point of interest for Tim Wirth. What else was under
                    that? Counterterrorism - Barbara Bodine was head of counterterrorism. And it was
                    an interesting mix of things.</p>
                <p>Tim Wirth came in with the idea of really trying to build constituencies for
                    foreign policy, bringing NGOs (non-governmental organizations) into the process
                    of government. He had strong interests in population issues and the environment.
                    Those were his issues, he was really clear about that. He had these tremendous
                    political skills, which didn't fit altogether that well with the culture of the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But I have to say that he laid the groundwork for a lot of work that was
                    done later, and it was hard for him to do - breaking open the doors of the State
                    Department and letting NGOs in when the State Department doesn't see that it's
                    something that's particularly of value. And also, these issues on the
                    environment and population were not easy; there was strong opposition on the
                    reproductive health and the population issues. Concerning the environment: there
                    was a heavy backlash and confrontations with Congress on some of the
                    environmental things. Then Tim came in with a lot of energy and political
                    skills, and really tried to move things ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you mentioned you had counterterrorism, which has
                        now become sort of the almost principal focus of the government. Where did
                        it stand at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was a little office with a lot of military folks, a lot of civil
                    servants, not many Foreign Service officers rotated in and out of there. I think
                    Phil [Philip] Wilcox was head at one point and then Barbara Bodine. But I do
                    remember, in the time that we were up there, that that office had no particular
                    interest in sharing any information with Tim Wirth or the staff. So they were
                    going to go off and do their thing. They resented like heck that they had to be
                    involved with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of added on kind of to -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They were an office downstairs who really thought they should just be
                    reporting to the Secretary, and they probably were for all we knew; but this
                    structure they were under - this, under (G) - was an interesting mix.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>I do remember there was some huge capture during the time that we were there, and
                    that was considered a great victory. It might have been the fellow who bombed
                    the CIA headquarters here and who was picked up in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We got him out of Pakistan, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. And that was the year we </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he didn't bomb, but he attacked people in front of,
                        and coming in -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, he came into the CIA, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a machine gun pistol.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That's right! It wasn't a bombing. It was a gun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And they were very secretive, and I mean really had no interest in sharing,
                    “Look, you guys. You don't know. You don't need to know. You're out of the
                    loop.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, you pulled out whatever information you could to make sure that the
                    Undersecretary had the information he needed; and you tried to build
                    relationships, good as old relationships. If they thought that you were
                    trustworthy, they might tell you something; and if they thought you had a need
                    to know they might. But there was an awful lot of military folks who were on
                    detail from outside the State Department, and really just considered themselves
                    stand alone operatives that really had no particular need to fill in, blend
                    themselves in, or to be part of a team.</p>
                <p>There were two or three things where Tim was supposed to be on alert to know
                    something, but that wasn't really what Tim Wirth's interests were. There were
                    good Foreign Service officers who went into there, a number of whom had Near
                    East Asia backgrounds. So the people sort of rotated sometimes into that bureau,
                    who had spent some time in NEA (Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs), because they
                    knew a lot of the terrorist groups and kind of knew the situation and the
                    background.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>And for Population, Refugee, and Migration, it was a time to get ready for this
                    big UN conference. That was not the one on women, but the one prior to that, the
                    Cairo Population Conference, which would probably be a good place to start next
                    time and to start with how that whole thing happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Okay. Well, the next time we'll pick this up,

                <p>LOAR: I got involved in this conference in the last few months of it, starting in
                    June of 1994. And this conference was one of a series of UN conferences that
                    focused on a range of social issues. This one was an international conference on
                    population and development, and it had generated a lot of controversy because it
                    focused on hot button issues, particularly reproductive rights and abortion. And
                    it really brought out the groups, both sides of the issue with countries on both
                    sides of the issue. It was really quite a huge controversial event, and promised
                    to be a real controversial event, because all the buildup to it was, “the way
                    the UN Conference is going is that there's a great deal of preparation,
                    preparatory meetings in different regions of the world, and a lot of
                    negotiating, even in New York prior to wherever the conference is held.” And my
                    involvement in coming into it in June was to look at some of the issues on
                    organizing how the U.S. participates in these conferences as preparation for my
                    work later on in the Women's Conference, which was to be a year later in
                    Beijing, China, which was, you know, not on this issue, but on a broader range
                    of issues.</p>
                <p>It was a terrific experience to see how these UN conferences were run: what
                    happens during them; who stages what protests to get themselves arrested to make
                    the U.S. embassy have to dish them out of jail; what alliances different
                    countries were forming; how the U.S. incorporated the non-governmental
                    organizations' representatives onto U.S. delegations, how you managed this
                    disparate group of delegates who are from inside the government - experts on a
                    whole range of issues, including education and health care, and then people from
                    outside of the government who were experts as well, but not necessarily within
                    the government context. So it was a very interesting group to work with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this go smoothly or was it awkward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think that a big part of U.S. participation, when Tim Wirth was the
                    Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs, was leading the efforts for the U.S.
                    involvement in this conference. He had a real interest in bringing NGOs into the
                    process; and I think it was a lasting contribution that he made to the U.S.
                    government. It spilled into the State Department, because he really opened up
                    the doors in the State Department to NGOs. The State Department didn't like it
                    one little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They didn't like the idea the NGOs were coming in for large meetings. They
                    didn't like it that NGOs were serving on delegations. It was particularly
                    complicated as this was such a hot button issue, and it was an issue that
                    people, you know good people, can come to their own decisions about and can
                    disagree on. So it was a very challenging set of issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>And the Clinton administration's point of view was supporting free access for
                    women all over the world to family planning, and to be able to determine the
                    number, the timing, and the spacing of their children. That was something that
                    was a clear policy, and shaped a lot of the U.S. government's participation in
                    the conference. Of course, that got misinterpreted by many who said that it was
                    promoting abortion or some who saw it as not going far enough. They were a huge
                    domestic issue - abortion and reproductive rights, and you put it in the UN
                    context, and it's a really potent mix. But it drew members of Congress who were
                    very concerned about the issue.</p>
                <p>There were others who were very concerned about just placing women at the center
                    of development. That was another U.S. goal: looking at empowering women and
                    strengthening women's roles within the families; and then that became another
                    issue - what a family is. And we had some very strong involvement by the Vatican
                    in this, and the Vatican working with and reaching out to all kinds of Islamic
                    countries, who you wouldn't think would be on the same side as the Vatican on
                    any issue, which was surprising to me!</p>
                <p>It was a real brew of domestic politics brought onto the UN stage. I thought my
                    participation was helpful, because it helped me to see and to manage this set of
                    issues. While we had much broader issues coming up in the Beijing Conference, it
                    was helpful to see some of the very successful and smart things that were done,
                    and to look at some of the things that pose particular challenges that would
                    need to be addressed the next time around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular piece of this, or were you
                        bouncing all over the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I was coordinating our participation (kind of broadly defined). It
                    was just at the very beginning and I was not looking at what our policies and
                    positions were, but at how the delegation came and stayed together. There was a
                    terrific Foreign Service officer, Warren E. Littrel, a great guy, who was the
                    Admin counselor in Cairo, who did a tremendous job of providing a terrific place
                    for the U.S. delegation, and who set up a wonderful system for the U.S.
                    delegation to operate with there. I was on the sidelines and wasn't involved in
                    the policy.</p>
                <p>But there was another thing. We were really determined to provide public NGO
                    briefings every day of the U.S. delegation, because we were trying to set up a
                    model of transparency and openness, so that NGOs who were not on the delegation
                    and who wanted to know what the U.S. was doing could hear very directly from the
                    delegates who were in the rooms. This was also hard as the UN didn't have a
                    practice of doing this, and frowned on it, frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, you sort of messed up the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. They weren't keen on openness. So that was another thing the U.S.
                    pushed hard on, and I think it's also a lasting - nothing's lasting. But an
                    important contribution I think the U.S. made in its participation in these
                    conferences was in valuing NGOs, and bringing them in, and then also briefing
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any way of defining what's an NGO? I've
                        heard somebody who served in Kosovo say, to him an NGO was one person with a
                        suitcase full of pamphlets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, well, that could be. I never found that to be a particular issue -
                    whether they were valid NGOs or not. See, on these issues of family planning,
                    population, and family there were very well established, well funded groups on
                    both sides who would stop at nothing to make their points.</p>
                <p>Our ambassador to Cairo was Ned [Edward S.] Walker, who was very good, very
                    shrewd, and very smart. There was a demonstration that was held outside of the
                    gates with the purpose of getting the Egyptian government to arrest them, so
                    that they could then say they were being mistreated by the Egyptian government,
                    and force our embassy and our ambassador to have to go to work to get them out
                    of their situation, and members of Congress were encouraging that. It was just a
                    fascinating mix.</p>
                <p>I do remember Bella Abzug, who was on the U.S. delegation, and who did not want
                    to hold back on her point of view, particularly regarding the Vatican. I
                    remember there was a memorable public statement that she made in the UN meeting
                    rooms about the Vatican's views towards women. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Memorable, on the Vatican's views towards women. I laugh - But they're
                    words I can't even repeat, some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She wasn't in sync with them. They weren't on the same wavelength.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>LOAR: And I had known - everybody grew up knowing Bella Abzug. I actually ended
                    up sitting with her on a plane. She was really a very warm person too; that
                    wasn't really her public persona. But she was very warm, very dedicated to
                    standing up for women. Even if you didn't agree with her particular point of
                    view or with the way she expressed it, you couldn't help but be won over by her
                    real driving drive to help women be heard and break through channels, and to
                    really make sure that women's needs were on the agenda. No one has come along
                    who was like that within the UN system in the U.S. NGO community who has really
                    had an effect like that. She was really unique in that way, and it was
                    interesting having her on our delegation because she wasn't someone you
                    managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you find your Catholicism causing any problems
                        for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I have my own views on the issues that were formed before this
                    conference. I was dismayed at some of the Vatican's actions. I thought they were
                    irresponsible to be working with really outlaw Islamic countries, even if it
                    wasn't something they thought was deeply important. There were some members of
                    the Vatican delegation who were just not in a diplomatic mode, shall we put it.
                    Then there was this stellar member of the Vatican delegation, who's now an
                    archbishop, Diarmuid Martin, who is from Ireland, who is brilliant and charming,
                    and really focused on the social justice issues. Actually, he was a key
                    negotiator for Beijing as well. When Mrs. [Lindy] Boggs was our ambassador to
                    the Vatican more recently during the Clinton administration, I had an
                    opportunity to do some work with him on trafficking. He is really an interesting
                    person. One Foreign Service officer described him as the smartest diplomat he'd
                    ever met. He's just really stunning.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Vatican had some people who would scream and wave their
                    fingers at you from across the room, and would huddle with Sudan, Iraq, and
                    Syria, and tell them that the U.S. was trying to destroy families. That was
                    troubling to me. It was troubling to see some of those individuals, who were
                    actually American citizens working for the Vatican, do that. I thought that was
                    really bad form.</p>
                <p>It was also very interesting that the top people got involved. Phyllis Oakley,
                    who was newly appointed (no, actually not new, I don't think she was newly
                    appointed) as Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugee, and Migration, played
                    a huge role in this. Phyllis is this really capable, talented person, who is
                    well regarded at the State Department. So it was a great asset from Tim Wirth's
                    point of view to have Phyllis Oakley involved because she really brought a lot
                    of oomph to the issue, as well as institutional support. And I remember her
                    saying more than once publicly that she became a feminist in the course of this
                    conference when she saw the way some of these issues were being treated. Now
                    people can disagree on this issue, and either you can respectfully disagree or
                    you can disrespectfully disagree, but there are different sides of that issue.
                    But it was more than just the family planning and the abortion things. That
                    these two were pushed together, was also interesting to see.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating way to get into the whole UN conference thing. It made me
                    realize we were going to have a problem with the Islamic countries if we didn't
                    have someone on our delegation who was a Muslim, as well as a woman, who could
                    meet with the other delegations. We knew that at the time.</p>
                <p>And we also knew that we needed someone who would be seen as a real, active
                    Catholic - someone who wouldn't be messed with by those who wanted to
                    misrepresent our views. Well, this is looking ahead to Beijing, because Beijing
                    had reproductive rights as only one of ten issues, and there were some who were
                    looking for the chance to start that whole battle again. Al Gore came to the
                    conference, and he came in in the middle of these issues as well, and that was
                    very interesting. I haven't looked at my notes.</p>
                <p>I haven't looked at anything from that for such a long time. But I do remember
                    everyone got sick because it was Cairo, and it was heavily polluted. They were
                    also working late into the night, and the air conditioning was overwhelming. We
                    had these countdown meetings every day with the delegation. The delegates were
                    just a fascinating brew of the ones I said - people like Bella Abzug on the one
                    hand, and these really staunch, pro-choice health groups in our U.S. delegation.
                    Then you also had people from the government, who are used to working on health
                    policy or to working on issues related to equal pay, or something like that,
                    because lots of different parts of the docket were science issues. [laughter]
                    They were altogether in this delegation. It was a fascinating mix. Brian Atwood,
                    the head of AID was there as well, and I remember it was helpful to have him
                    involved. This was an interesting introduction to all of this for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it come out, as far as you were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think there were steps forward on putting women at the center of
                    development, and it laid the groundwork for a lot that was going to be done. It
                    was a very strong document that came out of Cairo. It's been misrepresented a
                    number of times, but I think the tremendous value of it was that it really did
                    look at some of the needs of women as individuals, within the family, within the
                    community, and at what countries should be doing, and at what governments should
                    be doing. While it did focus a great deal on women's health needs, it also
                    looked at issues of violence, and female genital mutilation, and issues like
                    that, which weren't being talked about in any significant way. So much of it was
                    pushed over to the side because of the controversy about family planning. The
                    same with family planning, which I thought was stunning because I think a
                    majority of Americans supported the idea of family planning here in the United
                    States. Yet by lumping it with abortion, they were taking that away from women
                    in other parts of the world, and I didn't think most Americans would support the
                    idea that women in developing countries shouldn't have access to family
                    planning. But this debate goes on, as we can see. There are family planning
                    funds being withheld from poor women all around the world now because of the
                    misrepresentation that it's used to promote abortion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, however, that with the focus on family
                        planning, and with the real controversy having moved over there, that you
                        were able to get through other things on the agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Ah?that was the overwhelming issue. I'd have to look to see what else was
                    being looked at in some of the other issues: there were inheritance rights being
                    discussed and there was real controversy with some of the Muslim countries on
                    that issue; some of the work on violence against women wasn't really
                    controversial, but it wasn't really front and center either; educational needs
                    of girls, and then, of course, you got into parental rights, which is another
                    fun area to look at too - what rights do children have, what rights do girls
                    have - access to health education, or access to information about what they
                    might need for their bodies. Parents was another area - what is a family?, what
                    are parents? All sides were very eager to replay these in Beijing, and were just
                    warming up to let that happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did gay rights move into the thing at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think there might have been a little bit of language on that,
                    “related to sexual rights” was that code phase. The U.S. position there was
                    tolerance, and nondiscrimination, which was also, I think, a fairly mainstream
                    American value, and it's even more so now, I think. Our country's made some
                    progress in that area, but this is 1994, and it wasn't some moronic or bizarre
                    idea. I don't remember this issue in Cairo, to tell you the truth, because my
                    memories of Cairo are a lot less clear than my memory of what happened in
                    Beijing. I remember in Beijing having the positions extremely distorted as to
                    what the U.S. was trying to do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Theresa, the Beijing Conference on what, Women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women; it was the fourth
                    in a series of conferences on women that had gone back 10-15 years before
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the impetus for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, in the '90s, there was this series of conferences looking at a range
                    of global or social issues for the United Nations; they were all set in motion
                    and scheduled at the same time. It started with Rio [Rio de Janeiro] . I should
                    back up, because that's when Al Gore and Tim Wirth formed this interest and
                    commitment to these UN conferences as a way to effect broad change and to really
                    bring governments together. I think those conferences served a very valuable
                    purpose. We had that Cairo Conference, and then in between we had the Conference
                    on Social Development. That was in Copenhagen, and that was an in-between
                    conference; and not to denigrate it or anything, but it was a little bit mushy.
                    Then you had the Women's Conference in Beijing, which was in September 1995; and
                    there was a lot of building up to that; and it was clear we were going to draw a
                    huge number of people. The fact that it was China who was having it, made it
                    another interesting element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What prompted the Chinese to get into this
                        conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, these UN conferences move around from region to region. For example,
                    it was Latin America's time to have a conference, so the Brazilian government
                    bid on it, and Rio became the place; and then when China stepped in and said
                    they wanted to do the UN Conference on Women, all the other countries in Asia
                    sort of backed off because you don't take on China. I truly think, and we know
                    this from very concrete information we received later on, the Chinese were
                    looking at this as an opportunity to show the world they could handle the
                    Olympics. They were moving blithely along to set up the NGO Forum in the
                    downtown of Beijing, and the UN conference right nearby.</p>
                <p>And then Li Peng went to Copenhagen, and saw at the Social Summit what NGOs were
                    and what they did, including one who threw some blood on him - I don't know how
                    they got that close to him, but this was the story - it could be one of these
                    stories. [laughter] But, he saw them - very active, vibrant NGOs that weren't
                    controlled by any of their governments; and he said, “Whose idea was this to
                    hold this UN conference in China. It's outrageous. We're going to have all these
                    wacko protesters, NGOs coming to our country. I want to know whose idea this
                    was.” And of course, it was duly reported to him that it was his idea.
                    [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>LOAR: So, the Chinese government made a decision to move the NGO part of the
                    conference from downtown, the NGO Forum, and put it out in the countryside, in
                    an open field with no facilities - just away from the conference, so that the
                    wild and crazy NGOs would be out in the countryside, down a road in Huairou that
                    was quite a bit away from Beijing, with no facilities, and just flat land and
                    dust - not a welcoming place to discourage the outsiders to come to. But you do
                    your UN piece in a very strong and effective way.</p>
                <p>My role was, really to look at all parts of it: what are the issues we were going
                    to look at, how do we reach out to Americans, how do we bring them in, who
                    should be representing us on the delegation, and how do we work with other
                    governments. It was really the whole piece of it. I had the opportunity to work
                    with the Chinese government on some of these issues of how our delegates would
                    be treated. I wanted the whole range of things.</p>
                <p>Of course we worked with Mary Ryan, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, on
                    Services for Americans. My good Foreign Service friend Dan Pacuda was in China
                    at the time, and he set up a site in Huairou, at the NGO Conference, for
                    American citizens who might need services; and he made of point of showing every
                    member of Congress who came by that he had done this, [laughter] because we were
                    sure that somebody was going to get in trouble with the Chinese government, and
                    we wanted to be very visible about being out there, and we wanted the Chinese
                    government to know too. And Dan was really smart in the way he handled this,
                    “Let the Chinese go; let our government know.” We had somebody on site ready to
                    step up to the plate for Americans.</p>
                <p>But pulling this all together, we had a number of negotiations with the Chinese.
                    I remember this very smart and savvy guy in the Chinese government, who was my
                    interlocutor on this, and who told me with a very straight face the reason they
                    had to move the non-governmental part from downtown Beijing to the countryside
                    was because the facilities in the soccer stadium where they were going to hold
                    the NGO Forum weren't suitable for women.</p>
                <p>So I said, “What do you mean? They don't have bathrooms?” I mean I can say that
                    word. “Do they have bathrooms? They don't have bathrooms!”</p>
                <p>“Well, they're just not suitable.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Wasn't this going to be one of the places you hold your Olympics?”</p>
                <p>“Well, they're just not suitable!” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>LOAR: So it was, I guess, women's bathroom needs that really kind of threw the
                    whole thing off. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I do remember when it was announced that they were moving it, they were
                    just complete clods about it. They were artless in the way they announced it.
                    They were taking this NGO conference and moving it from downtown and throwing it
                    out in the countryside. They announced it in the middle of a UN meeting that was
                    one of the preparatory meetings for the conference. So all of the activists from
                    all over the world were in New York for this meeting, and all these delegates,
                    and they announced it then! You know, they could have done it like a week later,
                    when nobody would be united as a group. So, of course, we made a very strong
                    statement about it. I put something together from our delegation to this UN
                    meeting [that] said, “This is an attempt to separate NGOs, and to deny them
                    access to the government, and to undervalue their role in building democracies,”
                    and all this stuff.</p>
                <p>This Chinese guy?and then I had to see him at a lunch later on, and I thought,
                    “Well, of course they would expect us to react to this ridiculous thing they're
                    doing! Their timing is atrocious!” And I have never had a conversation with
                    anyone in the diplomatic field like I had with this Chinese guy. He was just -
                    if he'd punched me in the nose, he would have - he was just sitting at this
                    restaurant and just eating! I mean his anger was just flowing across the table,
                    “How dare you do such a?”</p>
                <p>And I was just stunned. “Well, what did you expect us to say and to do? Your
                    timing, and your decision's a bad one. Your timing's atrocious. We're going to
                    react, and people are looking to us to react! 'What is the U.S. going to say
                    about this?'"</p>
                <p>So it was just a sidebar, an interesting element. And then later on, a couple
                    years later, I was in a meeting with Harold Koh, who was then Assistant
                    Secretary for Human Rights [Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human
                    Rights, and Labor], and I was asked to come meet with the Chinese delegation
                    that was here on human rights issues, and I was to talk about some of the
                    women's human rights issues, and this guy was across the table from me! But we
                    were so happy to see each other, because even though we did disagree and had a
                    great deal of confrontation, we knew each other [laughter], and we just had to
                    remember those many occasions we had to express our points of view about what
                    our government expected from their government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our delegation like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>LOAR: Oh, it was a fabulous delegation! And I have to go down the hall and get
                    you a picture. Then I'll remember who all...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm being shown a picture, which is full of smiling faces,
                        mostly female for obvious reasons, and very colorful;, and you want to talk
                        about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: This is the U.S. delegation in Beijing, and this was taken at the
                    ambassador's residence - I guess after the first few days of the conference. We
                    put together the delegation to really reflect the level of interest that
                    Americans had in the conference. This is the largest number of Americans who
                    ever traveled to any conference, any international meeting outside the U.S. A
                    big part of our efforts were to make sure that Americans had access to the
                    conference, and that their NGOs could get in; and we also wanted to include in
                    our delegations representatives of groups who had shown a lot of interest in
                    this work and in the issues.</p>
                <p>We had an incredibly interesting group: a number of people who were running for
                    office, ran for office later on, had run for office. Marjorie
                    Margolies-Mezvinsky, a former member of Congress from Pennsylvania, had a big
                    role at the conference; [pointing at delegates in the photo] here's Geri
                    Ferraro, who was a member of Congress and ran for the Senate later on; this is
                    Julia Taft, who became Assistant Secretary of Population, Refugees, and
                    Migration in the second half of the Clinton administration; and obviously,
                    Hillary Clinton, who had an incredibly large role to play, and who really put
                    the conference on the map; Madeleine Albright, who was our Ambassador to the UN
                    at the time and then went on to become Secretary of State; Bonnie Campbell, who
                    went to head up the Violence Against Women's Office at the Justice Department,
                    which was a new breakthrough; Madeleine Kunin, who was a former governor of
                    Vermont and then became an ambassador later on; Dottie Lamm, who ran for the
                    Senate in Colorado later on; Sister Dorothy Ann Kelly, who was a nun, who was
                    the head of the College of New Rochelle, and now a trustee of Georgetown
                    [University], but she was like a leader in women's education, especially low
                    income women, I'm just looking across the picture - there's a whole mix of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get a woman or women who represented
                        Islam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes; right here is Laila Al Marayati, a woman from California who was a
                    Muslim woman, and who Kathy Hendricks (who worked with us and was an important
                    part of our planning, and also worked in the government with us) had
                    recommended. Laila and her husband, Salam Al Marayati, were very active in
                    California in interreligious issues. So she was well respected by her own
                    community, but also knew how to work with and was very good at representing
                    Islam and Muslim issues to other people of other faiths. She was also involved
                    in a number of issues related to the rape of women in Bosnia. She was a Muslim
                    woman in Bosnia; she was involved in that. So she was terrific, just a lovely
                    person, she educated a lot of us on the delegation about Islam, but also was
                    really terrific in meeting with the other delegates. She was a mother of two, a
                    doctor, and had a very busy life; but she devoted a lot of attention and time to
                    this. She was tremendously effective, because she'd come back to say, “You're
                    not going to believe,” and I have to say, “This is what the Vatican delegation
                    is telling the Islamic delegates about the U.S.! They're saying that you're
                    encouraging teenage girls to run off and marry and be with older men, and
                    encouraging girls to leave their families, and encouraging them to be lesbians
                    and not be with their families,” and all these things that nobody in their right
                    mind would believe. But yet one particular Vatican delegate who was an American,
                    was then put up for a position in this administration [sigh] - it didn't go
                    forward though. When this person was representing these views to the Islamic
                    delegations, especially to those in the Arab countries, what Laila was able to
                    do was to speak frankly, to say, “Look! I'm a Muslim woman,” and because she was
                    very well regarded in her own community, she was able to set the record
                    straight. She was just a really good diplomat for representing the U.S. views,
                    which is what every delegate's supposed to be.</p>
                <p>And then of course having Sister Dorothy Ann Kelly, a Catholic nun, on the
                    delegation, who was a leader in education, was helpful.</p>
                <p>We had Tom [Thomas] Kean, who was a former Republican governor of New Jersey, who
                    was terrific. He had said a very memorable thing when he was on CNN (Cable News
                    Network) one day. He said, “Wall (Well), it just seems to me that...” (he was
                    the governor of New Jersey, but he had a New England accent [laughter], the guy
                    is still extremely well regarded in New Jersey, my home state.) “what we're
                    talking about here is giving women the same rights that men have always enjoyed,
                    and I don't see anything radical about that.” And he was just really terrific,
                    and steadfast, and a great support on trying to calm things down and to bring
                    focus to the central issues, which was valuing women and girls, and trying to
                    bring these issues onto the agendas of government.</p>

                <p>LOAR: Well, from the very beginning her office was being contacted by people who
                    wanted her to play a role and to make sure that the U.S. was well represented
                    and doing what they should do in bringing important, serious issues to the
                    conference. There were school teachers, accountants, and all these women's
                    associations - not those necessarily on issues of women, but women accountants,
                    teachers, school principals - all contacting her office, and pushing to say,
                    “This is a big conference, and we're sending someone. We're organizing to send
                    someone from our eastern district, and we want to make sure?” So there was a lot
                    of pressure on her office, because she was the place in the U.S. government,
                    there on the political scene, where there was interest. She had expressed some
                    interest in issues for women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that the thrust of this was to, essentially
                        - and this sounds condescending; I don't mean it to - but to bring parts of
                        the other world and America up to at least where we are as far as treating
                        women; or was it to really meant to do things within America, using this
                        to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was being part of this conference that brought together women from
                    all parts of the world who shared similar issues and similar concerns. In our
                    country we had just gotten the Violence Against Women Act passed, a breakthrough
                    piece of legislation that was fairly unique in the world. That was passed in '94
                    - '95 [1994], somewhere along there. So now we were setting up an office in the
                    Justice Department -the first country in the world to have something within the
                    justice ministry for violence against women. So that was really a breakthrough.
                    So there was much to be shared with other countries on that.</p>
                <p>But there were other countries that had really done a much better job of helping
                    and supporting families throughout their lifespan, and there was much we could
                    learn on that end. So it was really to engage (and I know this sounds like
                    UNspeak) but just to engage in partnership with these other countries.</p>
                <p>We spent a lot of time and a lot of effort on how we projected ourselves - how we
                    presented ourselves, not just in the speeches that Hillary made, and not just in
                    the public statements the delegates made, but in how we represented ourselves
                    and how we engaged in the preparatory meetings prior to these conferences and in
                    the public meetings that we had across the United States to prepare for this
                    conference. It really brought people into the process.</p>
                <p>There was just a tremendous, unprecedented interest in Americans in this
                    conference, and there was no real mechanism for how to respond to this. That's
                    why this conference secretariat was set up. The Department of Labor was doing
                    some of these regional meetings across the country and people wanted to go. They
                    were really interested in going to China, you know.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>I have an assistant down the hall, a young woman who worked with me a couple
                    years later. I never met this person at the conference. I heard about her later
                    on. She was a college student, and she got the money together, and against her
                    dad's best wishes, went to China for this conference. She didn't have the right
                    kind of visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess, in a way, this is part of the unintended
                        consequences for the Chinese. Because the conference was being held in
                        China, it helped attract a lot of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, an interesting place!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but once they were there they got engaged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. So to respond to the interest of American women, we wanted to really
                    show we were taking this seriously. But, we were also really ginned up by
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I would go to my son's soccer game, and there would be women on the
                    sidelines, and I'd say, “What're you working on?” They'd say, “Our temple is
                    sponsoring two people to go.” And everybody had somebody, I know I was living in
                    that world that seemed like that, but it was just really like all over the place
                    that people were really drawn to this and interested.</p>
                <p>And then the international community. Because of the Cairo buildup, there was
                    this, “What is the U.S. going to do at this conference?” We were working very
                    hard to take the gains that were made in Cairo and some of the very good things
                    that had come out of that and to use that as a base for some of the other things
                    that needed to be addressed. Violence against women was the huge overwhelming
                    issue that people were pushing for discussion of, talk about. Whether it was in
                    the UN meetings or in the NGO Forum out in Huairou, there was this real interest
                    in coming togetheand in how we were addressing this, and in how we were doing
                    this. Bonnie Campbell, who I mentioned, who was the former attorney general of
                    the state of Iowa, and was the first person appointed as director of the
                    Violence Against Women Office at Justice Department, was like a rock star at
                    this conference, because there was no one like her in the world who had a
                    position in the federal government, in charge of implementing a law, which
                    didn't really exist elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain for the people who are going to be
                        reading this, how would you define, as we saw it at this time, violence
                        against women?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>LOAR: The whole range of issues, whether it's domestic violence, rape, sexual
                    assault, or stalking, it's all in the law. It's the law that Senator [Joseph]
                    Biden [Democrat from Delaware] had a huge role in getting passed, and more
                    recently, that Connie [Constance] Morella, my congresswoman from Maryland, had a
                    huge role in getting reauthorized. It also put a big chunk of money on the table
                    for states and local governments to work with the police, prosecutors, and
                    judges, and to implement the law. So it was a lot of work, and a lot of
                    resources, and a huge commitment - a major step forward on this issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we using our law and sort of passing out copies of it
                        to??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Not necessarily. I don't think we expected to, when we got to this
                    conference. We were not working internationally as a government, broadly
                    connecting with other governments, on women's issues at this time.</p>
                <p>So in preparing for the conference, we were exchanging ideas. We heard what
                    Australia was doing, or Chile, and others; it was all very interesting. But
                    really, the focus was on language and doctrine. It wasn't like we have a law,
                    and you have a law. No one went to this conference thinking, “Okay, they're
                    going to be looking for this.” No one quite knew the mindset of the global
                    community on these issues, and it was something you learned when you got
                    there.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing was that there were some who chose to present this
                    conference as “the Western feminists forcing their ideas onto women from other
                    countries.” I actually sat in Cardinal O'Connor's residence with some senior
                    members of our delegation, and I believe Madeleine Albright was there, and I
                    don't remember who else. There was a cardinal there and a few bishops, including
                    a bishop from New Jersey, who was on the Vatican's delegation, and who was a
                    particularly closed-minded individual. He said, “Look! These New York feminists
                    can't tell women in the other parts of the world what to do.” And I just
                    remember thinking, “How could you walk around that conference and think that New
                    York feminists are going to tell those other women from other countries what to
                    do? Have you sat down to negotiate with them?”</p>
                <p>And I was particularly thinking about the women from the African delegations, who
                    at the very last preparatory meeting before the conference blew the document
                    wide open saying, “Yes, there's something we forgot to mention,” or “There's
                    something we've been trying to get in here for a long time, and you're not
                    listening to us, and let me tell you we're not going anywhere without it.” All
                    the African delegations came together and said, “You have to add something on
                    girls.” So it was called “girlchild” in typical UN language. So the needs of the
                    girlchild became an added element, which sounds like nothing. But it just blew
                    it wide open, and it was because the African delegates said, “If you do not
                    start at that age, then if they don't have access to health, and education, and
                    everything else at that age, and if they're not free from violence, they won't
                    make it to be women. The patterns are set then. They won't ever be able to make
                    their contributions and to have that kind of life.”</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>So it was a fascinating thing; and I remember thinking, “How?Are we walking
                    around in the same meeting room at the UN?” But it was this condescending
                    attitude that, if only Bella Abzug and the New York feminists would go away, all
                    these demands for living free from violence, and having access to family
                    planning, and being able to have access to vaccinations and education, all these
                    annoying things would go away; if only the New York feminists weren't requiring
                    it. Now it was a stunning point of view, but I was glad to see that, because it
                    drove a lot of the public statements ever made from those who opposed the very
                    idea of the conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it reflected itself quite recently in the sex
                        scandals of the Catholic clergy messing around with alter boys and all this,
                        which had been buried for probably centuries; and all of a sudden it had
                        blown up. Again, the bishops didn't really understand. They didn't get
                        it!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, it was just a stunning closed-mindedness, and “we know better
                    than they do,” and “who are they to tell us,” without really opening and
                    listening to what these women from other countries were saying they needed and
                    understanding who they were representing. This was the very kind of people that
                    Christ stood up for and the kind of people the Catholic church and the Pope
                    would speak about.</p>
                <p>There was an interesting thing that the Pope did before this conference. He sent
                    a letter to the women of the world, which was a beautiful document. He actually
                    mentioned violence against women, because there were some issues with some in
                    the church, none on the Vatican delegation necessarily, but in other parts of
                    the world that if you really tackled this issue, when you get at it, you're
                    talking about domestic violence, and if you're talking about domestic violence,
                    at some point there may be a need for people to leave the family for safety
                    reasons. So there were some on the Latin American delegations that said that you
                    were really breaking up families when you were addressing this issue of domestic
                    violence. But the Pope in his letter to the women of the world, it was really,
                    actually, a beautiful statement about the value, and he actually got at violence
                    against women, but didn't say domestic violence. So that was an interesting
                    thing that he was really doing. And, ahead of this conference, he was
                    recognizing this was an important meeting going on. I always say it must have
                    been this Irish diplomat Archbishop Martin who was responsible for that because
                    it was a very forward-looking statement. [Laughter] Of course the delegation
                    wasn't necessarily guided by those lofty ideals all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Just going back to what our delegation was trying to do: we spent a lot of time
                    talking about the range of issues affecting women's lives, and what the goals of
                    this conference were, why we were going, and why Hillary Clinton was expressing
                    an interest in going. Of course she didn't really announce it right at the
                    beginning there because there was such a flashpoint; but it was to represent
                    America's interests and to have the U.S. engaging internationally on a whole
                    range of these issues. It was important that we be part of these discussions,
                    because it was China, and because there were these complicated issues related to
                    reproductive health, which were still on the table. There had been no change
                    from the Cairo conference, and those who lost there wanted to win, and those who
                    felt they didn't win enough, wanted to win more. Then there was another whole
                    set of other issues that came up. There were just real red herrings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This conference took place I've got from the 4th to the
                        15th of September 1995.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work once you got on the ground? I mean the
                        NGOs were off to one side, out in the field -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, and there were some NGOs who were credentialed to be around the
                    conference as well. But a lot of NGOs didn't care about the conference. They
                    wanted to get together with women from other parts of the world and to work. I
                    mean there were like 600 nuns who gathered. You know, I love telling that story.
                    [Laughter] And I think I saw every one of them. The largest number of people did
                    come from the U.S. because we have more means than most countries. The second
                    largest number of NGOs who came, came from Japan. Large numbers of them were
                    from all over Asia.</p>
                <p>The NGOs represented a whole range of activities. So there was the disabilities
                    tent; that actually became a point of real solidarity, because there was no
                    means for disabled people to get around the conference because it was really
                    muddy fields, and of course it rained the entire time, and so the people in
                    wheelchairs had a very difficult time getting around. So it became an issue of
                    how to get people access, and that became, I think, an issue that came to the
                    fore, when it hadn't been fully addressed before.</p>
                <p>An interesting thing happened when Madeleine Albright went out to the NGO Forum
                    in Huairou: she was asked to speak to the Americans. So there was a North
                    America tent, and everyone assumed she would go there. But she had heard about
                    the difficulties that the women in wheelchairs were having, and she said, “Let
                    me go to the disabled tent, and everyone can meet me there, because I don't want
                    to have those women in wheelchairs not be able to hear and I want to have a
                    chance to talk with them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was a beautiful statement, and it was a great moment because it, I
                    think, put everybody of the mind that, “Gee, you know, this is what she's doing.
                    Let's all sort of take a look at that.”</p>
                <p>But when we got there, it was huge issues related to the UN, who was running at
                    the UN conference, and who was providing protection around the parameters and
                    the outside of the conference. The UN is supposed to be responsible for security
                    of the site, but they were ceding the ground to the Chinese who were blocking
                    journalists and NGOs from going into certain rooms. So that fell to the U.S.,
                    who played a huge role in standing up to the UN on that. And those were some
                    interesting conversations, but we did prevail. Boutros Boutros-Ghali did not
                    come to the conference, which was a stunning blow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was?I mean -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Stunning, because it was the largest UN conference ever, and he fell
                    ill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he had to be impressed with so many, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, if he had been there, he would have had to be responsible for
                    standing up to the Chinese, and that wasn't in his interests since he was going
                    to be seeking his second term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah!!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But the timing of this conference too, and this is kind of all over the
                    place. But we had this office at the State Department, and there was a real
                    interest in NGOs knowing what was happening. So we held monthly public briefings
                    in one of the public buildings here [in DC]. You didn't even need security
                    clearance to get in; you were just able to go in - I think it was at OPM (Office
                    of Personnel Management); at that time anybody could walk in and come into the
                    big conference room there, the big theater. We held public briefings every month
                    because we wanted to be open. This was a carry over from Tim Wirth's concept of
                    how to bring NGOs in and be open with them, and this is a very interesting idea.
                    Of course the State Department didn't want the briefings in that building; how
                    would we ever get over there. But that was okay for us, because it was an open,
                    easy place for people to get to.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>So we would do these meetings every month, and every month you'd have another
                    issue on the table where it'd be annoying things like, “Well, how do I know what
                    clothes I should bring?” I was like, “We are not your travel agents.” There was
                    also, “I can't get the forms filled out,” and “I want to be credentialed.” So we
                    would actually assign people. You know, Senator Helms had a whole set of groups
                    who shared his views about these UN conferences, which was not on the supportive
                    side, that were having the same difficulty getting their forms filled out to get
                    credentials. We had a terrific staff member, Jeff Meer, who would sit down with
                    Senator Helms's staff and these groups to help them fill out their forms, so
                    they could come and beat us up at the conference. “But that is the way we're
                    doing this.” It's like, “You're an American. You should be part of this
                    conference, too.”</p>
                <p>So we really made a point of doing this. We held these open meetings where we'd
                    brief them, and I had people come up to me and say, “Why are you so anti-family”
                    and I'd say, “You know, that's kind of a broad question, but in fact, I'm not.
                    Why don't you come in and talk with me later on,” and they'd come in, and I'd
                    show them pictures of my sons in their soccer uniforms, and my brothers and
                    sisters and say, “Actually, I'm not anti-family. And the U.S. delegation is not
                    anti-family.” And then the next time, at the next briefing, they'd stand up and
                    say, “Now that I know you're not anti-family?” But my idea was to bring them in,
                    and just talk with them, and perhaps give them less of a chance to misrepresent
                    what you're doing and why you're doing it.</p>
                <p>But there was just a whole range of groups. There were youth who wanted more
                    youth issues involved, and there were people who hated China, “Why are we going
                    to China.” Actually in the course of this, Harry Wu went into China and got
                    arrested a month before we were supposed to leave for China. Therefore, it meant
                    all the leadership of the House, plus those who had the strongest views about
                    U.S. family planning and abortion policies, wrote to the president to say, “I'm
                    sure Mrs. Clinton, your wife, is not going to be going to this conference now
                    that Harry Wu has been arrested and is being detained by the Chinese, because
                    you would just be playing right into their hands.” This is at the same time the
                    U.S. had just renewed the most Favored Nation status for China. So it was okay
                    to trade with them; it was just a problem to send women there to talk about
                    democracy and all those ideas. It was a really interesting political stew.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>There were hundreds of summer interns in Washington at the time. Our office was
                    just getting so many requests for people to fill in the interns in Washington,
                    and tell them that this really cool thing was happening. So we went to the State
                    Department, and Ashley Maddox, a young person who saw no bounds, set up a
                    briefing for all the interns in Washington to come hear Hillary Clinton talk
                    about what the U.S. goals were at this conference. So, we held it, working
                    closely with Hillary's office. Melanne Verveer, who's in the picture here, who
                    was Hillary's deputy chief of staff, and I worked very closely then. The idea
                    was to have Mrs. Clinton come over, and just talk about the conference, why it
                    was important, and what we were doing. And of course it was Hillary Clinton. It
                    was all the Dean Acheson Auditorium and all of Loy Henderson Auditorium flow
                    over. So there were, I don't know, hundreds, maybe 500. Having gotten the White
                    House all on board, they were really rocking and rolling. Then we got a call
                    from Maura Harty in the Secretary's office, who I knew well and just had a great
                    relationship with, “Theresa, I hear Secretary [Warren] Christopher got wind of
                    the fact that Hillary Clinton's coming over to the State Department.” I said,
                    “Yea, yea! She's going to do a briefing for interns!” She goes, “Well, would you
                    want to have run that by us up here in the Secretary's office? That would have
                    been good for us to know.” [Laughter] Of course we worked it all out and
                    everything else.</p>
                <p>Then Harry Wu went into China and got arrested just days before the briefing was
                    supposed to happen, and we had hundreds of interns ready to come into the
                    building! So we ended up not making it a briefing on the Beijing Conference and
                    what Hillary was going to do at the conference. Instead, it was a report on her
                    trip to South Asia. But the level of interest in what was going on was just
                    overwhelming. It was just not something the State Department is really
                    structured to respond to.</p>
                <p>And then there were all the international issues and the intelligence issues, and
                    the Chinese were denying Americans visas. They would not give Americans visas,
                    and we knew later that it was a real concerted effort; and the UN organizers at
                    the conference were part of this effort: not giving forms out to Americans that
                    they would need to go out to Chinese consulates; Chinese consulates were
                    refusing Americans visas right and left, so Americans would go - this is how
                    motivated people were - they'd go from city to city to find a Chinese consulate
                    who'd give them a visa. I mean it was just a huge, huge effort. So we had all
                    kinds of things that we had to deal with: Americans' interest, how to work with
                    other governments, who were our allies, and what were the key things that we
                    were going to focus on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you able to go to the Chinese? I mean the
                        people you were talking to said, “You're really screwing things up!”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, yes. Many levels. We had Win [Winston] Lord, the Assistant Secretary
                    of East Asia/Pacific there. Actually, was he there, or was he over at the NSC
                    (National Security Council)? I forget where he was, but he was engaged in this.
                    But I have to say, frankly, there was very little enthusiasm from anyone in our
                    government, other than our little office and Mrs. Clinton's office, for the U.S.
                    participation in this conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The NSC found it to be rather distasteful and annoying. EAP (Bureau of East
                    Asian and Pacific Affairs), thought it wasn't in their interest and, “Gee, what
                    was the point of this because we had a relationship with China. Why are we doing
                    this? Why do this?”</p>
                <p>But the reality is we didn't choose this conference, and we didn't choose China
                    as our site, and this was the moment in time when Americans are very interested
                    in these issues. They wanted us to engage; they were going to this conference,
                    and we had an opportunity to really work with other people in other parts of the
                    world, and build some consensus around these issues. It would have been a
                    stepping back from the leadership responsibility if we hadn't gone; I think, we
                    had to do it. But we weren't really popular. Many people just thought we were
                    this place over there, and nobody wanted to share any intelligence with us or
                    tell us anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they ever use the term “pushy women?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I was a Foreign Service officer; I was one of their people in the
                    building; I wasn't some outsider. It wasn't really “pushy women.” It was this
                    inept - it was much more looking down on, “you really don't know what you're
                    talking about; you don't really know your way around the UN.” Well, we really
                    did by then, because you go to several preparation meetings, and you know all
                    the delegates, and you know that the same delegates will go from meeting to
                    meeting, and you know who's going to be doing what.</p>
                <p>The relationship with China was, you know, there were a lot of different things
                    going on. But we didn't ask Harry Wu to walk into China and get arrested, and
                    that was a very carefully timed thing, and meanwhile this train was moving down
                    the track. Was the U.S. going to stay home? There were a number of women's
                    organizations who thought that, and then supporters of Hillary said she
                    shouldn't go, because it's not going to turn out well, and she shouldn't expose
                    herself to this kind of possible condemnation or failure. So with no real
                    institutional support in the U.S. government, and yet a lot of interest from
                    NGOs and a lot of interest internationally in the U.S. engaging, she did make a
                    decision to go, and it was a huge, powerful thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>Her speech in Beijing was a beautifully written speech. Patrick Tyler of the New
                    York Times said it was the strongest statement by any high-ranking or high-level
                    VIP (Very Important Person) American on human rights issues in China. She
                    delivered a stronger, more direct message to the Chinese on human rights than
                    anyone had ever done before. At the same time, she really gave voice to a whole
                    range of women's human rights issues that now everyone understands and knows,
                    but had never been described as human rights issues.</p>
                <p>The human rights community, even human rights organizations in the U.S.,
                    dismissed these ideas of dowry burning, female genital mutilation, and violence
                    against women. Those were not human rights issues; those were about something
                    else. I got a lot of discussion with the human rights folks over at the NSC on
                    “how Mrs. Clinton really didn't understand human rights, and this was really
                    going to be a problem for us.” It was just a huge breakthrough.</p>
                <p>Standing in the balcony and watching her deliver her speech was a very moving and
                    unforgettable scene, because looking around the room you had delegates from
                    India, from Thailand and Africa and men and women - primarily womedelegates, all
                    packed in this hall. When she talked about dowry burnings in India, the Indian
                    delegations would jump to their feet; and then she'd talk about something, a
                    practice that was common in Africa, and the African delegates, with their
                    beautiful outfits and head ribbons, would stand up and speak; and when she
                    talked about human rights abuses in China, including those that took away the
                    rights of the individual and their family to decide the number and spacing of
                    children, including forced family planning, Chris [Christopher] Smith, a
                    congressman who I grew up with, and who was really opposed to U.S. participation
                    in the conference, jumped up and applauded her. So Clinton's speech was a real
                    strong statement that “women's rights are human rights, and human rights are
                    women's rights.” This had been a concept moving around in the NGO community and
                    the women's rights community, but she really brought the attention of the world
                    to this conference and to these issues. It was very, very powerful, and moving,
                    and exhausting; but, it was a great moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel in the aftermath that the agenda had changed
                        in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I think it had a profound effect. I know it has had a profound effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Violence against women and other things like that are not
                        part of the agenda.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>LOAR: I think the Beijing Conference had a huge effect in policy development. I
                    think it was a watershed event that led to a number of things. A year later I
                    was in a senior position at the State Department focusing on women's human
                    rights and foreign policy. So I was in a position to see what was happening in
                    other parts of the world as follow-ups to this conference and to stay in touch
                    with a number of the delegates and ministers for women, and ministers in other
                    areas that I had worked with. And, our embassies were starting to do some
                    reporting; and also all the ministers for women of other countries and delegates
                    I had worked with would come in to see me. So I would regularly hear from people
                    what they were doing after this conference.</p>
                <p>At first, we had four interns in our office at this office at State, and they
                    were tracking the changes, and pulling down cables, and I found they were kept
                    fairly busy. Then, months went by, and you just couldn't keep track of all the
                    cables from the field, and you couldn't keep track of all the changes that had
                    been made since the conference. We stopped monitoring this because, for example,
                    in Latin America the women legislators formed a group, and they just would work
                    together across, all over, from one country to another in Latin America, to
                    strengthen the laws of violence against women, to criminalize rape, to
                    criminalize domestic violence, to set up new government policies on the issue of
                    violence against women. It was just if you track the legislation in Latin
                    America and how those countries deal with these issues, you can see right after
                    the Beijing conference from Panama to Chile, to Columbia, to Ecuador, what they
                    did, and how they used each other's legislative tools, and how they set up
                    police units in Brazil; and it was just a stunning, stunning series of
                    issues.</p>
                <p>And what it was was that if you had an interest in these issues as a legislator,
                    or a woman in government, or as an NGO, you had a consensus document from the
                    United Nations that was agreed to by 189 countries - a consensus document. Now
                    you may have pages of reservations from certain delegations, but it was
                    basically that violence against women is an impediment to development, violence
                    against women is human rights abuse, women should have access to a full range of
                    health care across their life span, and educating girls is a value to the
                    country, not just to the family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many of those things you might have reservations against,
                        but it's pretty hard to have reservations against violence against
                        anybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, well, if it breaks up families though, you have to look at the greater
                    good. But, now I wouldn't share that view -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but there were -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>LOAR: But there were some other countries who expressed that view. But in other
                    areas, I definitely think that the fact that there had been this huge
                    conferencing in Beijing, and this global discussion about empowering women, and
                    strengthening woman values, and the importance of families and communities in
                    growth of nations, for women and girls to be treated fairly and with some
                    justice. I think that dialogue, all of that, was still around a year later in
                    October of 1996 when the Taliban moved into the capital of Afghanistan, and said
                    that girls can't be educated, and women can't walk outside the home without
                    being accompanied by a male.</p>
                <p>I think, I know I wouldn't have been able to play the role I played, and I don't
                    think our government would have responded the way we did if we had not had this
                    conference ahead of time. It laid the groundwork, and that was happening in
                    capitals all over the world. It happened in Japan, and it happened in Australia,
                    and it happened in other countries where they were not going to recognize the
                    Taliban, because there were these new sets of issues now a year old on the
                    table.</p>
                <p>It was October '96, when the Taliban came in. The conference had been a year
                    before. It really laid the groundwork for countries saying, “Well, you know, you
                    really can't treat half of your population this way because they're basic human
                    rights. Girls should be educated. The world agrees to that. We all came together
                    and talked about the value of educating girls a year ago.” So it really laid the
                    groundwork for the U.S. and many other countries denying the Taliban a seat at
                    the UN and — just because they had control of the majority of their territory at
                    some point, had more guns than anybody else — not recognizing them as a
                    government. I know there were other issues, but it was one of the issues on the
                    table. So it had a really profound effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, this did. Oh, yes, this one, I think, caught the
                        attention more than anything else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More people against the Taliban. Well, what did you do
                        after the conference and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, right before the conference it was Women's Equality Day, the day that
                    women had gained their right to vote, August 26th. And we were thinking about
                    what happens when you get back from the conference. How do you carry this all
                    forward, because there was such a push, and such a drive now. Right after the
                    Africans sort of opened up the document to include a whole series of issues
                    around girls and girlchild, the Australians said, “And by the way, shouldn't all
                    countries come up with a series of commitments, what they're going to do
                    afterwards? Because now we know how these UN conferences work. You need
                    commitments.” So the U.S., and I were like “Thanks Australia! Another thing we
                    have to do to get ready for this conference.”</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>So then we had to have an interagency government working group for that. “Okay.
                    Labor, what do you have? And Justice? Okay. You need your Violence Against Women
                    Office. Okay. Labor, what do you have? HHS (Health and Human Services)? So we
                    tried to get a series of commitments, which we had to know were going to be
                    carried out. So we had to quickly put together, “What does the U.S. government
                    think it can do, knows it can do because we can't make these commitments; so get
                    all these things put on the front burner, pushed up to the line.”</p>
                <p>And one of the things we said we would do was to set up an interagency working
                    group to follow up on all the recommendations that came out of the conference,
                    and that's what we did. It was the President's Interagency Council on Women, and
                    it was announced by President Clinton a few weeks before we left for the
                    conference. And then we came back and that was the first thing to come up. We
                    set it up in the White House, and Hillary's office was very involved and very
                    interested. HHS was sort of funding our office. I was the director of the
                    council, and it was on that back picture over there. But that's for the next
                    time.</p>
                <p>But this was a really fabulous idea, and I guess it was; you come back from a
                    conference; you said you were going to do all these things. How do you set up a
                    mechanism to continue to work together as a government, bringing together
                    government agencies; and how do you set up something that allows you to work
                    with other countries and to respond to the NGOs in your own country. So it was a
                    combination of all those things together that kind of led to the Interagency
                    Council on Women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. So we'll pick this up for next time at about?'96 or
                        so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where we'll be talking about the time after the Beijing
                        Conference, and dealing with interagencies to put together a coherent

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, right. Okay.</p>

                <p>
                    <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there, the women's meeting in Beijing, you
                        went to the what, Interagency Council? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, a few months before we left for the Beijing Conference (the
                    conference was September 1995), the Australian government put this new idea into
                    the mix, and that is, that every country would have to come with a series of
                    commitments on what they would do to follow up. You know, we all thought it was
                    a great idea; but it was a big pain in the neck to us who were actually
                    organizing, because we then had to have a series of government commitments to
                    announce, and we wanted to announce things that we knew we could get done, and
                    we were trying to do it on an interagency basis.</p>
                <p>One of the things we wanted to do when we returned from this conference was to
                    have some follow-up mechanism, a coordinating body that would take the ideas
                    from the conference and build them into the way our government does work. So
                    President Clinton announced on Women's Equality Day on August 26, 1995, which
                    was the 75th anniversary of the women's right to vote, that on returning home
                    from Beijing, we would set up an interagency council. It would be called the
                    President's Interagency Council on Women. It would be a government task force of
                    high-level representatives of the federal branch, and they would carry on the
                    good ideas that came out of this conference. That was just a couple of weeks
                    before we left for the conference.</p>
                <p>We wanted to do that because there were NGOs who were pushing to set up a
                    government NGO body. There were some who wanted to set up an NGO body endorsed
                    by the government. I think our thinking in trying to set up a government task
                    force was government had responsibility for these issues. We wanted to make
                    government have responsibility for these issues. We knew we had strong
                    leadership with Hillary Clinton, who was willing to get behind it. We had Donna
                    Shalala, who was the cabinet secretary at HHS, who was going to be coming to the
                    conference and was very supportive. So we knew we had some of the wherewithal
                    and oomph within government to do it; and we didn't want to expose ourselves to
                    NGOs calling for an NGO commission; apparently there had been something along
                    those lines under President Carter. But we thought we didn't want to leave it to
                    NGOs to do the work or NGOs to advocate for what government should do because we
                    were really leading this, and we kind of knew what needed to be done. So we
                    wanted to see what we could put together. So the government task force was
                    announced, and it was set up, and we came back from the conference.</p>
                <p>I talked about the conference in the past - the largest gathering, the largest UN
                    conference ever, and the largest number of Americans who ever traveled to go to
                    a conference outside the U.S. or any international meeting.</p>
                <p>So we came back and there were great expectations.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>At the conference, Hillary Clinton delivered this extremely strong speech about
                    women's rights and human rights; it was very well received by the international
                    community, and by the Americans who attended. Madeleine Albright, who was our
                    U.S. Ambassador to the UN (and this was a UN conference), announced the
                    commitments, including this commitment that we'd set up this organizing body
                    within the government.</p>
                <p>So we came back, and we had to think about where this would be. Melanne Verveer,
                    who was Mrs. Clinton's deputy chief of staff at the time, knew there was a real
                    interest in really carrying this forward. She was very instrumental in helping
                    us set this interagency task force up over at the White House, and that would
                    mean that one agency had to sponsor it. HHS agreed to sponsor it, one way or
                    other. Donna Shalala became the chair of this task force, with Hillary Clinton
                    as the honorary chair. We had office space in the New Executive Office Building.
                    Some of the team who had been with me in preparing for the conference, like Jeff
                    Meer, who's a Foreign Service officer and who was a terrific human rights
                    negotiator and all around very capable Foreign Service officer, came over with
                    us; and Kathy [Kathleen] Hendrix, who had been appointed and had been key in the
                    office in preparing for Beijing. Kathy Hendrix had been an appointee to the
                    Clinton administration; she started as a speechwriter for Cliff [Clifton]
                    Wharton, who was the Deputy Secretary for a period of time; and then when we
                    were getting ready for Beijing and setting up this Beijing office to get ready
                    for the conference (the conference secretariat), she came on board; and Kathy
                    had been a reporter for the LA Times for 20 years; she had attended a previous
                    women's conference as she was a terrific writer and conceptual, able to think in
                    broad ways about women's rights and building this into what governments could be
                    doing; she came over. Lycia Sibilla, who's a Foreign Service spouse, and came
                    into the office before the Beijing Conference, and did terrific work with us at
                    the conference, she was also over with us.</p>
                <p>So we had the same crew who was getting ready for the conference then detailed
                    over to set up this post-conference interagency task force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had other issues too. I mean-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. So there were ten concrete issues that were the basis of the Beijing
                    Conference: violence, workplace issues, labor issues, health issues, education
                    for girls - the whole life span approach to needs that needed to be addressed,
                    with the whole idea that women's rights are human rights and putting women at
                    the center of development is sort of key for the progress of nations. That was
                    1995 and not a universally accepted idea by any means, but there was more direct
                    language in how to speak about it and how to tie it to the future of countries
                    and to country's development.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>And so this team, which helped put this together, came over; we opened up this
                    office at the White House, which was a lot of fun. In designing a logo, Lycia
                    Sibilla decided we should use the White House logo [laughter], which I loved, so
                    we had stationary cards, and everything else. We had to find furniture; we had
                    to build it, just like we had done before the Beijing Conference, like this was
                    our [laughter] destiny - to be entrepreneurs and set up offices, to set things
                    going, and to get people moving.</p>
                <p>And it was actually great fun because we were in the New Executive Office
                    Building. We had a trace of space in the Old Executive Office Building, which,
                    unless we did what Ollie North did - which was to build a second level of
                    offices within the office, which was not anything we were going to consider
                    doing - was extremely crowded and tight; and we would only have room for one or
                    two people. But we wanted this crew who we had been working with and who were
                    very committed to moving us forward. We knew we would want volunteers to come in
                    and help. We thought people from other agencies might want to come in, because
                    we were really trying to focus on what other government agencies could be doing
                    and to be working as a joint body to take some of these ideas and suggestions
                    for government action out of this conference. So it was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>We started by looking at the Beijing Platform for Action, which was a call to
                    action that was a consensus document (we were saying how hard it is to get
                    consensus, but that's the way the UN works), and had key strategies in the ten
                    important areas, calling for action in the basic guidelines. What the Beijing
                    Platform for Action was, was a roadmap for what governments could be doing, and
                    what the international community could do to improve the status of women, to
                    make women full partners in society and to give them full access to health, and
                    to bring them into the political mechanisms. It opened up the doors to taking
                    action against violence against womeand really looked at the whole set of needs
                    for women and girls. As I said before, the African delegations really insisted
                    on an emphasis on girls, and they were very, very successful in doing that.</p>
                <p>So we looked at this, and at the current government. We realized that there were
                    a number of high-level women appointees throughout the federal government under
                    President Clinton. What we really wanted was a decision maker, and this was
                    Kathy Hendrix.</p>
                <p>I was thinking about what this interagency council, this body, this taskforce
                    could be. Melanne Verveer, who was in the First Lady's office, was also key in
                    these discussions and looking at: what the taskforce was, and who we wanted from
                    an agency. We wanted someone who could deliver that agency; we want somebody who
                    cared about this issue and doesn't see this as a meeting to sit down with Donna
                    Shalala or Hillary Clinton, but was really a go-getter and really committed to
                    wanting to do this. And there was a series of sort of talking with who would be
                    the best representative. In some cases it was the Deputy Secretary, like at
                    Education: Madeleine Kunin was the Deputy Secretary of Education. She had been
                    at the conference; she had been at previous UN conferences and really obviously
                    had an ability.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had also been governor of -</hi>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But she also could deliver the agency. So, they were representatives, but
                    they had to bring with them people who could carry out things. It wasn't our job
                    to say, “Okay Education, here's the ten things you have to do.” Our job, what
                    Kathy Hendrix and I did, was to make house calls to the different
                    representatives and these agencies, and explain, “This is what came out of this
                    Beijing Conference.” Some were intimately involved, because they had been
                    involved from the beginning in planning for the conference. But, some agencies
                    didn't have representation at the conference and weren't part of the planning
                    process. Therefore, in some cases, it was explaining anew what we were trying to
                    focus on, like at Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, could you talk about some of the agencies
                        and how they felt about this, starting with the State Department. Were you
                        still a State Department representative or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I was actually. That was actually my title, State Department
                    Representative, though the other title was Director, because somebody had to be
                    in charge of this task force. You had your Chair, which was Donna Shalala, who
                    had come to the conference, and been very active in the preplanning, and very
                    committed to these issues throughout her career, but especially as Secretary of
                    Health and Human Services. Someone had to be the organizer and pull it together.
                    Kathy Hendrix was the associate director.</p>
                <p>We represented our agencies. However, as the State Department people had been the
                    organizers and had planned the conference before it took place, we had a broader
                    role afterwards; that is, since our government has made these commitments at an
                    international conference, we at State then had the responsibility for carrying
                    out those commitments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this a handy tool to use to beat people over
                        the head by saying, “Well, I'm sorry, but the government has committed to
                        it, so?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, being a diplomat, of course, one doesn't [laughter] hit anyone over
                    the head. What we did actually, we didn't make any? we wanted some maverick
                    group working outside of channels. I was a Foreign Service officer, and had the
                    additional advantage or burden (however you look at it) of 12 years of Catholic
                    schooling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So I was very conscious of hierarchy, and consensus, and bringing people on
                    board. Before we went to the conference, getting those commitments was a little
                    bit of a tough process. It was tough getting people to think big, broad and
                    bold.</p>
                <p>But there were people in these agencies who really wanted to do things. An
                    example was the Department of Justice. There was a new law, the “Violence
                    Against Women Act” that Joe Biden [Joseph R. Biden, Jr.] had been key in getting
                    passed. This new law, the Violence Against Women Act, was really landmark
                    legislation worldwide for looking at issues of violence against women. This was
                    the first time there was a federal government response to these issues, and as
                    far as I know, was the first anywhere in the world, to mandate that a new
                    office, the Violence Against Women's Office, be opened at the Department of
                    Justice and to build this into the criminal justice system and to get a criminal
                    justice system response. This is a very specific commitment. But we wouldn't
                    have announced this if there wasn't a law, and an office that was opening up,
                    and someone very dynamic and strong who was running that office who was
                    appointed by President Clinton - Bonnie Campbell, who used to be the attorney
                    general in the state of Iowa, and who worked closely with Senator Biden in
                    writing the law.</p>
                <p>So it wasn't hitting people on the head. For a lot of people who cared about
                    these issues, it was finding a way for them to push some of the things they were
                    working on from the back burner to the front burner, and to think broadly. “Okay
                    Department of Education, is there anything in the education area the U.S.
                    government could be announcing: education for girls, issues related to equity,
                    or other key issues in education. We're not the education experts, you are.
                    Okay. So what is it you would want to announce; but, don't give us anything to
                    announce that you can't follow through on.”</p>
                <p>So there are issues of microcredit, for example, at the Treasury Department.
                    There was an office focus on microcredit and microlending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what microcredit and microlending
                        are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's small loans, making small loans to people so that, and -</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially for business.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's for businesses and for income generating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And it's one of the great tools of development that was pioneered by
                    Mohammed Yunus in Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And is now a very universally recognized way to lift people up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It has a disproportionate benefit for women, because as the microlending
                    projects would start, women would pay back at a higher rate and would take the
                    money they would get from their investments and invest it in their families. So
                    those in development started looking at this as a great way to help people
                    generally, but specifically something that was particularly helpful to women, as
                    women would use it as a tool to move their families forward, to educate their
                    children, to feed their families, to get better access for health care.</p>
                <p>But within our Treasury Department, to have an office that's a community
                    development fund, I believe, and an office that was focused on microfinance and
                    microlending in the United States, was very important, because this was an idea
                    that was being used in and had gained a lot of interest in the international
                    development community. Actually, Hillary Clinton, when she was the First Lady of
                    Arkansas, had been very interested in taking some of these ideas and bringing
                    those to Arkansas. So I think there was strong support from the First Lady at
                    that time to have something within Treasury look at this and at how microcredit
                    and microfinance could be available and helpful to people in the United States
                    through the Treasury Department, which is a very interesting idea. So that
                    office made a commitment to announcing awards once a year for the best
                    microcredit projects in the United States. They were going to really encourage
                    the capital banks here in the United States to look at how to invest more in
                    these types of loans and to make more of these kinds of funds available to
                    people. So that was another very practical thing.</p>
                <p>And at the Labor Department?I'm trying to think of the best ones.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>At HHS, Health and Human Services, of course there were a lot of things on
                    women's health. One of them was looking at women and HIV/AIDS [human
                    immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], which in 1995 people
                    were looking at. It wasn't as prominent an issue as it is now, nor as prevalent.
                    Unfortunately, it is much more prevalent now. The incidence of HIV/AIDS in women
                    now is just about equal to that of men in new cases. So, there were some very
                    serious commitments from there.</p>
                <p>But it was the process, as I was saying beforehand, of getting people and
                    agencies to commit. It's diplomacy, but it was also that there was always
                    someone in some agency who really wanted to get things done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't having, in a way, to sell the product.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We were trying to elevate the product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Okay. So if somebody said, “Well, I could do?” “Yeah, it's really
                    interesting, but don't you have a bigger, higher, or more fabulous thing that
                    you would want the United States to be identified with - something really
                    important?” In some cases it was a cabinet secretary who grabbed for the biggest
                    thing. In some cases it came from mid-level.</p>
                <p>It came together though, and they were all doable, concrete things that the U.S.
                    government could announce. So the immediate job or task of this interagency task
                    force was to carry those out, and that would mean me, and I would go to
                    Education and say, “Okay, Education, you said you were going to do this. Let's
                    make sure it gets done.” But this wasn't like hitting people over the head. They
                    really wanted to do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But some of the agencies, like, for example, the Department of Agriculture
                    (Ag), hadn't been part of the planning. This was a great exercise and a fun
                    thing for me because I got to find out what every federal agency does. Even
                    though I grew up in New Jersey, the farm state, I didn't have much experience in
                    the agricultural area! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>LOAR: And so to find out what Ag does was a great revelation to me. They had huge
                    programs for welfare and feeding children in families. They had tremendous
                    numbers of loan programs. The representative who came on board from the
                    Department of Agriculture was Jill Long Thompson, who'd been a member of
                    Congress from Indiana. She was from a farm state, and she recently ran again. I
                    don't know if she won her election or not. I have to look to see. But she was
                    very dynamic and a statistician.</p>
                <p>So after Beijing, we went over to Ag and Kathy and I introduced ourselves and sat
                    down with Jill who had some of her team and her staff there and said “We're
                    going to do great things.”</p>
                <p>And I thought, “Ag didn't make a commitment at the time of the conference, but
                    let us look at and talk through some of the things that you think we could be
                    looking at, or let me tell you some of the things we're thinking about, and we
                    can think them through.” So we thought through these ideas with them. Kathy
                    Hendrix, in particular, had a great mind for thinkinfor what we call gender
                    mainstreaming now, which is looking at, how you bring women into the process of
                    developing policy, or how you look at policy and see how it affects women, so
                    that women get a fair share.</p>
                <p>Jill Long Thompson at that time was right in the middle of doing a major survey
                    to determine how the Department of Agricultural loan programs were working and
                    who they were serving. So they looked at who you have to talk to, and then at
                    what information we find out from this survey which told us that people said
                    they needed from the Department of Agricultural loan programs; and after talking
                    to us, she said, “Well, maybe I'll put a separate little line here that will ask
                    the person to identify their gender - male and female - and then also identify
                    whether they call themselves a farmer or not.” And she came back to us later on
                    to say, “We found we had certain assumptions about who the farmer was in the
                    family; and there may be a farming family, but often, in many cases, it was the
                    mother and the woman who was the farmer. Because the husband, because farming
                    wasn't as lucrative as it had been ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was at the factory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?he was off getting employment outside the family. So we found by doing
                    this survey that we were really talking to female farmers, and then what their
                    particular needs or interests were as far as not just loans, but also other
                    services that the Ag Department provides to people: distance learning, and
                    access to social services. So it was a fascinating example to us, and
                    particularly to me, where I didn't know agriculture from a hole in the wall.
                    However, here was this leader, one of the under secretaries at the Agriculture
                    Department, who took some of the ideas and concepts that came from this big UN
                    conference and decided to look at it in her own work. That was just the first of
                    many things that she would do.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>She was just such a go-getter. The council was filled with senior appointees like
                    this, most of whom were women. We had a couple guys from the NSC; we also had
                    someone from the State Department in addition to us. But we had these women who
                    had high-level appointments, who took some of these ideas and concepts, and now
                    had a mandate.</p>
                <p>See this is the fascinating thing! The interagency council, as we wrote the
                    announcement for the president to announce, was going to be a task force
                    designed to carry out the good ideas from this conference. Okay? So it was a
                    mandate from the President of the United States for people to take the ideas
                    from this conference and integrate them into their work. What does that mean?
                    Well, we sit down with people and we talk through these ideas of the conference;
                    we have a mandate which is important to have, and we convene. So you need, you
                    could call it pep rallies, which are also a way to bring people together to say,
                    “Look whats here, look what this person's doing!” This is important because
                    people get ginned up by each other if you have people working at a similar level
                    in government with a common task coming together for meetings. So we had a
                    meeting. We had a couple of meetings. It wasn't huge, and everybody wouldn't get
                    together every month because these people had high-level positions and a lot
                    going on. They didn't need a lot of these meetings; but we did a couple at the
                    White House, and then later on, when we moved to State, we did it there. But
                    Donna Shalala and Hillary Clinton would come, and of course that would be very
                    invigorating and exciting -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?especially Hillary Clinton, the First Lady, for these women appointees
                    from different parts of the government. We had people report on what they did:
                    “Jill, could you talk a little about your project at Agriculture and what you're
                    planning to do?”</p>
                <p>And another really, truly dynamic and fascinating person was Sally Shelton-Colby,
                    who was one of the top administrators at USAID. Sally was one of the proponents
                    of putting women at the center of development, and so was a leader in the U.S.
                    government's efforts to do that since the beginning of the Clinton
                    administration. And, she'd been to the Beijing Conference with us, and had
                    played a really significant role there, and was very, very engaged. So Sally was
                    a great model for others and she'd say: “As I look at development and at what
                    AID is trying to do - alleviating poverty and raising the standard of living for
                    people around the world - by investing in women, we find this to be an important
                    thing.”</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>But more than just those words, she had actually done a very comprehensive review
                    of how AID was conducting its programs: very concrete and businesslike, and
                    intended to get people thinking about, whether concerns of women were being
                    addressed. For example: in this water project, were women designing where the
                    wells should be in that village, since they're the ones who are actually going
                    to go out and get the water. So, really concrete things were being addressed as
                    the programs were being structured so that women were not just the beneficiaries
                    at the end, but also the designers of the programs and of the product of the
                    program. So Sally would come, and she'd be a great model for others, because she
                    had been doing this for a while, and she had the language of it, and she was
                    very elegant.</p>
                <p>She is still a very elegant woman, and very articulate, and had a lot of pizzazz,
                    and had been an ambassador during the Carter administration, had a lot of
                    authority and was very comfortable using it. The interesting thing from this
                    meeting is that she would then listen to Bonnie Campbell, who was the head of
                    this brand new Violence Against Women's Office at the Justice Department, talk
                    about the 1.6 billion dollars that was authorized through the Violence Against
                    Women Act. What Bonnie was doing was working with the criminal justice system in
                    the United States to get those grants out to the police level, to the
                    prosecutors, and hopefully some day to the judges, so they might even look at
                    this issue, and to community groups. Basically, it was getting the criminal
                    justice system to respond to this issue as mandated by the law. Sally heard that
                    and said, “Well, internationally, in the work I'm doing on development, I'd like
                    to have some more information to see how we can make use of some of these ideas
                    on a law, and its uses, and the legal structures. That would be helpful in some
                    of these countries to address the issue of violence against women.” So we had
                    this natural discussion.</p>
                <p>When you had highly motivated people coming together under the leadership of
                    Hillary Clinton, everybody got excited about coming together and being in the
                    room, and the agenda was planned to some degree, because we'd have Bonnie talk
                    about what she was doing, and Sally talk about the law. But then there were
                    these things that you couldn't predict, where Sally would say, “Well, I'd like
                    to think about what I could be doing with that violence,” or “Bonnie, would you
                    come and give me some advice,” and, “Could you help brief some of the people in
                    my area who are working in the issues of development and democracy building;”
                    and there were just many others.</p>
                <p>There was a great person over at the Department of Transportation, and I remember
                    Kathy Hendrix and I would be, “Oh, my God! What the heck is the Department of
                    Transportation? What is this?” And you know, true State Department snobs that we
                    were [laughter] -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>LOAR: And I remember we went over to the woman who was the chief of staff to
                    Secretary Pena, Ann Bormolini, she was from Denver. She was the chief of staff,
                    and she was just terrific. There was another woman there whose name I forget.
                    But when we walked away from there, we said, “We didn't realize that
                    transportation was a feminist issue, did we?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't know, huh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Who would think? They said, “Okay, these are some of the things we've been
                    thinking about, but we're going to move them to the front burner.” And it wasn't
                    as though we were hitting people over the head; it was really broadening their
                    thinking and giving them a context and a framework to work on some of these
                    issues, so that it wasn't like, “all I'm organized to do. What next?” One of
                    their key issues was, that if you look at who's using public transportation,
                    low-income women and older women, women that are kind of at the margins of
                    society use it disproportionately to men. Like, oh really! That's interesting!
                    So you have to look at how you're making public transportation available to
                    them. And it was just fascinating to dig at the things that they were going to
                    be doing. hey wanted to fill us in on that, and it was great.</p>
                <p>And then we would act as some sort of link. For example, someone would say, “And
                    what about helping women who are visiting prisoners and family members who are
                    in prison?” And I'd think, “Oh, I know there's someone at the Justice Department
                    working on that too.” So we were like this switching gear and a link for people
                    so they could come together.</p>
                <p>Now the NGO community assumed, “Oh, doesn't the government work that way?”
                    “HELLO! No!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: “It doesn't work that way. We would certainly like government to work that
                    way, but it doesn't.” It wasn't that we came up with every idea of what people
                    needed to do, but this task force gave them a way to coordinate; and yes, we
                    were cheerleaders, and pushing them up higher, and using whatever it would take
                    to get people active in getting it done. But people wanted to do this too! They
                    were excited about having something that many of them thought was important
                    validated as an important and significant government action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way, you were pushing or doing this at the
                        right time. I think we've gone through sort of the revolutionary aspect
                        which was kind of resented by a lot of guys because women were pushing too
                        hard and all. That was over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Correct me if I'm wrong, but this was the time when we
                        began to ask, “What are we going to do about it?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. And it's also that we were all very conscious, having been through
                    this UN conference and all the difficulties [laughter] that we encountered
                    there, how you talk about these issues, and how you frame the issues. So it
                    wasn't something that's counter to or taking away from something else, but
                    became fully integrated into everything else you were doing. It wasn't like the
                    chief of staff at the Department of Transportation was going to stop something
                    else that she was doing; but it was sort of building this into it so it's
                    enhanced.</p>
                <p>We also looked at this as not something that benefited women, but women and their
                    families. We used that language a lot, and it wasn't for manipulative purposes;
                    it was true. Okay, if you know an elderly woman has better access to public
                    transportation, well, that's great for her whole family then, isn't it? And if a
                    woman in the Justice Department who has been subjected to violence, now has
                    access to some services and is able to get the legal remedy she needs, isn't
                    that better for her family? Of course it is!</p>
                <p>So it was fun though. We were building and creating as we went, and doing this we
                    were sort of the “true believers” here in our little office at the White House.
                    There was so much energy and so much interest.</p>
                <p>One example is one representative from each agency would convene meetings. Bonnie
                    Campbell at Justice pulled together the Criminal Justice people, for the victims
                    - now there's a whole office on victims' services. In the Criminal Justice
                    Office there was a person who was doing a study and said, “We're looking at why
                    there are higher rates of female juvenile delinquency, why there's more juvenile
                    crime among females than there was in the past.” And then one of the mid-level
                    people from HHS was looking at this and saying, “Yes, and we're really worried
                    about the high teenage pregnancy rate.” And the Education Department person
                    said, “Yes, I'm more worried about the dropout rate.” So the three of them
                    started working together. You would think that this would already be happening,
                    but it wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>LOAR: Now was this revolutionary? No, it was fabulous! It was good government
                    policy. Well, how do we keep girls in school? Okay, that's Education's. How do
                    we keep them from getting involved in criminal activity? That was Justice's
                    concern. And then HHS, how do we keep them from getting pregnant and making
                    those unwise choices? So it was good common sense and great government policy.
                    And like I was a true leader in government before? But this whole exercise made
                    me just thrilled about what the possibilities were of what government could be
                    doing. And, I thought back to my Uncle Jim McCabe, who inspired me to think
                    about working for the Foreign Service in the first place and his perpetual flame
                    to FDR, and I thought that was how my uncle looked at government. That was how
                    my parents looked at government. It's something that really rescued people,
                    could save them, could lift them up, could help them achieve their American
                    dreams. And I was thinking this while looking at this work and the people who
                    were working all over the government. It became very interesting and very fun
                    for us to be able to think about how to elevate this issue to get more people
                    focused on it and to get them working together to develop new policies that
                    really made a difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Donna Shalala operated? I mean she was a
                        Washington or an American phenomenon. She was a short little woman with just
                        this tremendous drive, who, I think, even attacked a thief one time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Donna Shalala is a phenomenally gifted and talented person, who I think we
                    were very lucky to have as our Secretary of HHS for the two terms of the Clinton
                    administration, which was a giant, tough job. She's just charming, and feisty,
                    and smart, and was fabulous! She has terrific leadership, and she was so much
                    fun at the Beijing Conference.</p>
                <p>I don't remember if I told this story on tape. At the Beijing Conference, one of
                    the episodes happened when we went out to the NGO (Non-governmental
                    Organization) Forum, which the Chinese had moved outside of Beijing into this
                    open, rural area called Huairou, where there were no facilities. It was
                    literally just this flat open land. They figured out that NGOs were perhaps not
                    there for a craft fair, but to really promote democracy [laughter] and things
                    like that. They were a little bit troubled by that, so they moved them away from
                    where they thought the press would be, and where they might infect other people;
                    so they put them out in the countryside.</p>
                <p>So we had this terrible place to go to. Everyone traveled out to it as we were
                    determined to do as a U.S. delegation. It was one of the things I felt was
                    extremely important: that the U.S. delegation be out and about at this NGO
                    Forum. It was a pain in the neck, because it was probably an hour outside of
                    Beijing, and it was through these difficult roads.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Of course Donna Shalala, being just the grassroots organizer she was, who came
                    from nowhere and was a completely self-made person by the dint of her talent and
                    her determination, was determined to go out to this NGO Forum. The First Lady,
                    Hillary Clinton, was going to give a big speech at the NGO Forum, which was
                    another big point of contention, because people said, “Oh, you shouldn't! It's
                    too wild and crazy out there!” It was like, “HELLO! That's where the democracy
                    advocates and the NGO organizers are going to be. Some of them are going to be
                    in the UN meeting in town, but the real movers and shakers, those whom we want
                    to influence, and to know that America supports what they are doing, because we
                    are also for freedom and democracy, and all this, were going to be there.”</p>
                <p>So we had a caravan of members of Congress, including Connie Morella from
                    Maryland, who's just the most wonderful person. We had Jane Harman from
                    California, and Carolyn McCarthy, a congresswoman from New York; and we had
                    members of the press; Andrea Mitchell was on one of these vans. and I'm trying
                    to think who else was in the group going out to the NGO forum. Clare Shipman was
                    there, as well as a few other really prominent people who are now even more
                    prominent; and we had cabinet members. We [laughter] were working our way
                    through the roads, and of course, the caravan got split up. There were great
                    stories of how people broke through, and got to the forum.</p>
                <p>The meeting room where Hillary Clinton was going to give this big speech to the
                    NGOs, which was going to be a real highlight for those who didn't have access to
                    the UN meetings, and who were traipsing around in the mud because it had rained
                    for days out there. But what the Chinese did was to decide that they were going
                    to fill the room with their own people, meaning the Chinese male guards who were
                    out to protect people from democracy I guess. So, they had the whole room
                    filled, and they would just empty the room out row by row letting in people who
                    they determined were okay. But there was actually pushing and shoving at one
                    point; and Donna Shalala and Governor Tom [Thomas] Kean, former Republican
                    governor of my home state, New Jersey (who was a great human being, who speaks
                    with a New England accent, by the way [laughter]), he and Donna - now he's quite
                    a tall man and Donna is a?is not a tall person - and the two of them I remember
                    [laughter]. I'll never forget this picture! We also had Win [Winston] Lord who
                    was the Assistant Secretary for Asia, who was very game, and had come on the
                    plane with the First Lady. I remember them sort of being pushed around by the
                    guards (and literally, you could see that the guards liked the pictures, because
                    the press was fascinated by this - see the guards sort of pushing them), and you
                    could see these tough guys with crew cuts and slippers. I remember Donna saying,
                    “You know, those of us who've been through the women's movement have seen
                    tougher times than this!”</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>LOAR: And I think they got into the meeting room to hear Hillary Clinton's
                    speech. I don't know. But the Chinese were just so heavy-handed, and so
                    ridiculous. Donna was terrific at sound bytes and communicating clearly, in
                    addition to just being someone who was just determined it was all going to get
                    done.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I remember at one of these interagency council meetings, we had one time
                    over at HHS in one of her fancy, schmancy board rooms, or we may have had it at
                    the White House. I can't remember the location. But Donna said, “You know,
                    you're all from these other agencies, and all those other cabinet members are my
                    friends. So if there are things that you'd like me to pass a word along to them
                    on, they'd be happy to hear from me.” [Laughter] I'm sure they wouldn't. But
                    suddenly these agencies thought, “Oh, yeah! Donna will help us out. She'll drop
                    a word there for us.” And, of course, people would deeply resent Donna Shalala
                    telling them what to do with their agency [laughter]. But her idea was, “If we
                    can do it in my agency, they can do it in other places, too.”</p>
                <p>And she just empowered people with her sense of optimism, determination, and bold
                    thinking. “We are here in government to do good for the American people, and
                    this is one of the things we're going to do, and we're going to do it right, and
                    we're going to make it effective, and by gosh we're all going to do it!” She was
                    very good. There were a number of things like that, where she would speak very
                    plainly, very directly, and very clearly. She knew how to take ideas, and to
                    boil them down to two or three points whose meaning people could understand. She
                    was very energetic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming from this from the foreign relations viewpoint,
                        were you in contact with other countries? Or were they saying, “What are you
                        doing?” and you'd say, “We're doing this,” and you would keep them informed;
                        and then did you see any results of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, this first year, being outside of the State Department and being
                    detailed over to the White House, was actually a time I had less international
                    contact than I had in previous times in the State Department. But the word
                    started spreading.</p>
                <p>Anytime there was a minister for women or anyone who had served on the Beijing
                    delegation who came through Washington, they usually found their way over to our
                    office. It was sort of like a high-five. “Yes, wasn't that great!” Other
                    countries were very interested to know and would ask, “What is the U.S. doing?
                    So you set up a government task force, and you mean you have your central White
                    House supporting this? And you have a cabinet member of some means and
                    significance as your chair? And you have your First Lady as your honorary chair?
                    And you have a budget too?”</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>And our budget was really just to sort of?we didn't need much. We weren't doing
                    much, other than writing reports on what people were doing. We'd been asked to
                    conduct speaking tours around the country, and we could only respond to a
                    portion of those, but we did try to get everybody out talking about what they
                    were doing. So it was really just a matter of organizing and moving people
                    together.</p>
                <p>But I remember the Japanese government decided they were going to do a follow-up.
                    They sent in these fellows who were with a private foundation in Japan - I guess
                    they were like a think tank - to interview us at length. And I thought, “Isn't
                    this cool. They're interested in what we're doing.” We were interested, and
                    asked them what they intended to do, and they said, “We haven't decided yet what
                    we're going to do. So we wanted to hear what works, and what are good
                    mechanisms, and things like that.”</p>
                <p>And we would regularly meet with some of the women's ministers and delegates from
                    other countries, and hear what they were doing.</p>
                <p>At this time we weren't doing much on email, unfortunately. We didn't have much
                    means to communicate internationally. But we did see the cables that came in
                    regularly from our embassies in other countries. But for that first six month to
                    a year period, it was much more focused on pulling our government agencies
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what, '96 to??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: September of 1995 [Beijing Conference]. So October of 1995 we opened the
                    doors of the President's Interagency Council on Women.</p>
                <p>The other component of that was there was a consensus among the UN people on
                    something. Everyone agreed on what they would do. After about a year after the
                    conference, all countries would report to their citizens on what they had done
                    to follow through on the commitments they had made at the conference. (And I do
                    think, again, this is the Australians putting this on the table, which was
                    wonderful.) They also had to hear from citizens about what they thought their
                    government should do. Can you imagine this getting into a UN document? It really
                    was democracy gone wild! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>LOAR: But bringing NGOs into the process of government. We took that very
                    seriously, of course, as we said we were going to do this. So what were we going
                    to do? And a couple people said, “Well, we'll have a little conference here in
                    Washington, and blah, blah, blah, and people can come in.” Then all the sharks
                    started coming in with their proposals: “My firm will do this for this amount of
                    money, yah, blah, blah, blah.”</p>
                <p>Then we had a wonderful person, Joan Winship, who was from Iowa, and who was with
                    the Stanley Foundation. The Stanley Foundation is a private foundation whose
                    goal is to support and encourage Americans to be involved in international
                    issues. She had been very involved in one of the NGOs we had worked closely with
                    in preparing for Beijing. And Joan said, “When we do conferences across the
                    country, we would never do it in one city. Certainly you don't want to do it in
                    Washington! That's like not the center of the United States! Why don't you do it
                    on broadcast via satellite, and you can downlink it to community colleges all
                    across the country?” And we said, “Well, how do we do that?” She said, “Well,
                    here's the organization, community colleges, and they love doing these kinds of
                    things, and just take it from there.” So the idea that Joan Winship presented to
                    Kathy Hendrix and me - was a way to report back to the American people in an
                    open way which allowed people to really think about and to hear what you're
                    doing, and to understand what you're doing, and also to have some input. We
                    actually made that one of the key projects we wanted to do: to find a way to do
                    this end-of-year summary, in addition to the reports we were getting out.</p>
                <p>But even before the Beijing Conference, we had started doing public briefings
                    because people were intensely interested in all kinds of issues. We did these
                    open public briefings at the Office of Personnel Management, which you could get
                    in without being precleared. (I guess you just showed an ID, maybe a driver's
                    license. Can you imagine getting into a government office?) We were trying to
                    set up this principle that we were open and we were government. At that time, we
                    were getting ready for the Beijing Conference at the State Department conference
                    secretariat. I was really determined that we should be open to people whether
                    they were coming in to criticize us, or to tell us what should be done as we
                    were supposed to be representing Americans at this conference. We didn't really
                    have the Internet or a web site at that time, so these open public briefings
                    were the best we could do; and we did those every month.</p>
                <p>I wanted to set out the principle that Tim Wirth pioneered when he was
                    Undersecretary. This was that you wanted to build constituencies with the work
                    that you were doing, and you also want people to understand what you're doing so
                    your work was transparent. If they have some input, they can criticize or they
                    can tell you you're right or wrong. But, you've done it in a transparent way so
                    people know where you're going. And so we held these briefings every month and
                    when we came back from Beijing, we continued holding those; so it was this very
                    open way of continuing to talk to this whole NGO community.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>There were some highly critical people who thought that we were destroying
                    American families because of our policies on family planning, and others who
                    thought that we were not doing enough on that same issue. There were other
                    people who thought that we needed to do more pushing on some of the legal
                    remedies for women. But we were always open, and we would feature different
                    speakers, “Okay, here's somebody from HHS who is going to talk about what
                    they're doing; here's someone from the Treasury Department; here's?;” we would
                    just feature different speakers, but keep it as an open process.</p>
                <p>When we got close to a year after this conference, we began to think: “How do we
                    do this reporting back to Americans?” We decided to use Joan Winship's broadcast
                    idea. The Department of Agriculture offered us their studio, and we had the
                    leaders of the delegation to Beijing - Hillary Clinton, Madeleine Albright, and
                    Donna Shalala, as well as some of the NGOs - speak from Washington. We had a
                    bunch of organizers and volunteers who had been working to keep people engaged
                    at the state level. We ended up having 800 downlink sites, with something like
                    60,000 or 80,000 people gathered. A number of people put together whole-day
                    events around this downlink broadcast.</p>
                <p>We had reports in from different people. We had someone from the bayou region of
                    Louisiana, who had been a nun. A community of nuns had come back from Beijing
                    and were looking at how to develop more low-income housing for the
                    disadvantaged; and I thought that was a great step, not that nuns need
                    inspiration to do this kind of social justice work, but linking it to this UN
                    conference and feeling that they were part of that was. We had a college girl
                    from Iowa who had developed new safety programs for girls on her campus; she did
                    a video for us and reported that in. We had some people call in. We had Mia Hamm
                    and Julie Foudy, two of the big soccer stars, talk about the kind of things they
                    were doing for women's sports; it was very cool.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And we had Judy Woodruff, the CNN reporter and anchor, agree to moderate
                    this thing. It became a really significant program, and it was a great way to
                    report out to people and to have people report in to us. It was all staged, but
                    it was very representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that you were able to reach across the
                        aisle to get a significant Republican commitment to this? How did you find
                        Republicans views on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, some Republican members of Congress came with us to the Beijing
                    Conference, Connie Morella, for example. Others who didn't support the
                    reproductive, health, and family planning policies came and let us know they
                    didn't support that. This wasn't really a partisan agenda. Reproductive health
                    is always going to have strong views on both sides, but there was nothing else
                    on the agenda that we were working on that was partisan, or would be Democratic,
                    or Republican. So I wouldn't say that we were talking to Democrats or working
                    with Democrats. We were working with people who cared about these issues and
                    wanted them to move forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: At that time, we didn't come in for much criticism. We were under the
                    radar. We didn't have any of the extremists on the Hill coming after us, because
                    what we were really doing was developing well coordinated government policy with
                    a greater focus on women, and girls, and their families. We didn't really come
                    under attack, which was a great victorto be able to get a lot done and not have
                    anybody slug you down while you were doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it is. No, this is the whole thing, you know,
                        particularly since so many things have turned into the-right-versus-the-left
                        on the abortion issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, that is a central issue that divides people. It was behind a lot
                    of the concerns about what the U.S. was going to do at the Beijing Conference.
                    For most of the people in the world who were coming to that conference, that was
                    only one issue; there were many, many other things they wanted. The central
                    issue that came out, which was the result of the greater emphasis on looking at
                    this issue in ways that had never been done before, was the issue of violence
                    against women and a greater recognition that governments had a role to play in
                    passing laws to make this illegal, and in creating an environment where this was
                    not considered to be a cultural thing, or an okay thing. So the issue of
                    violence against women became sort of the issue that came out of the
                    conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this isn't partisan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think it'd be hard for any American politician to stand up and say,
                    “I'm for that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>LOAR: There were some who were more supportive than others in implementing the
                    Violence Against Women Act. There actually are some groups who say that that law
                    turns women into victims, and that the statistics on violence are exaggerated
                    and weaken women; but they're really truly on the fringe, and if they haven't
                    figured that out yet, let me be the first to tell them! They really are truly on
                    the fringe, because if you look at the issue of violence against women, it took
                    20 years for it to get from the grassroots level, where people started coming
                    together and saying, “We need to do something about this,” to our government
                    passing a law that became the law of the land and empowered an office at the
                    Justice Department to bring it into the federal government level with money,
                    which is a great accomplishment. There are lots of laws that have no money for
                    implementation - but with money, which means grants could be given at the police
                    level, on the community level, this could begin to be addressed; and that is, I
                    think, tremendous progress that's been made there.</p>
                <p>And as my friend Bonnie Campbell, who is really the pioneer and the expert on
                    these issues, said when she was running for attorney general in the state of
                    Iowa, she learned a lot about this issue by going door-to-door and finding out
                    that this was something that people felt was not being addressed but was
                    something that was destroying families. It wasn't some personal, private little
                    thing; it was in the way of people living their lives. What she said was that at
                    the police level they made tremendous progress, and at the prosecutor's level
                    they're making progress, but, at the judge's level it was harder to break
                    through. But there wasn't a disagreement that this was an important issue that
                    needed to be addressed. It was getting people to talk about it and to figure out
                    what they could do to make a difference that I think was very important.</p>
                <p>It's also how we framed this conference that we did one year after the Beijing
                    Conference. This was in September of 1996. We had materials, our logos, which is
                    the American flag with the profile of mother and daughter against the flag, and
                    Americas' commitment. People were thrilled to be linked to us at the White House
                    on a report back and on a discussion about what more we could be doing in our
                    community.</p>
                <p>Kansas City had its own action plan, and they reported back on what they had done
                    a year later. They had set up new mentoring systems for at-risk girls to keep
                    them in schools. They had set up new ways for successful businesswomen to mentor
                    women moving into business, particularly those at risk. This was great community
                    action, and it was a way of encouraging that and linking that to a larger
                    national purpose; people were very energized by this. This was never criticized
                    when people met in church basements, or in VA [Veterans' Administration]
                    hospitals, or in schools. It wasn't like some radical feminist gathering. If you
                    looked at it, it'd be the people we would run into at community group meetings
                    all across the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm thinking of another trend, which I really
                        haven't monitored very much, but I've just read about. It came out of the
                        male black rap culture in which an awful lot of violence against women was
                        glorified in much of the popular songs that came out in the 90s. This must
                        have been very disturbing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The rap stuff?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: As a mother of teenagers, it's really disturbing! Yes, there are groups who
                    have focused on that. There are others who are very clear in speaking out
                    against it, including leaders in the black community. And apparently one of the,
                    I can't remember his name, I wish I did, first pioneers of rap, first people in
                    the music industry to really develop rap and to use it as a means of expression,
                    and who was just recently killed, was clear that violence against women, the
                    street thugs, and the gangster stuff wasn't part of rap music originally. It was
                    sort of introduced into that, and sort of brought it down. But yes, that's
                    [sigh] very disturbing; and there are many who've spoken out about that,
                    including some of the performers who tried to offer alternatives to that. But,
                    it always bothers me when my teenagers would listen only to just what's on the
                    radio; and it bothers me to see this as being glorified; and it's extremely
                    prevalent right now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of violence against women, what parts of the
                        community in the U.S. were being addressed in this focus on violence against
                        women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think the Violence Against Women Act was really set up to address
                    this within all communities. I know there was an advisory committee, who worked
                    with Bonnie Campbell; and they represented immigrant communities, all income
                    brackets, people, and businessmen who were concerned about the issue because
                    they thought it affected whether or not people could come to work and carry out
                    their jobs. It was a business collage in community groups.</p>
                <p>As I said, it was something that the Justice Department was really taking the
                    lead in. There was intense interest in the mechanism and in how this could be
                    done in different communities. Other countries and their governments then became
                    very interested. Sometimes it was the government; sometimes it was the female
                    legislators; sometimes it was First Ladies of other countries, who were very
                    interested in, “What is your government doing on violence, and what is this law?
                    How is that being carried out? How do you work within the communities?”</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>Sometimes First Ladies from other countries would come in and meet with Hillary
                    Clinton, and she would ask them to go over to see Bonnie Campbell. They would
                    say, “I really want to know what you're doing on violence against women.” And
                    she'd say, “Well, we have an appointee here at the Justice Department who's
                    leading the work on this, and we have a law, and she implements that law.” So
                    Bonnie Campbell would meet with First Ladies from other countries at the request
                    of Hillary Clinton, because they were interested in knowing what could be done.
                    And it was interesting that Bonnie was asked. We encouraged them to talk to
                    Bonnie, and then Bonnie was asked to go out and speak in other countries; and of
                    course, her responsibility was really domestic, but occasionally, if she had the
                    opportunity, she would go and do some work internationally. She did some work in
                    Russia, for example. But more than anything, it was when people were coming to
                    Washington that she would give them some guidance and ideas on what was working
                    here in the United States, or what was in process, and what the obstacles were.
                    But it was this truly significant breakthrough.</p>
                <p>During the conference, Bonnie would walk around the NGO Forum in Huairou, and
                    walk around in the UN meeting rooms; she was really like a rock star, because no
                    other country had a high level appointee who was a former attorney general of a
                    state (a very significant position), whose job it was to run this Violence
                    Against Women Office and to implement this law. So there was just intense
                    interest in that, and that has never gone away.</p>
                <p>Jumping ahead a little bit, when I did move back to the State Department, one of
                    the things we would do is sort of track progress since the Beijing Conference,
                    and encourage the embassies to report this to us. But what I would find when
                    international visitors would come in to see me, especially woman legislators
                    from Latin America; was that they were working together as a group and they were
                    just borrowing laws from each other and looking at other good modelthe United
                    States and otherand passing laws in country after country to criminalize rape,
                    to criminalize violence against women; and to set up police units. Brazil had
                    great models, and Ecuador had perfect models; they were being very practical
                    about putting laws on the books. So that was one of the very concrete things
                    that came out of that conference, within like a year of the conference; you
                    could just kind of look down the hemisphere and see what a difference that
                    conference had made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, this council lasted for about a year or
                        so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Actually it ended. The Interagency Council on Women continued as a
                    government mechanism till the end of the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It became an interagency task force.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when the Bush II administration came
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, there were two things: there was the interagency council, which was
                    this government task force; and then there was, within the State Department, the
                    senior coordinator for international women's issues, which is this SES position
                    under the Undersecretary for Global Affairs, that really looks at women's human
                    rights within foreign policy.</p>
                <p>And the interagency council, you know, the big strength there, just jumping
                    ahead, was being able to have access to these people all over government, not
                    just for what they were doing in our own agency, but also how they could be
                    working on some of the international issues we were looking at. And some of the
                    concrete things that came out of that were the work we did on trafficking, and
                    getting a law passed on it, and getting the really broad interagency cooperation
                    as we were working on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about what used to be called white slavery,
                        aren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, selling human beings into conditions of slavery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Human trafficking, and trafficking women and girls, but really broadly
                    trafficking, and the other issue that we worked on was the democracy building
                    promotional program called Vital Voices.</p>
                <p>But with the new law on trafficking, and the Violence Against Women Act [of
                    2000], and the protection for trafficking victims act [Trafficking Victims
                    Protection Act of 2000], which we got passed in the end of 2000, what we wanted
                    was a permanent structure to duplicate the interagency structure we had, and we
                    wrote that that would be at the State Department into the law. It was mandated
                    that the State Department would house an office on trafficking, but that that
                    would be interagency with interagency responsibility.</p>
                <p>In just looking at whether the interagency council would continue, I would say
                    that there were some who thought it was a good idea, and some who thought it
                    wasn't a good idea. I thought it had served its purpose because we had terrific
                    opportunities, terrific leadership - people committed to the Beijing Conference
                    and the Beijing agenda. I wasn't sure we would have that same level of
                    commitment and interest from the new administration coming in; and I think it's
                    just fine that that council doesn't exist now. [Laughter]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find yourself caught up in some sort of
                        foreign policy issues? For example, everything you're talking about would
                        run counter to trying to be nice to Saudi Arabia. Now, at last, people are
                        beginning to focus on Saudi Arabia, and on what they're doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, getting back to the foreign policy piece of it, a year after we did
                    this “year-after conference” as our wrap up, a position at the State Department,
                    called the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues, opened up.
                    Dorothy Thomas, who was one of the women in the human rights community, who as a
                    founder and director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch had
                    pioneered the idea and issue of women's human rights and of identifying violence
                    against women as a human rights violation, had gotten it written into the State
                    Department authorization bill - maybe it was another bill, I'm not sure I have
                    the right name [Foreign Relations Authorization Act Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995?]
                    - that a position should be created within the Office of the Undersecretary for
                    Global Affairs to focus on the human rights of women as a way of integrating
                    that into foreign policy; and that position had been open for a few months when
                    the administrations changed.</p>
                <p>So, after this one-year-after teleconference that we did, I looked at that
                    position. I was asked to consider taking that as a way to carry on the foreign
                    policy work; and I was ready to do that. I loved the State Department. It was
                    fun being at the White House, but I also really loved foreign policy work, and I
                    missed my daily dose of cables from all over the world. I was very eager to take
                    the issues that we had been working on before the conference and at the
                    conference related to women's advancement and to look at really integrating
                    these into foreign policy.</p>
                <p>So I resigned from the Foreign Service and took this on as a presidential
                    appointment. It was a Senior Executive Service position. It was a great,
                    wonderful leap. I went back to State and took this on. Maybe we can sort of end
                    there for now. That's a whole other focus of how we did this with the foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick this up in 1997?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Six [1996].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was October of 1996 I came over, literally moving back into the State
                    Department a couple of days after the Taliban had moved into Kabul in
                    Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Great. Well, we'll pick it up then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>LOAR: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as an addendum, would you mention the publication
                        that came as a -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Oh, as a wrap up at the end of the Clinton administration, we did a
                    report that Lidia Soto-Harmon honchoed. She was one of the deputies on the
                    interagency council. It was called, America's Commitment: Women 2000, and it was
                    a five-year review of all the federal programs that we had put in place to
                    benefit women and their families and of the many initiatives that came out of
                    the Beijing Conference. This is actually over 300 pages [378 pages]. It was a
                    huge compilation, and is something that I wish I had hundreds of, because people
                    are still coming to visit me from other countries and are still looking for
                    ideas on how their federal governments could be doing things to benefit women.
                    This report is a very good model for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Okay. Well, we'll pick this up the next time when
                        you went back to the State Department in '96.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Today is 27 February 2003. Theresa, October of
                        '96, what was the job? You left the Foreign Service and went into what
                        political??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Okay. The position was Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues,
                    and it was a position created by Congress in one of the State Department
                    appropriation bills, I believe. The position was created in 1995. It was the
                    handiwork of a very clever women's human rights leader named Dorothy Thomas, who
                    went to Senator [Patrick] Leahy's office, and?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Leahy of Vermont.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>LOAR: Senator Leahy of Vermont, and Senator [Olympia] Snowe, who was a Republican
                    senator from Maine, who I think actually sponsored or put it into its final
                    language. But anyway, Senator Leahy, a great human rights person, and Tim Rieser
                    on his staff were really pushing for a senior position to be created at the
                    State Department to focus on women's human rights. This position was housed in
                    (G), the Undersecretary for Global Affairs. Apparently, at the time that it was
                    being created, there was a move to put it in the Human Rights Bureau. But Tim
                    Wirth, who was the Undersecretary at that time, wanted it at a higher level, and
                    he had visions for what this position could be. He was able to get this Senior
                    Coordinator for International Women's Issues housed in (G). The first person to
                    hold that position was a woman named Gracia Hillman, who came from the League of
                    Women Voters. She held that position as we were preparing for Beijing. She left
                    the administration and left that position in April of 1996.</p>
                <p>At that point, we were back from the Beijing Conference. We had created the
                    Interagency Council on Women, this government task force to follow up on
                    Beijing. I was on detail from State over to the White House, sitting in the New
                    Executive Office Building, and having a lot of fun, sort of taking this fabulous
                    Beijing document, the Platform for Action, and working with all the different
                    federal agencies and their representatives who were assigned to this task force,
                    the President's Interagency Council on Women, to look at how that - the
                    principles, and the ideas, and the strategies that came out of that terrific UN
                    Conference on Women - could be integrated into the work they were doing.</p>
                <p>So we had done an awful lot towards getting that integration done. We had a
                    strong, vibrant interagency council going with Hillary Clinton as the honorary
                    chair, and that made all the difference in the world, because it showed there
                    was high-level political support for this work. Donna Shalala, our Secretary of
                    Health and Human Services, was the chair, and she was, as you know, known for
                    her very open, direct, and energetic support for women's programs in HHS. So, to
                    have her as chair of this government-wide task force made all the sense in the
                    world. A year after the Beijing Conference we did a satellite conference,
                    reporting back to Americans, and having Americans from all around the States
                    report in to us what they had done, and that was really great fun and a great
                    success.</p>
                <p>And then this position was open at State. And of course, my heart was with the
                    State Department and foreign policy. Seeing what difference it made when we had
                    an understanding of these issues and how they could affect the lives of women,
                    and going to this big international conference and seeing the need for these
                    issues to be put on governments' agendas, and moving them out of the NGOs or
                    other elements of society, and onto the government agenda, was very interesting
                    to me. Something I thought could make a real difference was to try and build
                    this, and to deepen this, and to put this into foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>I was selected for this, and it was a wonderful, great leap. I moved back to
                    State, as I mentioned, in October 1996. I moved into an office where there was
                    no secretarial support, and no staff because Gracia Hillman's very nice
                    secretary, who had been on detail, went back to her previous assignment. So I
                    walked into my home building, the State Department, ready to go, and ready to
                    get everybody on board with these important issues affecting women's rights
                    progress around the world, and I didn't have a fax machine! I did have a chair
                    and a desk! I think it's the story of my life - I never could walk into an
                    office with an existing couch and matching chairs; I always had to scrounge. But
                    I did have three or four interns from the White House who had a White House
                    Security clearance, and State allowed me to bring them over with me, so they
                    became my instant staff. They were really sharp, bright, energetic young
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about what an intern was at that
                        particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. When we were over at the White House and I was Director of the
                    President's Interagency Council on Women, we had interns that would come in and
                    just take on all kinds of projects. I was able to bring, as I mentioned, some of
                    them over with us.</p>
                <p>One of the interns was Alyse Nelson, who had just graduated from Emerson College,
                    and who is now working with me as a professional staff member here at Vital
                    Voices and manages our global network around the world. And we had a really
                    terrifically smart, young woman, who looked like Daryl Hannah. It was always
                    great to send her down to [laughter] talk to the guys in different offices
                    around the State Department about these issues - and I'm just blanking on her
                    name, I'll remember her name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we can fill it in later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She had done some human rights work as an intern. She had just graduated
                    from one of the universities here in town. Her job was to monitor the cables
                    that came into the State Department on follow-up to the Beijing Conference,
                    because one of the first things I thought I needed to do was to show that the
                    Beijing Conference, this UN Conference on Women in 1995, had made a difference,
                    and that it wasn't just the U.S. actively pushing this agenda forward, but that
                    other people in other parts of the world were doing that too. I was hoping that
                    this was the case.</p>
                <p>So this intern's job was to monitor the cables and to give me a short briefing of
                    cables that came in from our overseas posts, and there were about four or five a
                    day. I was delirious with joy that there were four or five. But this young woman
                    thought that this was ridiculous because they're such central issues, why
                    weren't there more cables coming in?</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>So, what she started was a monthly newsletter where we would track progress made
                    around the world since Beijing. When we got a cable in from some great Foreign
                    Service officer for example reporting from Brazil on the things I mentioned
                    before or from Colombia that they had made penalties stiffer for domestic
                    violence, this great intern would put it in the newsletter. It was particularly
                    noteworthy that we got lots of these cables from Latin America where we saw
                    women legislators working together to strengthen their laws, to criminalize
                    rape, to criminalize domestic violence, and to set up a criminal justice systems
                    to respond to violence against women.</p>
                <p>So our intern started doing this and every month we would have this thing that we
                    would issue to NGOs. This position was indirectly created by NGOs, and I wanted
                    to be sure that those in the human rights community knew how activist we were
                    being. They became our great friends and allies as we were doing this work,
                    because the truth is that the idea of women's human rights was a concept that
                    was only a few years old. There were two people who really made the difference
                    in developing the language for this work. One was Dorothy Thomas, who I
                    mentioned, was the creator of the Women's Human Rights Project at Human Rights
                    Watch, which is one of the great, very well respected human rights
                    organizations, and the other is a woman named Charlotte Bunch at Rutgers'
                    Douglass College, who was Executive Director of the Center for Women's Global
                    Leadership. I still work with Charlotte very closely.</p>
                <p>We had a constituency. We wanted people from outside the State Department. In my
                    preparations for Beijing and my working at the Beijing conference I also knew
                    how important it was to bring all NGOs from all sides of the political spectrum
                    into the process of developing these policies. So we had open doors; we had open
                    public briefings; and we continued those processes because I did believe that
                    that was very important. So we started doing this newsletter. Then, after a
                    period of time, we just looked at how further to engage the Assistant
                    Secretaries and others in the State Department on this fabulous agenda that we
                    were all sure they were going to agree with us on. And, literally within days of
                    coming into the building, the Taliban moved into Kabul. There was a -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain who the Taliban were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The Taliban were a ragtag, uneducated, highly armed group, many of whom had
                    grown up in refugee camps in Pakistan, and were very poorly educated in the
                    Islamic tradition. I know this from many of my Muslim friends here in the United
                    States who said that it was really not a sophisticated education of Islam that
                    they received because they had such strange non-Koranic-based versions of what
                    Islam was. But they had come into Afghanistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>There was tremendous struggle in Afghanistan for who was in control. There were
                    all kinds of warlords, including the Massoud who were struggling for control of
                    Afghanistan at the time. The Taliban moved in from the refugee camps in
                    Pakistan, with tremendous financial support (we found it was backing from
                    Pakistan), to the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, and declared that they were in
                    charge of the country.</p>
                <p>There was an initial statement made by a deputy spokesman for Secretary of State
                    Warren Christopher. I don't know the exact wording of it, but it gave the
                    impression, informally I was told, that: “Well, at least we'll have some
                    stability now.” And of course, the reaction of many people who knew what the
                    Taliban were and what they were trying to do was: “Well, it's going to be a
                    stable reign of terror,” because the first thing that they did was to issue
                    decrees saying that women Could not work outside the home, that girls could no
                    longer be in school, and that women could no longer move outside of the home,
                    not even to work to support their families. This was an issue as millions of
                    Afghan women were widows as a result of the Afghan-Russian war, and were the
                    sole support of their families. So it wasn't like they were reacting to women in
                    high heels, you know, in the corner office building their careers. These were
                    widows working in basic food-production jobs, many of which were created by the
                    United Nations: baking breads in the most primitive ovens possible, and being
                    part of the food distribution channel. So the Taliban came in and right in front
                    of CNN and in front of the whole world issued these decrees saying, “We're here,
                    we're an Islamic movement.” As I said, many Muslim groups in the United States
                    had terrible personal reactions to (I don't know how public they were about it)
                    the Taliban taking control of the country, and to their considering themselves
                    in charge.</p>
                <p>So I moved in to State, and the Deputy spokesman issued this statement that was
                    just, not like, “Whoa, hold the phone here! Look what you're doing when you come
                    into their country. The United States is very concerned about this!” but it
                    wasn't warm and fuzzy towards them; it was sort of neutral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And that, of course, came from the South Asia Bureau, and from a fellow who
                    was in charge of Afghan issues. So when I came in, right away I knew we needed
                    to respond to this in a very strong and direct way.</p>
                <p>We had just come back a year before from this terrific UN Fourth World Conference
                    on Women. Hillary Clinton had made this extraordinary speech that “women's
                    rights are human rights.” There was a real big push and interest on the part of
                    the women's human rights community, because the human rights community itself
                    was still not embracing it.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>The mainstream human rights groups were still not embracing the idea of violence
                    against women and other violations against women as real true human rights
                    issues. They were skeptical about that and not sure that they would consider
                    rape, and female genital mutilation, and other issues such as dowry burning, as
                    human rights issues. They weren't quite on board with that yet.</p>
                <p>But, there were women within the human rights community who were working to push
                    these women's issues. And then there were all these other groups who got really
                    energized by this Beijing Conference: teachers' associations, women accountants,
                    religious groups, the religious order of nuns, and the Leadership Conference of
                    Women Religious. I had been working with them, you know, and it brought me back
                    to my Catholic high school days. Only, these nuns weren't in habits, and I was
                    agreeing with them [laughter]! We were all pushing for the same social justice
                    issues.</p>
                <p>It was such a shocking thing when the Taliban came in; and for those of us who
                    were living in this world, just having come back from the Beijing Conference the
                    year before, it was a particularly shocking thing! So I thought that we needed
                    to get statements out immediately from Secretary Christopher, and from his
                    spokesman, who at that time was Nick [Nicholas] Burns - and is now currently our
                    ambassador to NATO, and has done extremely well, and is a very good guy. I knew
                    we needed to get strong statements out from his office. Well, I had no
                    experience working with the press office at the Secretariat, but I went to see
                    him to say, you know, “Nick, I'm really concerned about this. There's this kind
                    of statement of, 'Let's just act like it didn't happen.' It wasn't you. It was
                    the deputy. But now you're back in the office today, and I'd really like to say
                    that these violations of women's human rights are appalling to the United
                    States. It's against what we stand for as a country; excluding girls from school
                    and women from the ability to earn money to support their families.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think women were even excluded from hospitals, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Well, the catch 22 there was, if you couldn't have women as doctors
                    and women couldn't be treated by male doctors, women were basically denied
                    health care for the entire reign of the Taliban.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's not like they had tremendous health care before, but they had basic
                    health care needs met, especially in the cities.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>So Nick Burns said, “Well, just give me your guidance, and I'll work with you on
                    it.” So you know, me, a former Foreign Service officer, I said, “Well, I know
                    I'm supposed to clear it through the bureau and want to be able to work for the
                    bureau.” He said, “Well, you're not going to get this cleared through the
                    bureau!” And what he was referring to was this Foreign Service officer Lee
                    Coldren, who had very strong views. He was a fellow who had spent a lot of time
                    in the field, and had real strong views about Afghanistan, and considered this
                    annoying focus on women to be distracting. This is something I heard repeatedly,
                    “But like flavor of the month, we're going to worry about women now? Come on!
                    These Taliban have guns, they have this, they have this that. They're in there,
                    and they're going to stop some of the bad things going on!” And it's not that he
                    was pro-Taliban, but it was like, “Why are we worrying about women?” And it
                    wasn't that I didn't appreciate the point of view or understand the point of
                    view. I did! I was a Foreign Service officer, and I understood you look at a
                    country in totality. But I also knew that this was just unprecedented!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's not that there weren't other countries where women's human rights were
                    being violated; there were many other countries. But nobody was stupid enough,
                    as the Taliban were, to go in front of CNN and saying, “Girls can't go to
                    school, women cannot work outside the home and there'll be no movement of women
                    on the streets unless accompanied by a male relative.” Well that means that if
                    your husband's dead, and you don't have any brothers, and you don't have any
                    sons, you're basically housebound. And, that means if women can't work, they
                    can't be doctors to provide health care. So they were stupid enough to do this
                    right in front of the world, and we as a government had to respond.</p>
                <p>Nick Burns said, “I think what you did in Beijing was just terrific,” and I was
                    like, “Wow! You know what we did? You mean someone in this building paid
                    attention to this?” And he was just, “Look, I served in Muslim countries, and I
                    have three daughters, and I'm going to support you on this!” It was just
                    terrific.</p>
                <p>And that's the great thing about the State Department. Here is the structure, the
                    fellow in charge of Afghanistan and of the South Asia Bureau - a relatively new
                    bureau, the South Asia Bureau - who was dead against any of this focus on women
                    and anyone talking about our concern about women. He said, “But it's just not
                    that significant, and we shouldn't do it.” And I would not have been able to
                    break through if Nick Burns hadn't said, “Just give me your guidance, and I'll
                    use your guidance.” And not only did he use my guidance that I gave him every
                    day, which was, “This is of great concern to the United States. These egregious
                    human rights violations cannot be tolerated. This is not going to move the
                    country forward when half of its people are left behind,” just very strong
                    language. I would give him guidance whenever I thought it was appropriate.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>Even when I didn't give him guidance, he would bring it up in the press
                    briefings. If somebody asked something about another country in the region, he'd
                    say, “And let me go back to Afghanistan, and why I'm so, we are all, or
                    Secretary Christopher's so concerned about the treatment of women in
                    Afghanistan.” He was just terrific [laughter], and I needed exactly that
                    counterweight to the very aggressive, hostile, you know, bordering-on-bullying
                    tactics coming from the South Asia Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your contact with the South Asia Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I went down, as the good, you know, organization person that I am, or
                    a good company woman, to the bureau to say, “Nick's asked me for guidance,”
                    because it's true, he did ask me for it once [laughter] -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We talked it over, “and I just wanted to show you what I'm going to give
                    him, and I know you might not agree with the emphasis on women, but I think it's
                    important you understand the view in talking about it.”</p>
                <p>And there was yelling, and there was slamming of doors, and there were
                    disparaging remarks such as: “Who the heck are you?” “Have you ever been in the
                    country? Have you ever been in the Marines? And what are you talking about?”</p>
                <p>And it was just like, “No, I don't; but I do know what I've been appointed to do,
                    and I'm going to use my diplomatic background, and I'm getting my Foreign
                    Service colleagues, and I am going to send this to Nick,” and I was sure this
                    guy is going to come around.</p>
                <p>Well, he didn't. The time that we were speaking very publicly about this, I
                    wanted everybody to know too, because I don't think the press conferences
                    prepared, on C-Span at that time, this Secretary of State's press person. So
                    nobody really knew Nick was saying this. I knew it, and it felt good. But I
                    needed to let the NGO community and all those people outside of Capital Hill,
                    who were totally freaking out, knowing that the Taliban was making these
                    statements, that we were responding correctly. Because, already people were
                    ginning up, “Wow! They say one thing, and they do another.” No, we actually had
                    very strong statements, and were saying them right off the bat.</p>
                <p>So we would compile - and I still have a list of these, and they were just gems -
                    the statements made by the Secretary of State's spokesperson, Nick Burns, day
                    after day in the public briefings about our concern for this. And we just kept
                    issuing those and getting them passed out.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Now we didn't have email then, and we didn't have web sites. We had the handy,
                    you-sit-down-and-you-type it, and you fax it around, and you hand it to people,
                    and bring people in for briefings. So I did bring in different groups who would
                    call me. A lot of the domestic groups had no idea where Afghanistan was, they
                    didn't know what Taliban meant, they had no idea. But, they knew that girls
                    couldn't go to school, and that women couldn't leave their homes, or couldn't
                    work outside their homes. So there were just basic knee-jerk reactions to this.
                    Some of these groups came in to see me, and I would get a conference room and
                    sit down and talk with them about what I was doing. I said, “Maybe it's good for
                    you to meet the regional people too,” because I was thinking [laughter], “It's
                    important. I am not the expert in Afghanistan just yet.” I can tell you that
                    right now, I sure am! But I wasn't just then, three days back into the State
                    Department; and the Bureau people had been working on it for a long time.</p>
                <p>So I invited Lee in the open, transparent way we do business in the State
                    Department, to come meet these groups. I'd say, “Lee, they're here to express
                    their concerns. You're the policy guy on this. Please come and talk to them, and
                    while you may not agree with them, these are NGOs. This is the way we do
                    business, blah, blah, blah.”</p>
                <p>Well, it was a complete and utter disaster. Which NGO person did I have in there?
                    I had Marjorie Lightman, who is an acid tongue (and I'd say this right to her
                    face), sharp-witted, very opinionated NGO activist on human rights, who had
                    recently been working on women's human rights. She was with the International
                    League for Human Rights, I think, or the Lawyer's League for Human Rights, out
                    of New York. And we had?(I'm just trying to go around the table, and I remember
                    the faces) a wonderful man from Amnesty International named [T.] Kumar, who
                    himself was a victim of torture and was a very well respected human rights
                    activist here in Washington; and Suzanne Kindervatter from Interaction, who had
                    a lot of development experience; and these were pretty savvy people on foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: These were the groups that really knew foreign policy, and knew human
                    rights, women's rights, and foreign policy. They were becoming a very
                    knowledgeable group. So we probably had five or six people. And Lee Coldren
                    comes into the conference room, and you know, I grew up in the middle of a large
                    family, so I'm used to sort of like, “Oh, you're fighting, and you're fighting,
                    and you're not getting?okay, we all agree, right?” [Laughter] and I kind of knew
                    that was going to happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>But I was unprepared for the level of vitriol and disrespect. At one point Kumar
                    - and I knew it was really directed at me, but they couldn't come after me
                    because I was a State Department official - but Kumar, this wonderful NGO
                    fellow, says, “You know, why aren't we just doing blank, blank, blank?” and it
                    wasn't a stupid question. It was just a very direct thing. And this guy gets up
                    across the table and points a finger in this guy's face; I mean jumping across
                    the table. He would have hit him, but I knew it was really directed at me. He
                    said, “That's a stupid question! That's a really stupid question! And I'm not
                    going to answer stupid questions!” And I'm looking at him like, and I'm like,
                    “Oh my gosh, please don't hit him, please don't!” [Laughter] I'm laughing, but
                    it was really not fun at the time -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?because it was so deadly serious and so important that we opened up a
                    dialogue, and that the people who knew what was going on with the Taliban and
                    knew what had been going on in Afghanistan before hear from people who had every
                    legitimate right to be in this building expressing their views to policymakers.
                    So that was a complete disaster of a meeting, and he stormed off and said,
                    “That's it! I'm not talking to any more groups.” And I'm like, “Don't worry pal.
                    I won't be asking you! You should be helping me out explaining policy!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there anybody below him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, there was above him, I want to say, Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel,
                    who wasn't particularly engaged on this issue. And then, there were a couple of
                    people on the desk, or who were moving on to the desk, and that's where the
                    break came.</p>
                <p>But what happened with the NGOs was like, “Now we know what you're up against!”
                    And I said, “Well, that's one part of it. The other part of it, though, is the
                    Secretary of State's spokesman. Okay, he's not shaping policy, but he is
                    certainly putting out there what the Secretary's point of view is, and Nick was
                    not on his own.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: You know, Warren Christopher obviously supported this, and wanted us to
                    respond in a direct way, and Nick would keep referring back to the Beijing
                    Conference on Women. We had just said, as a country, this is what we thought,
                    and this is what we did, and we wanted to follow through on that. And if you
                    can't respond this way, it wasn't like something that was nuanced, or you had to
                    think through carefully. You may look at women's human rights, and have
                    different views on it - I can't imagine how anybody could - but how could
                    anybody say that this is not a basic violation, and a violation of the UN
                    charter</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>So it was quite challenging in letting the NGOs know that and trying to get some
                    support from the outside, and that actually ended up being helpful to me as I
                    continued to work past this. The breaks came. A wonderful guy named Donald
                    Cam-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, but what was the role of Tim Wirth, your</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, this was of concern to Tim, but Tim's primary focus was on
                    reproductive health and reproductive rights, and on population issues, and on
                    the environment. And I think this was of concern to him, but I don't think it
                    was a primary concern.</p>
                <p>His focus was really trying to integrate the population issues, and he did a job
                    on that by taking the Refugee Migration Office [Bureau of Refugee Programs] and
                    turning it into a bureau that included population, and that was a great struggle
                    to be able to do that and to really energize the Bureau of OES (Oceans,
                    Environment, and Science [Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and
                    Scientific Affairs]).</p>
                <p>But this wasn't really a central issue. I was something he was concerned with,
                    but it was “something I was going to do, but?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did he give you sort of free ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Free reign? Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?we're talking about a bureaucracy, and he's your boss,
                        and going over to Nick was -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I should probably look at my notes. Yes, well?it is a bureaucracy
                    except?did I have free reign? Certainly Tim supported my efforts. Tim never
                    blocked anything that I was trying to do here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Free reign!! [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>Actually there were meetings in Tim's office. Tim would have the Assistant
                    Secretaries in who were under (G), so it would be Drugs and Thugs, INL
                    (Assistant Secretary for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs),
                    PRM (Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees, and Migration), OES
                    (Assistant Secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific
                    Affairs), and maybe sometimes IO (Assistant Secretary for International
                    Organization Affairs). I would join those meetings, and we would hear what was
                    going on. Actually, you're reminding me of something wonderful.</p>
                <p>Meg Donovan, who is now deceased, but who worked within H (Bureau of Legislative
                    Affairs), as one of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries, and was an appointee from
                    the Hill, and has been a Democrat who had worked many years in Congress and was
                    a very energetic and outspoken person, called me after one of the meetings in
                    Tim's office and said, “So what are you going to do about the Taliban?” And this
                    was literally the second or first day I was back from the White House. I said,
                    “Well, I'm going to call over to the NSC, because I know who I can get working
                    on the NSC.” And she said, “Well, screw that!” sort of. She said, “Screw that!
                    You're in the State Department. You have to change this building. This is your
                    building. Forget the White House. This [knocking noise] is where you have to
                    work. You can't go over to?forget them?blah, blah. You have to do it here.” And
                    I was, “Yeah, I guess you're right.” And she said, “And, just talk to them down
                    in South Asia. I'm sure they're going to agree with you?you're going to be fine.
                    Just do it!” And that really did focus me that. I couldn't count on the NSC to
                    take care of this issue and I was supposed to be here at State. That oriented
                    me. So yes, I did certainly have support from staff, from Tim. We raised what we
                    were doing in the weekly meetings with the Assistant Secretaries; and I would
                    keep Tim up to date and fill him in on what we were doing. He was always
                    supportive of and liked my energetic approach, because he was such an activist
                    himself and had worked so hard to get the population and the environment issues
                    onto the front of the agenda.</p>
                <p>But we moved along. We got the good statements out there. We would deal with
                    everything we could because the Population, Refugees, and Migration Bureau, were
                    my other allies, particularly a fellow named Allen Jury, who had spent a great
                    deal of time on refugee issues related to Afghanistan. He was the fellow who was
                    going to the donor meetings on how all the donor countries who supported the
                    refugees who came out of Afghanistan and in the neighboring countries would
                    coordinate what they were going to do. The donor countries were going to these
                    meetings, (and I have to go back and check my notes as to when). But he was such
                    a great guy, because he was such a straight shooter and had such a wonderful way
                    of being able to develop a message and carry it into these donor meetings - it
                    made such a difference for us. What Allen said was, “We have to look at?”</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>I was very concerned. Are we going into these donor meetings and acting like it's
                    business as usual. “Well, we hope it all works out, but here is, you know, the
                    assistance we always gave you.” There had to be some difference. If you were
                    excluding girls and women from the distribution channel for food, and from
                    education, and from basic needs, are we, as a country, and all the other donor
                    countries going to ignore that and go on as though it was business as usual. And
                    Alan had the opinion that we shouldn't, and he didn't. It wasn't across the
                    board that everybody in his bureau agreed with him. But he was a very
                    intelligent Foreign Service officer, so he knew how to write the guidance cable.
                    And I asked to be on clearance for guidance cable, and it was like, “Well, no,
                    we don't clear outside?” But I was like, “Oh well, I'm in charge now of this
                    particular agenda.” It was just with the Taliban it became a much more
                    heightened position, because it was just focusing on this, and they had handed
                    me this issue. The Taliban was no nuanced situation. I remember working with
                    Allen and working very hard to make sure I was on every clearance, clearing all
                    the cables when the U.S. was sitting down at donor meetings.</p>
                <p>The other thing was, since Allen was really supportive of this and really wanted
                    to go to the donor meetings, saying that, “It's not business as usual. The
                    United States is going to have to look at how we distribute aid and what kind of
                    assistance we give, because we're not going to turn over the same kind of stuff
                    to the Taliban, and we're going to have to figure out how we can maneuver this
                    to make sure that women and girls get a fair shake and maybe develop some new
                    things because now they're being excluded from the basic services they had
                    before.”</p>
                <p>I invited that same group who had been in that terrible meeting with Lee Coldren
                    earlier to come in and have a conversation with Allen Jury from PRM. They came
                    in, and it was just wonderful. It was also terrific, because then they saw that
                    these kinds of meetings took place. Also, I thought it would be good for Allen
                    to get some support from outside, because Allen was used to working with refugee
                    groups and used to dealing with a lot of outside groups. But this was different;
                    this was the human rights community.</p>
                <p>So Allen Jury had this discussion with the NGOs, and it was very helpful because
                    he was used to dealing with outside groups, having worked a lot with refugees.
                    This is a different community - the human rights community and the women's human
                    rights community; but it really helped sort of lock in that we were going to
                    look at how, as a country, we provide assistance; and we were going to work and
                    try to influence other donor countries to kind of take our point of view - that
                    it's not business as usual and that we have to really take a look at what kind
                    of assistance - and that was huge and had far reaching effects!</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>But then again, it was the ally in PRM who helped do this; but he needed support
                    as well. So me being a clearance on the cables, we could do bad cop/good cop,
                    but I couldn't accept any mealy-mouth language, “Well, we'll take a look and see
                    what Japan said, and we'll see what the Brits say, and see what Canada says.”
                    You know, it had to be clear. “This is the U.S. point of view.” Now, the South
                    Asia Bureau [laughter] wasn't particularly keen on that, but they didn't pay
                    much attention to the humanitarian assistance side. They were interested more in
                    the political and military things.</p>
                <p>So, we were able to get this going. When Allen wasn't around, or if there was
                    someone meeting at the UN, it required monitoring of all the different
                    mechanisms, all the different ways that policies develop that were affecting
                    this country. It was a tremendous challenge, and ultimately we moved in the
                    right direction.</p>
                <p>What happened was that a very talented Foreign Service Officer, Don Camp, who had
                    a lot of experience in the region moved in. He had gone over to the NSC at some
                    point, and then had come back as one of the deputies. Lee Coldren, the dinosaur,
                    as we would call him because we had to have some humor in dealing with this,
                    because it was difficult, retired. It was hostile; I mean yelling! And I don't
                    like being yelled at, especially when I know I'm right [laughter]!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So when Lee retired, others came in. I don't know if Don took his place or
                    if he was a deputy. But Don came in, and he was really open to this and was
                    going to work on this and take on this issue. Then, after a few months passed
                    by, Warren Christopher moved out as our Secretary of State and Madeleine
                    Albright moved in as our Secretary of State. Rick Inderfurth [Karl Frederick
                    Inderfurth] became the Assistant Secretary for South Asia, and on one of the
                    first few days in the building he came to see me and said, “Let's talk about
                    Afghan women, about which I'm extremely concerned! I think it's very important
                    that we highlight that, and that the U.S. supports it and does everything we
                    can.” It was really good. And that made a big, big difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had a good, solid oral history with Rick Inderfurth,
                        yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, he was true-blue, terrific. At the same time, on the Afghan desk, two
                    fabulous Foreign Service officers came in, who became and still are good friends
                    of ours. Sheldon Rappoport, who was the senior fellow, who is now consul general
                    in Lahore, Pakistan and an extremely talented, stellar Foreign Service officer,
                    Tom Hushek, who I have great respect for. Tom later went out to be a Refugee
                    officer in Pakistan, going in and out of Afghanistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>Sheldon was really sophisticated and had a lot of experience with Rick, doing a
                    million things, and I knew we had his support, so it wasn't going to be
                    difficult. Don Camp was very experienced; Sheldon was a very clever diplomat;
                    and Tom Hushek - it was, you know, we had allies there.</p>
                <p>While we had allies; we still had to be the activists. We had to watch PRM; we
                    had to watch IO for anything going on in the United Nations; we had to watch the
                    group of countries surrounding Afghanistan, the “Stans”, and Russia and all the
                    surrounding countries who had a point of view about what's going on there. So we
                    had to watch what the U.S. was saying there. We also had to watch the cable
                    traffic from the field.</p>
                <p>But we had allies. Allies who were helped by our constantly watching, monitoring,
                    pushing for attention on the women's human rights issue in Afghanistan, bringing
                    in groups to meet them, and by our asking them to talk to people, because there
                    were so many elements of play. And, as things moved along more and more on the
                    Afghan and Taliban issues, I then wondered how they were going to react to the
                    drug trafficking issue, and later on to some of the terrorism issues, trying all
                    the time to keep women on the agenda. From my view, right there on the top of
                    the agenda, it was great to have that active, supportive team there; but it was
                    still our job to make sure that these things were treated fairly.</p>
                <p>I'd like to stop there if I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right then. When we pick this up the next time, I'd
                        like to start with several questions. What could you do when you were
                        dealing with a group like the Taliban? And, did you have media people that
                        you could deal with, in other words, get your issues on the front page of
                        the Washington Post and the New York Times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. And I'll mention the meeting I had with the Taliban as well.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 27 May 2003. Let's talk about the Taliban.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, one of the key goals of the Taliban was to get U.S. government
                    recognition for their government when they came into power in October of 1996.
                    When they came into Kabul, they pretty much thought that they would be
                    recognized by the international community as the government of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>One of my key purposes in life was to make sure the U.S. did not recognize them
                    [laughter]!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I think I talked a little bit about some of the efforts we made to make
                    sure that the statements that came out of Secretary of State Warren
                    Christopher's office expressed appropriate concern about the treatment of women
                    and the Taliban's edicts. But I think the effort of keeping this women's human
                    rights on the agenda, and in a prominent way on the agenda, really did help to
                    marshal the support of the international community not to recognize the
                    Taliban.</p>
                <p>I think we had the support of the other donor communities. We had very high-level
                    women at the UN (and I think I spoke about this), who had significant positions
                    of leadership - Cathy Bertini, who was head of the [UN] World Food Program, and
                    Carol Bellamy who was head of UNICEF (United Nations International Children's
                    Emergency Fund, its former name; now called United Nations Children's Fund) at
                    the time. They were determined not to continue their programs as if it was
                    business as usual. That made a very big difference to many of us working in
                    governments around the world, to know that there was senior leadership at the UN
                    who were going to make the point that when women and girls are excluded from all
                    the normal streams of society in life, that a country can't go forward, and the
                    international community can't just turn its head and say, “Well, that's
                    cultural,” because it's not cultural. It wasn't cultural before these guys came
                    in with guns; and people with guns shouldn't determine the culture of the
                    country. Of course, that's what the Afghan women said and continue to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: One of the memorable things was when the Taliban came through seeking
                    recognition. I think this was just after Madeleine Albright became Secretary of
                    State. Rick Inderfurth was the Assistant Secretary for South Asia; we had a very
                    good collaborative working relationship. Rick was very smart, very savvy, and
                    very strong on this issue.</p>
                <p>I asked for a meeting with the Taliban, so I could express my views and be able
                    to share with them the concerns of some of the groups we were working with here
                    in the United States, and of the Afghan women in exile that I had had so many
                    extensive, long meetings with. I also spoke to Muslim friends whom I had worked
                    with and known getting ready for the Beijing Women's Conference: to ask them how
                    I should appropriately address the Taliban; how to, you know, what they would
                    like to have expressed, because it wasn't appropriate for me to be referencing
                    the Koran or anything else. Of course the big message of the groups I had spoken
                    with was, “Your message is not based on Islam. You, Taliban, are wrong, and we
                    don't support what you're saying about girls' education and women's ability to
                    earn their own income, and the women's relationship to the family.”</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>It was a fascinating meeting because there were five or six men. One was pretty
                    savvy; you could say he was the PR (public relations) wing. I would say he was
                    probably not based in Afghanistan; he probably came from outside of Afghanistan,
                    because whatever question I asked, he would sort of come back with a snappy
                    response, which I thought was interesting.</p>
                <p>But one of the points I made was that I explained my position: what position I
                    had within the making of foreign policy, which was to promote and protect
                    women's human rights; what the Secretary of State had said about the U.S.
                    concern about this; but also to reference the United Nations and UN charters. I
                    could have been talking about nuclear physics as there seemed to be no
                    comprehension of any UN standard norms for human rights or anything else. But
                    then I asked very specifically, “You've closed down the schools and have
                    excluded girls from any schools, and yet you're talking about and moving ahead
                    to continue educating your sons. Don't you want your daughters to be educated
                    too?”</p>
                <p>And they said, “Well,” it was this PR guy who made this really big point, “the
                    main reason is that the Russians left behind these terrible books full of
                    propaganda, and girls are very weak and susceptible to that propaganda; so we
                    can't have the girls go to school. If UNICEF would just give us the appropriate
                    books,” and then they started ranting and raving about UNICEF and Carol Bellamy,
                    which I thought was fascinating. [Laughter] “If?if they would do that, then we
                    might find a place for the girls in school again.” And there were some other
                    basic things like that. But that was the memorable point.</p>
                <p>They were clearly angry at these UN officials who were getting in their way. I
                    know that Cathy Bertini particularly incurred the wrath of one of the senior
                    Taliban officials, because she was so direct and clear and was not going to go
                    ahead with the food distribution in Afghanistan if women weren't part of the
                    distribution chain, because they just weren't going to get the food. But this
                    guy did go on a rant about UNICEF and Carol Bellamy, which I thought was
                    interesting. In the course of it, the meeting took place around noontime,
                    individual Taliban members would get up and go into the corner and do their
                    prayers. It was a very interesting experience.</p>
                <p>I'm sure they didn't quite comprehend what my job was, but it really hit me then,
                    that they were so unpolished and ignorant, and I had met with a lot of people
                    all over the world. They were just, even with the PR guy, not in the realm of
                    understanding the world they were trying to influence and persuade. And that's
                    what a lot of my well-educated Muslim friends have said, that they were
                    uneducated Muslims.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, this is what came across so much. I mean in
                        doing things, there was nobody looking and saying, “Well, this might not be
                        a good idea,” or something like that -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Well, some of the practices of the Taliban were no worse than the
                    practices of some of the other warlords - Abdul Rashid Dostum and Gulbuddin
                    Hekmatyar and others. But then the Taliban were stupid enough to go in front of
                    CNN and make these ridiculous pronouncements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: This became their dominant driving force, and it would wax and wane
                    according to who was in control. And, they just never delivered anything to
                    their people either. When they took over government ministries, it wasn't to
                    improve the lives of their people.</p>

                <p>LOAR: It was for control. But they had nothing to offer other than control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I think when we finally went in there we found that
                        there was nothing really new. The Taliban had collected things from other
                        people and were essentially living off the property of a conquered
                        people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, and the drug trade -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?and al Qaeda. It turned out that al Qaeda were the power, and the Taliban
                    allowed al Qaeda to come in, and then al Qaeda was sponsoring them. The Taliban
                    were the sponsored conquerors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Al Qaeda gave them money.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>LOAR: Right, and that's what kept them going for a long time, because they even
                    had the drug trade cleaned up; they did some good work on that front. Al Qaeda
                    had unlimited resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They really didn't seem to understand the depth of our
                        hatred of al Qaeda and what we were about to do to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were several opportunities when the Taliban might
                        have made some sort of deal, which in a way would have been awful; but we
                        were after al Qaeda, not the Taliban.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But for what difference it made, I think the U.S. in not recognizing the
                    Taliban as the government sort of set a standard. But if the Taliban had turned
                    over al Qaeda and cooperated on terrorism, there might have been a different
                    outcome. I can't predict that. But it did set a particular standard - it did
                    hold back recognition of the government.</p>
                <p>But there were also a lot of programs that were developed through the Refugee
                    programs. Julia Taft was head of Population, Refugees, and Migration [Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration] at the time, and she
                    had a tremendously effective team there. Allen Jury is one of the people who
                    developed a lot of the sustainability programs for women who were in Afghanistan
                    and who were not able to get out, just to provide them with basic health
                    services to ensure their survival because they had such limited access to health
                    care. The Afghan women received training through some of the U.S. government
                    funded programs, through CARE and others, on how to keep their children alive or
                    avoid diarrhea in their children. So in the most extreme circumstances, I think
                    the U.S. assistance programs and the Refugee assistance programs did their very
                    best to be responsive and to empower the women without being shut down by the
                    Taliban; and I think that a lot of effort went into that.</p>
                <p>But I also think that if we hadn't as a country and as a government and as an
                    administration lived and gone through this big United Nations Conference on
                    Women in 1995, the year before, I don't think there would have been this
                    sharpened focus, and I think it would have been much tougher to hold back the
                    forces who wanted to recognize the Taliban and see them as a stabilizing
                    force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We may have touched on this before, but did you run across
                        any people in the Near Eastern Bureau, or later the South Asian Bureau, who
                        were looking and saying, “Well, yes, we've got problems here, but we really
                        should recognize the Taliban?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I don't know that there was anybody who was politically tone deaf
                    enough to say we should recognize them, but there was a prevalent attitude among
                    some that, “That's fine, but this is all going to get sorted out later on. This
                    is the way women are always treated in these countries, and we're not going to
                    tell these countries how to treat women,” and, “What is this, the flavor of the
                    month? What are we going to worry about next time?” This was the thing I heard
                    again and again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And it wasn't just related to the Taliban; we had it related to a lot of
                    other things.</p>
                <p>There were some who knew the country well, had served there, and had lived there
                    for many years, who said, “These guys are no worse than anybody else.” I had
                    recognized that. But the Taliban did lay down this line and were carrying out
                    these edicts. The U.S., as a government which had just gone to this United
                    Nations Conference and put out this important message that, “women's rights are
                    human rights” couldn't ignore that; this was a black and white case! This wasn't
                    whether or not women should get promoted at a certain rate, or whether women
                    should get the corner office. This was the basic human rights that are in the UN
                    charter. Our country was based on this. It was just basic participation and
                    access to food and health. So it was pretty clear and pretty black and
                    white.</p>
                <p>There was interest on the Hill, but it was mixed and sometimes pretty ill
                    informed. But our job, too, was to try to get information out to people about
                    what was happening and to really try to keep the focus on the degradation of the
                    lives of the women in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>There was a very good group called Physicians for Human Rights that did a whole
                    report. It was Holly Burkhalter and an Afghan-American woman, who did this
                    report on the health conditions of Afghan women under the Taliban. That was
                    fabulous because it showed the complete, total degradation and suffering the
                    Afghan women were experiencing. That was a human rights issue. This report
                    showed what was happening to women because they couldn't get to their doctors,
                    and because the Afghans wouldn't let women doctors be women doctors, and
                    wouldn't let women go to any doctors. And that was such a good case, for it's
                    not cultural; this is not, “Let that country decide what they're going to do
                    with their own people.”</p>
                <p>This was a basic, human concern. It was also a very good advocacy tool, I
                    thought, as we did a lot to highlight those findings as often as we could in
                    Hillary Clinton's speeches. She was always eager to talk about the conditions of
                    Afghan women. We held a human rights event at the White House in, I think, 1997,
                    that focused on Afghan women. Belquis Ahmadi, who is a very strong, talented,
                    young Afghan woman who's now living here in the United States and completing law
                    school and who I think will someday be running her country, came and spoke at
                    the White House. President Clinton, Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton were
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>We tried to draw attention to this as often as we could. We also tried to send a
                    signal to the community outside the government that we understood the situation,
                    and that we were not going to recognize this government. However, I don't know
                    if those words were ever spoken publicly by any official, “that we would not
                    recognize the Taliban.” But at the end of the day, we didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things about the people who were saying
                        that, “Well, this is just a cultural thing,” and all that, my impression is
                        that whatever the system was prior to the Taliban taking control, a lot of
                        talented Afghan women were doctors. There seemed to be a rather substantial
                        reservoir for that backward nation up in the middle of the mountains.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The Afghan women got the right to vote about the same time as American
                    women. In the '70s there was a cadre of professional women, a professional class
                    of women, in Kabul. In the countryside, there's no question that there's an
                    extremely high rate of illiteracy, that many women were covered with the
                    “burqa,” (the full-body veil created to hide women completely from the gaze of
                    men), and that women had a very inferior status to men in society. But in the
                    capital city of Kabul, women ran universities, and were lawyers and judges. So
                    it wasn't a valid claim to say it was cultural.</p>
                <p>Plus, the Taliban were not native. Many of them came from Pakistan and grew up in
                    these very isolated “madrassas” (religious schools), where they had very little
                    access to sisters, mothers, aunts, and all the memorable things that help
                    civilize and help a person develop and understand their role in the world. They
                    had very limited female interaction, and were taught by people who were not
                    Muslim scholars. As my Muslim friends would say, it would be impossible to have
                    read the Koran and to have really been trained by a Koranic scholar and to draw
                    the conclusions the Taliban did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So there was, you know, a lot working against accepting that idea, that it
                    was cultural, but it was still not always an easy thing to keep our views on top
                    of the agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another issue that you would see arise from the papers - I
                        don't think we've covered this, and this was particularly going towards
                        Africa - female genital mutilation and people claiming refugee status. Did
                        you get involved with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, a year after the Beijing Conference, when I left the White House, and
                    came back to the State Department to take on the position of Senior Coordinator
                    for International Women's Issues, one of the first issues I was hit with, in
                    addition to the Taliban, was female genital mutilation.</p>
                <p>The reason I was hit with this sort of very quickly early on was that members of
                    our Congress, at the time, including Pat Schroeder, had passed either a law, or
                    it was in a regulation, that the U.S. government had to withhold loans at the
                    World Bank and international financial institutions, to withhold any kind of
                    financial loans or aid programs (I think that was what it was), to any country
                    where this was practiced and where there were no educational programs in place
                    to address it. Pat Schroeder, who was always a strong advocate for women, put
                    this into place, as we understood, at the urging of American human rights
                    groups.</p>
                <p>But the American women and human rights community were severely criticized by the
                    African women who said, “This is not helpful to us, that our country's going to
                    get less aid and fewer loans because this practice takes place in our country.
                    Our government will be angry at us, and our people will suffer, and that's not
                    helpful that you did that!”</p>
                <p>So in my extreme naivet�, my idea that I could bring people together and get
                    people to agree to something, I called a meeting. There happened to be three or
                    four African women, who were leaders in the field of female genital mutilation,
                    in the United States at the time. One was a woman named Nahid Toubia, who was a
                    Sudanese surgeon. Another was a fabulous, beautiful woman from Somalia in her
                    late 50s, who was the first one to ever talk about it publicly and who did a
                    Ph.D. (doctor of philosophy) thesis in Somalia on it; she was a great hero to
                    other African women. There were some others. We invited them to an open meeting
                    in a beautiful conference room; it was Patrick Kennedy's, (A) conference room
                    (the best conference room, of course, is always in (A), Administration), with a
                    nice round table. We had the African women, and I invited the women from the
                    human rights community in the United States who were active in getting Pat
                    Schroeder and others to pass this law or regulation to come in and have an open
                    discussion about it.</p>
                <p>I did a little work ahead of time, and found out that the big concerns the
                    African women had were that, putting this issue on the human rights agenda was
                    not so good; it should be on the health agenda. Also, they didn't want American
                    women telling them what to do and not recognizing their efforts. So I sort of
                    worked out a policy statement ahead of time with the African women, and got the
                    American human rights groups to agree to that; it was a difficult, heated
                    discussion.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>One of the African women said, “I would never in a million years think I'd be
                    sitting at the U.S. Department of State on a policy discussion of this, and I
                    want to thank you, the U.S. government, for getting us space to talk about it.”
                    So that was positive in that way. I think the women in the human rights
                    community came to understand the concerns; it was actually a very positive
                    thing. We came up with a policy statement, which is that - I remember it still,
                    this was 1996, because it was difficult! - the U.S. government would work in
                    partnership with those governments, communities, and organizations on the ground
                    where this female genital mutilation is practiced to help eradicate this harmful
                    health practice. The outcome of that is a greater integration of awareness and
                    education against FGM (female genital mutilation) in our health programs through
                    AID and our commitment to talk about it as a harmful health practice. There was
                    also even controversy calling it female genital mutilation - whether it should
                    be cutting or mutilation. I did a program once with an African -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, mutilation, I guess, is a loaded word.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right?an African woman who said to me, “American women get these breast
                    implants. You mutilate your breasts deliberately and on purpose, and I don't see
                    or hear anybody saying that. We call it cutting.” So even the language of it was
                    something where we needed to listen to what the African women were saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There are some who called it circumcision, which sounded very harmless,
                    because circumcision for males is harmless. It doesn't affect your reproductive
                    system and your ability to have children, or whether or not you can have a -</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, that's another horrible thing.</p>
                <p>We did have an expert in the State Department, Lois Gochnauer, who was an expert
                    in that she would write the country profiles where this was practiced; and that
                    was helpful to the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) and for those
                    people who were seeking asylum, based on whether it was practiced in their
                    country; and Lois was the expert on country to country and on where this was
                    practiced.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>And I'll say something just completely off the record here [laughter], I had a
                    friend who was very witty and clever, and she said, “If you look at the basic
                    fear of women's sexuality and fear of women being able to enjoy their sexuality
                    - because that's what this practice does, is to remove any enjoyment of
                    sexuality with a lot of other damaging effects - it was amazing it didn't catch
                    on with some of the other faiths, because the whole idea of so many other faiths
                    is to control women's sexuality.” [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: “And it's amazing it didn't catch on in some of the other faiths.” But it
                    wasn't really faith based, because it wasn't in Islam, and it wasn't exclusively
                    in the Islamic countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: In Senegal, for example, there's a tremendous model for ending the
                    practice, and it came from the village. And there are some other countries, like
                    Egypt, where they imposed a law and tried to do it from the top down, which is
                    less successful. But in Senegal, it was like village elders, including male
                    village elders, convinced that this was a harmful health practice, that was not
                    going to improve their country, or be good for their village. So that was one of
                    the tougher things.</p>
                <p>So, in the fall of '96, I walked into tough issues, but it really was what the
                    position was all about. That's why the women and human rights community created
                    that position - have someone focused full time on promoting and protecting
                    women's human rights within foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very important! I have just sort of a historical
                        aside. Here I am talking to you about this, I'm 75 years old, and brought
                        up, I guess, in a fairly traditional mode. I just ran into this problem in
                        talking to a missionary doctor in what was then the Trucial States, now the
                        United Arab Emirates; she was talking about how she had to deal with this
                        problem there back in the '50s. I was horrified. I had never heard of this
                        before, and it has always stuck in my mind how horrible this thing was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. One of the good things about what Pat Schroeder did in the law was to
                    make it illegal in the United States, which was important, because it wasn't
                    illegal. Now, HHS had the responsibility to reach out to the immigrant
                    communities and to educate the medical community with an immigrant community in
                    mind. That was fascinating, working with HHS and encouraging HHS to do that,
                    because they really had to train doctors - this is what it is. So, some of these
                    women from Africa who were experts in it would be part of these outreach efforts
                    to the immigrant communities, and I actually got a call in my office, and then
                    another call came into the Op Center after-hours from doctors who were asked to
                    perform this practice in the United States and wanted to know what to do. And of
                    course, I wasn't the health expert. I had to tell them it was illegal, but that
                    we had an emergency number at HHS they could talk to, which could reach out to
                    them, which was really interesting. It's not that it doesn't happen; I'm sure
                    it's still practiced in some communities. But, I thought that educating the
                    health community in the United States, especially those people that served the
                    refugee and immigrant communities, was a very valuable way to get going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, even circumcision, which was standard practice in my
                        time, is now much more debatable, but might still cause all sorts of uproar
                        in the Jewish community.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But anyway, were there any other issues that you got
                        involved with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, one of the issues that arose was the issue of human trafficking. We
                    started off with trafficking women and girls, and then understood that it
                    included boys as well. So we'd say trafficking in persons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was brought to me through a variety of ways. One way that it hit me in
                    the face was at the first conference that we did for Vital Voices, the Vital
                    Voices Democracy Initiative, and the idea that vital voices, women's voices, are
                    essential to the development of any democracy. That was in July 1997. The first
                    conference was organized and sponsored by Swanee Hunt, who was our ambassador to
                    Vienna at the time. The idea was to bring together emerging women leaders, and
                    delegations of women, from all the countries in the former Soviet Union for a
                    meeting in Vienna, which sounded like a very straight forward thing to do. I'll
                    talk about Vital Voices in a little bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>One of the issues that arose from that meeting was this horror of women and
                    children being sold into modern-day slavery. It's very hard for people to
                    comprehend that that was happening; very hard for them to comprehend that it was
                    happening here in the United States. We now know there are some 50,000 people a
                    year who are sold and end up in slavery-like conditions in the United States,
                    and that's on farms, in factories, in private homes, in brothels and in the sex
                    industry. They come from all over the world, and it's based on economic
                    hardship. Women are lured from their home countries and children are pushed out
                    by their families because of the extreme economic conditions that they face.</p>
                <p>This journalist, Victoria Pope from U.S. News &amp; World Report, took me to
                    lunch when she returned from Russia. She was an investigative reporter for U.S.
                    News &amp; World Report at the time. This was sometime in the beginning of 1997.
                    She told me, “I just came from Russia, and you should know that there's a whole
                    industry of selling Russian women into the United States, and they end up in
                    places, for example, like New Brunswick, New Jersey.” Now I had gone to Rutgers
                    College, graduated from Rutgers College in New Jersey, and I was envisioning New
                    Jersey and Rutgers, and I couldn't believe that there were Russian women who the
                    police would pick up and say, “Oh, they're prostitutes,” and deport them; and
                    then the criminals, the traffickers who would trade them, would pick them up on
                    the other end and sell them into another country. This was just shocking and
                    very difficult to comprehend! It really became a major focus of our work on the
                    interagency side because we had this government task force on women, the
                    President's Interagency Council on Women, which included government
                    representatives from every federal agency.</p>
                <p>So while I was focusing on women's human rights in foreign policy as the Senior
                    Coordinator for International Women's Issues, I also had this responsibility, as
                    Director of this President's Interagency Council on Women, to coordinate
                    government-wide activities for women. So when this issue of trafficking came up,
                    and we saw Ukrainian women talking about this in this conference in Vienna and
                    Russian government officials putting their hands up to say, “It's overwhelming;
                    we can't even address it,” it was clear that we needed to develop a government
                    response to this. It was very helpful to have this government-wide
                    responsibility and mechanism to be able to address it because it's such an
                    overwhelming issue: it's a human rights issue, it's an issue of organized crime;
                    it's an issue of migration to the United States, and it's a health concern. That
                    involved a number of cross-agency responsibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>We had a very strong team that came together to address this; it sort of evolved.
                    We were able to recruit a very talented lawyer named Steve [Stephen] Warnath,
                    who had been at the White House Office on Crime, and before that at the Justice
                    Department, and who not only had experience in White House policy, but also in
                    crime, and who knew people at Justice Department very well. Anita Botti, who is
                    still at the State Department and was one of the top people in Population,
                    Refugees, and Migration Bureau, and who had a lot of experience with refugees
                    and migration, came over. We really developed this concept. We began by asking:
                    “Okay, what are the issues that we need to face?” We invited people in from the
                    human rights community; we held a lot of public briefings about this; we really
                    wanted to look at this issue, and to learn what we could, and to see what would
                    be an effective government response.</p>
                <p>So we would hear from the human rights community that you have to balance your
                    team with Martina Vandenberg, for example, at Human Rights Watch (they wrote
                    terrific reports about this to help define the issue), and that you couldn't
                    just look at protecting the victims, without also looking at prosecuting the
                    criminals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Or one or the other, and then the other is prevention, so warning people
                    off.</p>
                <p>So we developed this prevention, protection, and prosecution, and that became
                    sort of the base for the policies and programs that we developed and ultimately
                    of the law that was passed in the year 2000, the Victims of Trafficking and
                    Violence Protection Act of 2000.</p>
                <p>This was an all-involving issue in that the more people learned about it, the
                    more action that was required for people to take. It was very, very valuable to
                    have the State Department base, but also the interagency mechanism; and Anita
                    and Steve did tremendous work in pulling together people in the other government
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>At the Justice Department, for example, there are victims in the United States
                    who needed protection, but traffickers who needed to be prosecuted, and a whole
                    range of other issues. HHS had health concerns, and also refugee responsibility
                    with resettling refugees. Ultimately, we needed to help define the issue. We
                    were able to get a report out. We had Amy O'Neill Richard, who was an analyst in
                    INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research), and was a candidate for a special CIA
                    program called the Exceptional Analyst Award. We all worked hard to get Amy that
                    Exceptional Analyst Award so that she could sit in our office as her home base
                    and study trafficking for years. She issued the definitive report. It was the
                    first report done by the U.S. government in 1999. There hasn't been an update
                    since, but it's the one that came up with the estimates of numbers from around
                    the world and the 50,000 here in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>But we also had a lot of cooperation from a number of different parts of the CIA
                    in looking at the traffickers. In looking at human traffickers, we had a lot of
                    the CIA focused on drug trafficking - who were the traffickers, what were their
                    roots, how were they able to accomplish this. There was a lot of cooperation
                    there.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of challenges. There were many challenges and different points
                    of view within the Justice Department, because there are a lot of competing
                    agendas. That was an interesting and complicated mix of very talented people
                    working in our Justice Department.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of interest and support from Hillary Clinton's office. Melanne
                    Verveer, who was Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, was very interested and
                    supportive of this effort.</p>
                <p>We also had a lot of outreach too in connection with the faith community because
                    they would come in to tell us that there were women who were seeking asylum and
                    seeking help from the faith community, and they don't know where to turn because
                    there's no law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: As we were going to be leaving government at the end of 2000, and were
                    unsure of what would happen next, we wanted to be sure we left a permanent
                    policy approach, which was prevention, protection, and prosecution, and also a
                    government structure that would respond to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there's also a problem. I don't know how you dealt
                        with it, and I'm speaking on outmoded knowledge. But being a prostitute made
                        you ineligible for a visa, and I can see where a woman who got caught up in
                        this thing would find herself in a catch-22. If she testified, or something
                        like this, she was declaring herself ineligible. I mean this must have been
                        a very difficult nut to crack.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, it is difficult. But, no one would consciously put themselves in
                    these circumstances. No one would willingly come in to the United States and be
                    subjected to slavery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So regardless of what somebody's hope was, or how they hoped to earn their
                    income, at the end of the day, no one would deliberately put themselves in these
                    circumstances. So it was a great challenge.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>We had some interest from Capitol Hill. Congressman Chris Smith [Christopher H.
                    Smith] from New Jersey was a tremendous advocate on behalf of trafficked women.
                    He was very active on the Helsinki Commission [U.S. Commission on Security and
                    Cooperation in Europe], and he actually introduced the first piece of
                    legislation to put this into law. We had Sam Brownback [Samuel Dale Brownback],
                    a Republican from Kansas, on the Senate side; and the late Paul Wellstone was a
                    Democratic leader in the Senate; and there was another member of Congress,
                    [Samuel Gejdenson], who was on the Democratic side in the House, who was not
                    reelected, who was the Democratic sponsor (I wish I could remember his name,
                    that would be helpful).</p>
                <p>We worked closely with them to get this idea of prevention, protection, and
                    prosecution out and to be sure that it wasn't just sex trafficking which was
                    addressed because the traffickers, these criminal networks, did not select only
                    people to work in brothels. They would go into a village in India, for example,
                    and they would assure the parents that their young adult children from 10 to 16
                    would be well taken care of. Then they would whisk them out of the country and
                    beat them and subject them to horrific human rights violations. They would split
                    them up. Some would work in rug factories, some would work on farms, and some
                    would work in brothels. So to limit it just to sex trafficking was too limiting
                    and Congressman Smith was open to that and did expand that. That was very
                    important because otherwise you skew the focus and you don't really get at the
                    issue.</p>
                <p>Hillary Clinton was a tremendous advocate for this in that she would, on her
                    overseas trips, try to call attention to the issue. I remember the first time
                    she talked about this in a very open way and actually visited some of the
                    locations where this was. One of those countries that was being affected was
                    Thailand in 1997; she went to Chiang Mai in the north and met with families
                    where the girls had come back, girls who had been lured into trafficking. Of
                    course it's a horrible issue in Thailand. And, there's so many young women,
                    girls and children, actually from Burma, who were sold into slavery.</p>
                <p>That was a very dramatic trip and time because what we were trying to do was call
                    attention to some of those programs that would reintegrate the girls, some of
                    whom had now become HIV positive. We were also trying to show models of these
                    reintegration programs that worked, where the girls had a little further
                    education beyond the compulsory age of education. If the families could see that
                    investing in the girls and the girls' ability to get further education was
                    better for the family, they would be able to return more to the family and they
                    became more valuable to the family. That was sort of a positive approach. It was
                    also in a series of UN meetings that we called to deal with this issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>Now on a policy front, Madeleine Albright would raise this, and I always knew
                    when she did because I'd hear from the DAS [laughter], the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary, who covered that country, and pretty quickly. For example, when she
                    met with the prime minister of Italy on the margins of the G8, in 1998 I think,
                    she raised it and said, we need to be working more cooperatively. The Italians,
                    actually, had a lot to teach us. We had a very strong relationship with the
                    Italians. They led the world in protection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They were terrific in offering protective services to Nigerians and
                    Albanians who found themselves traded in open slave markets in Italy. Then I'd
                    hear pretty quickly from the Italian embassy and the DAS for the European Bureau
                    who covered Italy, that, “Oh, we have got to be working with you. Well, let's do
                    things!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Our role was really to be advisors and consultants to the regional bureaus
                    because dealing with trafficking shouldn't be housed in one place. Our thought
                    was that it was important that there be a place to coordinate the policy but
                    that the regional bureaus should develop policy as they work with the embassies,
                    and those partnerships were really strong and effective. So it was very helpful
                    when Madeleine would raise this, and it would filter down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it puts it on the agenda -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?and once it's on the agenda -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And the governments know it's of concern, because, when Madeleine Albright
                    raised this, it's of concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: She raised it as well in Israel, and that was a little bit harder for that
                    bureau to take that on board as something that they wanted her to raise, first
                    of all -</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?which she was going to do! They wouldn't clear on the papers. I got a call
                    from Madeleine Albright's plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Distracting. You know that's a distracting issue. It'd be like this was not
                    only a flavor of the month, but a distraction from the main agenda, which was
                    the other refrain I heard frequently ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?which I could understand. I didn't accept it, but I could understand where
                    it came from because this has nothing to do with the U.S.-Israeli relationship;
                    why are you messing it up with this?</p>
                <p>But there was a front-page article in the New York Times, which was based on a
                    report that Martina Vandenberg from Human Rights Watch had done, about Russian
                    and Ukrainian women being trafficked into Israel. Madeleine Albright or her team
                    read that on one of her flights to Israel to meet with Binyamin Netanyahu, and
                    called our office from the plane. It was dark, so it must have been late. I
                    don't remember the exact time, but it was not in the morning that we got this
                    call that she wanted to raise this. So like let's give her the briefing papers,
                    talking points, and everything she needed. That call came from the Op Center to
                    our office.</p>
                <p>However, the bureau, and I guess it was NEA, didn't quite agree with Madeleine
                    Albright's desire to do this, which I thought was stunning! The last time I
                    checked, she was the boss! We had to find out right away. It was very difficult
                    because there was an extraordinarily ineffective, over-financed program to try
                    to figure out where trafficking was illegal and all this stuff; and I was trying
                    to get information from that, and couldn't quite get it. That was funded by one
                    of the other bureaus at the State Department, so it was difficult. We tried to
                    figure out several things: what the actual status was; was there a law against
                    it; how prevalent is was; and finally, while we have this human rights report,
                    does our own government have anything? And it was very hard to get any of that
                    information. But we were able to cobble something together.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>They wouldn't clear, and the NEA Bureau wouldn't clear it because they just
                    didn't think it was appropriate for her to raise this. [Laughter] But she did
                    raise it, and the follow-up was difficult because they thought, “Well, you may
                    have done that, but no one's going to actually go forward with it.” There wasn't
                    a strong interest from the Israeli government on trying to address that; and it
                    was very complicated because it was the Russian immigrants who are involved in
                    this and that was a whole political issue for them.</p>
                <p>And then Madeleine Albright raised it with the Ukrainian government as well,
                    which was important because they did want to be very open about it and they
                    wanted a partnership with the U.S. We ended up doing some very effective
                    programs with the Ukrainian government. The State Department and the White House
                    got involved, as well, in training prosecutors and the enforcement community.
                    Actually, it's a model that has been duplicated in other places.</p>
                <p>We raised this issue publicly, and offered some approaches to it, because the
                    idea of slavery and its profitability is so overwhelming. We tried to develop a
                    policy framework of prevention, protection, and prosecution, and then tried to
                    constantly define it that way and then to try to build the capacity of our
                    government to respond.</p>
                <p>In pushing towards the law, a lot of other elements were drawn in. There were
                    people who were involved in (the whole story needs to be told at some point) how
                    the trafficking law was developed: there were a great number of people in the
                    religious and faith communities who were involved in the religious freedom bill,
                    who also wanted to develop a similar punitive law on sex trafficking. Since we
                    were interested in making permanent these approaches on trafficking, and having
                    an organized, functioning, coordinating government mechanism, we wanted to have
                    a common agenda within our government. But, there was some point there where it
                    didn't go forward as a common agenda, and became difficult. We also had
                    negotiations going underway with the United Nations on a new protocol on
                    organized crime. And, we developed one on trafficking as well that became a
                    flash point: people from the far Right and the far Left tried to distort that to
                    say that it wasn't addressing prostitution, therefore we must be promoting
                    prostitution. It became a flashpoint and got in the way of a lot of good work
                    that could have been done. To this day that nonsense carries on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the problem? Was it that prostitution
                        wasn't mentioned, or was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, this is an issue that's been going on for more than 20 years in the
                    feminist community. In the context of trafficking and the effort to end the
                    trafficking of persons, which puts people into modern-day slavery, we were
                    trying to use every mechanism we could to build an international consensus
                    around the issue; so we went into the UN. There was a protocol being developed
                    under the organized crime and drug control part of the United Nations. It was a
                    convention on organized criminal activity and there was one part having to do
                    with a protocol on trafficking that the U.S. proposed. So this protocol just on
                    human trafficking would be part of a larger convention. This was in 1999, I
                    think, that this was being negotiated. Our position as a government was to try
                    to get other countries on board with the prevention, protection, and prosecution
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>It was interesting that a number of countries (China for one, and Russia) who
                    don't particularly care about fighting organized crime and don't really care too
                    much about human rights were very concerned about trafficking because their own
                    citizens, especially the younger generation, were very affected by this. They
                    felt that they had to respond in some way. So we were able to draw those
                    countries in.</p>
                <p>It was a very effective way of going at the issue. And, while it was organized
                    crime, we had to work very hard. There was tremendous work because if you get
                    into any UN setting, you're always going to have a lot of sides pulling and
                    pushing at an issue; but it was very important that we made sure that victims'
                    protection was well written into that.</p>
                <p>In the middle of all this, there was some alliance that developed between the
                    extreme Right in the United States and the extreme Left, who decided to come
                    together to make this instrument an instrument against prostitution and to end
                    prostitution in all forms. As I said, there was this ongoing debate within the
                    feminist community for 20 years, which I have to say I never particularly tuned
                    into, but was drawn into. On the one hand, some believed that prostitution was
                    inherently exploitative and harmful to women and should be outlawed (and that's
                    my point of view). It is illegal here in the United States. So as a government,
                    of course, that was our point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: There were others that thought that prostitutes are in that situation for
                    whatever reason, and that they're workers, and their rights should be protected,
                    and they should have workers' rights and health benefits available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have been things in San Francisco and other places
                        -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, right.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?you know, saying, I mean, “We're workers.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So there's that point of view, and if we look within the UN context, there
                    are countries around the world where prostitution is not illegal. For example,
                    it's not illegal in Israel, in France, and in Holland, I think, and several
                    other countries.</p>
                <p>So there are some who would say “that's an interesting issue, but we're really
                    looking at selling human beings into slavery, and the sex trafficking is one
                    piece of it; so let's focus on what we're trying to do,” and that was our point
                    of view as a government, and that is what we were trying to do.</p>
                <p>However, there were some who thought this would be a really great time to make
                    the point that prostitution was bad, and that we should end prostitution. They
                    distorted, and do to this day distort, the position of what the U.S. was trying
                    to do in that UN meeting. And there were groups who decided to come together and
                    said very openly and directly that the administration's point of view at this
                    meeting is that if you're not going to end prostitution, you're really promoting
                    it, and you're supporting it. And that bizarre, ridiculous, outlandish statement
                    just kept bouncing, and bouncing, and bouncing, because, of course, it became a
                    political attack against Hillary Clinton. Because groups like Equality Now from
                    the Left decided to hold the point of view that if you're not ending
                    prostitution, you're really promoting it. And groups like?I can't even remember
                    the names of the groups - it was more the individuals on the Right deciding to
                    come together. This was interesting to the press, and the New York Post, which
                    is not known for its unbiased point of view, did a headline called Hillary's
                    Hooker Panel. This referred to the [President's] Interagency Council on Women,
                    and listed Anita Botti, Steve Warnath and me as those on Hillary's hooker panel,
                    who were promoting prostitution. I thank God my mother doesn't read the New York
                    Post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But my friend Anita Botti's father said, “Well honey, at least the
                    prostitutes will like you!”</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>LOAR: ?which was not our goal. But it became a very damaging and destructive
                    distraction from the important work of getting countries together. It was
                    ill-informed and ignorant and politically motivated. It was a distraction, and
                    still is a distraction (and that's another long story, as to how this issue's
                    being addressed now in the United States under the law that's being passed, and
                    not being implemented as it should be). The U.S. made very firm statements, that
                    we do not support prostitution, that it is illegal in the United States, and
                    that we think it's exploitative of women. Those are on the State Department's
                    web site. I've had to remind people of those on a regular basis, but facts don't
                    get in the way of someone who has a political agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Some of these groups said, “We don't care about resources for these women.
                    We don't care about taking care of these boys who are sold into these
                    sweatshops. We want to make the point that prostitution is bad.” Well, it's hard
                    to find people, anyone on earth, who thinks prostitution is good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But beyond that, it was a fairly ineffective, damaging, and destructive
                    distraction to this overall issue.</p>
                <p>But I'll go back to the main issue and talk about how this got caught up into the
                    law and everything else, but at the end of the day, Congressman Chris Smith,
                    Brownback and Wellstone prevailed. The point of view we shared with them was
                    that this is an inherent evil. Trafficking people into slavery denies them of
                    their basic human rights, and we, as a country, have to stand up against it and
                    treat people who were trafficked in the United States as victims and provide
                    them with refugee services and help them. We have to aid in the prosecution of
                    their traffickers. The United States has a responsibility to help countries
                    around the world address this issue, to help them with prevention, protection,
                    and prosecution. That's what the law says.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>The other part of the law is there because there was a faction who wanted some
                    punitive tool within this law to damage and punish countries that didn't address
                    this issue. A compromise was that there would be a Trafficking in Persons Report
                    issued once a year, and that this would be an important way of ranking countries
                    according to how they addressed this issue - the old standard ranking way we do
                    on some other things. I've never thought that was particularly effective, but it
                    was a compromise. The sad thing is that because of this ranking and the
                    reporting, this has become like the drug trafficking report; people spend all
                    their time trying to get up the list rather than trying to do things. I have
                    heard from some people that the list is helpful; it calls the attention of
                    governments. I think what's less helpful is that when they issue the report
                    every year, we don't also say (and it's been issued twice, it'll be issued again
                    in July 2003, a few months from now), while these are the countries we had the
                    greatest concerns about, we are working with citizens in that country, some
                    faction of government, to help empower them to stand up to this human rights
                    violation and this organized criminal activity. I think that we're abdicating
                    our responsibility as a government when we don't do that.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, the law got passed. It was a great moment. I remember the trip
                    to Thailand that I took with President and Mrs. Clinton in 1997. Bill Itoh
                    [William H. Itoh] was our ambassador at the time. When we came down from Chiang
                    Mai with Mrs. Clinton and joined the president's party in Bangkok, the big event
                    and the whole focus of the president's trip, was for President Clinton to sign a
                    repatriation treaty, which was for the repatriation of profits from American
                    companies so that there was a better tax arrangement between the governments of
                    Thailand and of the United States. And I thought, “well, that's like really not
                    that exciting. I can't believe this is the focus of the whole trip! I'd like to
                    see the president sign something that really affects the lives of women all
                    around the world some day.” However, as I stood in the Oval Office in October of
                    the year 2000 while the president signed the trafficking law into act, I
                    recognized that it was possible to take these issues and it was possible to get
                    the highest level of attention; and that with good, strong legislative support,
                    to actually put something permanent in place that would address the issues that
                    affected so many women and children around the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, I take it you left when Clinton??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: At the end of the Clinton administration, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you had institutionalized some dealings
                        with women that hadn't been there before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>LOAR: There are actually two things that I'd like to talk about next time as far
                    as institutionalizing, because as a former Foreign Service officer, that was my
                    heart's desire, and I saw that as a mandate. It's a lot harder to do than to be
                    able to get the support of the Secretary of State, just because she was so on
                    board with this agenda; the First Lady was also such a leader. One thing is to
                    make the speeches, and that was very powerful, very important, because that set
                    the tone. But in institutionalizing, you have to get people to internalize
                    it.</p>
                <p>Why they value it and why it's important to give awards to people was the other
                    part of it. I felt that was my responsibility to make sure that that happened,
                    and I think we were successful at that in several ways. Secretary Powell has
                    decided to continue the position of the Senior Coordinator for International
                    Women's Issues. It was an action memo that went up to the Secretary from the
                    Undersecretary for Global Affairs (Paula Dobriansky in this current
                    administration). They had polled a number of the regional and functional
                    bureaus, including the Economic Bureau, asking what they thought, and there was
                    an affirmative response that this position was helpful to the work that they
                    were trying to do. So I took that as a sign of success, that we had made some
                    progress in trying to institutionalize it.</p>
                <p>But I can talk next time about trafficking and the response of our embassies, and
                    how they viewed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then the Vital Voices conferences and how we started Democracy
                    Network.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know it's beyond your State Department career, but let's
                        talk about Vital Voices too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Okay. The third thing I want to talk about, and this is really a State
                    Department function, and it had a huge impact, was the role that Craig Johnstone
                    and his office [Office of Resources, Plans &amp; Policy] played. It was the idea
                    of putting our resources and our policies together in a “foreign affairs
                    account.” Craig Johnstone took our office as a model of an emerging issue, and
                    of how you get appropriately resourced in the mission program plan design; that
                    second thing had had a huge effect on how we were able to move ahead with these
                    issues, as the regional bureaus couldn't get their plans approved if they didn't
                    put trafficking and democracy building in their plans. That was one of the most
                    significant things we could have done for institutionalizing it. So I'd like to
                    talk about that - which will be of interest for State Department people
                    [laughter]!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>LOAR: People outside may not find it that particularly exciting, but it is!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, it's very important. I think back to Patt Derian
                        [Patricia M. Derian, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and
                        Humanitarian Affairs, 1977 - 1981] and putting human rights on everybody's
                        agenda, which hadn't been included before. This included an awful lot of
                        inter-bureau fighting and a lot of tooth gnashing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. And the other thing was the language: what worked, and what didn't.
                    It was using the language of “women's rights” that can mean many different
                    things. People see that as sort of aggressive and a throwback to the '70s. And,
                    “women's human rights,” well, nobody really knew what that meant. However, using
                    the word “democracy” helped us an awful lot. Packaging in the idea of the full
                    empowerment of women, and women as active participants in society, and calling
                    it “democracy,” I think, was helpful. And so I'd like to talk about that the
                    next time we get together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Well, we'll do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is 25 June 2003, only six months to go to Christmas.
                        So I guess you've sent your cards out already!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well anyway -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Getting all set.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the embassies and their response to
                        trafficking and that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>LOAR: On the issue of trafficking, I think in Washington we probably talked about
                    a government-wide response and recognizing we needed numbers to quantify the
                    problem. So we needed the CIA's help and engagement, and we needed Justice for
                    their ability to look at prosecuting cases and the protection of the victims.
                    There were some prosecutors already very active in this at Justice, who were
                    using a variety of criminal statutes, under Al Moskowitz [Albert Moskowitz] and
                    Louis deBaca, who is a terrific prosecutor to this day. We also needed HHS to
                    try to find ways that the victims who are brought here could have available to
                    them some of the services that refugees have available to them. And, of course,
                    we needed the Labor Department, because this is slavery and forced labor here in
                    the United States. We knew that we needed to build a government structure, so we
                    started?I just don't remember if we went and talked about the event at the White
                    House where we issued an executive memorandum from the president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: We did? Okay. This was really a very good thing because it gave us the
                    authority and empowered us, as the President's Interagency Council on Women, to
                    be able to build this government structure. It also helped us because in putting
                    together the executive memorandum, we were able to bring together the agencies
                    to see: can you do this; is this something that's in your capacity; even if
                    you're not able to do it now, do you see there's value in this. So it wasn't
                    that we were hitting people over the head; we were bringing people together on a
                    common task.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Central Intelligence Agency come into this?
                        They've been brought into the drug trafficking business, and I was wondering
                        whether they got into this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, it was actually very helpful to us because the President's
                    Interagency Council on Women included high-level representatives from every
                    federal agency. We had good contacts over at the CIA, and that was very helpful
                    in the development of two things: one, trafficking was the most important one.
                    Anita Botti had come over from PRM (Population, Refugees, and Migration) to help
                    us put together a strategy on how to deal with trafficking. She and Steve
                    Warnath, who had come over from the White House with a background on fighting
                    criminal activity and on developing policy on crime, were both were very
                    helpful. I don't remember the sequence of it, but we knew we needed to quantify
                    the criminal activity in trafficking and also know who these traffickers were,
                    because people didn't really know who made up these criminal networks. That was
                    something we thought the CIA could help with. INR at the State Department was
                    less than enthusiastic about helping on that, which surprised me because I
                    thought that would be an emerging issue they would want to jump on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it'd be kind of fun, getting -</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>LOAR: It was not considered a priority, which is unfortunate. Amy O'Neill, who
                    was one of the analysts at INR was always very interested in our issues, had
                    heard about this program called Exceptional Analysts Program that the CIA had.
                    You could devote a year of your time. You could apply for the Exceptional
                    Analyst Program; I think one was chosen a year. You would be funded, have a
                    travel budget, and you would devote a year to a particular issue. You had
                    products and reports. We, through our friends there, heavily supported Amy's
                    candidacy for this particular program, and she was chosen as the exceptional
                    analyst. She came and sat in our office and worked closely with Anita Botti.
                    That was what they called the CIA Report on Trafficking. That came out, I think,
                    in 1999, though, of course, it was written by a State Department person on the
                    program.</p>
                <p>So that report that came out that quantified the trafficking was one big
                    breakthrough that helped us a lot. I remember this team of people from the CIA
                    (and I don't remember the section, I just remember their faces) coming in and
                    meeting a lot with Anita, and Steve, and myself to look at trafficking routes,
                    and at whether the people involved in trafficking were involved in other illegal
                    activity, who they were; could we start developing some intelligence on who
                    these people were. They were very enthusiastic about it. They did an awful lot
                    of work although I don't think we got regular briefings. I do know that there
                    were briefings up the line at the CIA and up the line at State. That was very
                    helpful to us because people started understanding that this is not like some
                    mom-and-pop operation, and that there were very high-end criminal networks
                    involved, in addition to the mom-and-pop, opportunistic traffickers who pop up
                    here and there. So that was really helpful to get the CIA engaged and fun to
                    work with these guys over at the CIA who saw this as a new chance to start
                    putting this into the system. There were all these procedures for starting to
                    collect intelligence: find out who the people were, develop or get information
                    on trafficking routes, and all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing, at that time, any conjunction with drug
                        smuggling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, in some cases, the people involved in smuggling humans were the same
                    people involved in smuggling drugs and weapons. We certainly saw that there were
                    a lot of parallels in the issue, but there were some major distinctions as well.
                    When you traffic drugs, you are trafficking a substance or a plant, which is
                    consumed, and that's the end of it. When you smuggle and traffic human beings,
                    it's a human being who's still alive after being put into slavery at the end of
                    this, and then is transferred again to somewhere else and in another terrible
                    condition of slavery.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>So there were differences. It was actually always a challenge to help people see
                    and remember those differences. These were some of the discussions we had with
                    our friends in the Drugs and Thugs Bureau, who were really geared up to fight
                    drug trafficking. We tried to instill the sensibility that it is a human being
                    involved and therefore protection of the victim has to be part of our approach
                    to this; that was a challenge sometimes, and I think it became an ongoing
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>Even as we looked into, at the end of the Clinton administration and at the
                    beginning of the Bush administration, when Secretary Powell came in, there was
                    some interest by the outgoing Undersecretary for Global Affairs under Madeleine
                    Albright in moving trafficking into the Drugs and Thugs Bureau, into INL
                    (International Narcotics and Law Enforcement). I thought that would be a
                    terrible move because I thought that we would lose all the focus and attention
                    on the prevention and the protection of victims components. I thought it would
                    become purely looked at, or predominantly looked at, from the issue of organized
                    crime, and that became ? [laughter] you had another issue to advocate on and to
                    do some work on, and I think we did prevail in the end. I remember talking to
                    Richard (Dick) Armitage. When the new team came in, I was asked to come in and
                    sort of share with him my views on how this should be handled. I was
                    appreciative that they had asked me after I had left government to come in and
                    share with them some thoughts about that. It turned out that they did keep this
                    trafficking under the Undersecretary for Global Affairs; they didn't move it
                    into Drugs and Thugs.</p>
                <p>The new law, of course, required an office to be set up. I think it is important
                    that, as an office, it's separate, and that it's treated differently than drug
                    trafficking, because it is! It involves a human being. You have to look at that
                    human being from the very beginning: why is this person being lured into
                    trafficking, what are the economic or societal conditions that makes this human
                    being - a boy, a girl, or a woman - vulnerable to being lured into trafficking,
                    or sold into trafficking, or forced into these conditions of slavery. I think
                    that's a very big distinction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the big factors was the Soviet Union had
                        broken up, and living was very hard in the former Soviet Union, and certain
                        criminal elements had taken over all sorts of sectors of that economy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I think you're right. There's the combination of the rapid increase in
                    criminal activity, the open borders, the economic vulnerability and breakdown of
                    economic opportunities for a lot of people across the former Soviet Union, and
                    Ukraine, and Russia, and other countries as well, that all played together to
                    make people vulnerable to the traffickers who were and still are offering them
                    jobs out of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>I mean, we had a group in here at Vital Voices (a group of advocates, NGO
                    activists, journalists, government officials) working together on trafficking,
                    and from the far east of Russia to St. Petersburg they all pretty much said the
                    same thing - that the traffickers prey on people's economic weaknesses. You
                    know, a young woman who's just finished college and should have the world opened
                    to her doesn't have a lot of economic opportunity, a lot of great jobs. So she's
                    willing to go and look at what's being offered in Turkey, or a promise for some
                    job in the United States, or some place in Western Europe. The big challenge,
                    for these groups, is to make people aware of the risks that they're taking and
                    to set up some kind of safe travel network, so that people don't go off on their
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we setting up, I won't call them safe houses, but
                        almost transition houses - places where, particularly women (there were
                        young men involved too), where they could come to put them through a
                        process. Once they had the stigma on them and all, it's a little hard to get
                        back into regular society. I mean reintegration is being kicked back to the
                        country they went to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, reintegration is a very big challenge, and I think it's an area that
                    needs a great deal of work and thought. One of the women we work with in
                    Ukraine, Oksana Horbunova, has been doing very good work on trafficking for a
                    very long time. We met her first while we were working in the State Department
                    and met her again at one of the Vial Voices conferences we put together to
                    encourage this cadre of women's leadership, but wasn't focused on trafficking in
                    particular. Oksana has been focusing a lot on working cooperatively with her
                    government in Ukraine, which I think is very important. She deserves a lot of
                    credit for doing that. She's also been looking at when victims return: how can
                    they come back into society when they've been through some pretty horrible
                    situations, sexual slavery in many cases; how can you come back in without the
                    traffickers knowing where you're living; how can you protect your family; and
                    those are big, big challenges. I know there are a lot of different programs
                    being tried and developed, but I don't know if they have found the solution to
                    that. In some cases people return with real serious health consequences and
                    terrible health conditions. So that's also very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the reaction, while you were still in
                        government, of our embassies? You mentioned the Ukraine, where there's
                        stories of how many Ukrainian young women were flooding Western Europe and
                        are caught up in this prostitution, but I mean there are other places too.
                        Did our embassies see this as an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>LOAR: I think the end response of our embassies was very encouraging and says a
                    lot about the Foreign Service. It is that people go out as I did, (you go out to
                    the field, you're whatever level you're going out with, even if it's your second
                    or third or fourth tour), and when there's an issue that allows you to do
                    something that hasn't been done before and allows you to engage the governments
                    or the NGO sector you do it. Some people really love working with the NGO
                    sectors; and some officers look at it and say, “Well, that's not what I joined
                    for;” and then you have the public diplomacy people who were always very close
                    to what's going on in the media and what's going on in the culture and the
                    press.</p>
                <p>The response we got from our embassies on this issue was terrific, and I think
                    there's so much more potential for the U.S. being a partner in these efforts to
                    combat human trafficking through our embassies. It's great to have the Secretary
                    of State say important things here, and it's good to have things going on here
                    in Washington, but I think our embassies in the field have a great ability, to
                    partner with people on the ground, either governments, somebody in the
                    government. In most any country you will find someone - whether
                    parliamentarians, men or women, or somebody in the Labor Department (and I can
                    think of this from country to country), or somebody in the social welfare area,
                    or those who fight the organized criminal network - there's always a partner you
                    can find in almost any government in the world. Then there's somebody on the
                    ground who's looking at it from the point of view of the victims, and trying to
                    warn people off from going into these risky behaviors, or convincing the
                    families that their children shouldn't be sent. And then there are those who
                    tried to look for the alternatives, to try to provide economic alternatives and
                    looked at it from the human rights issue. But our embassies - I can just think
                    of the very creative things that officers did in trying to get this on the
                    government agenda.</p>
                <p>We had a very good team on the Italy desk here in Washington, and they activated
                    some of the folks in our embassy in Italy. We ended up with a very strong
                    relationship with the Italian government, including the head of the anti-Mafia
                    commission who came here. It wasn't like it came out of our office, and we said,
                    “We need the anti-Mafia commission.”</p>
                <p>Our office was really trying to help advise the regional bureaus on how to handle
                    this issue. That was really fun to do because you got the officers in the field
                    very engaged, and the desk officers interested in another issue, and even if you
                    looked at us and said, “Oh, that's women's rights. I'm not interested,” or you
                    had looked at it and said, “Well, you know, I don't really deal with criminal
                    issues. That's not my?” But, there were consular issues and there was a big role
                    for consular officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh really?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>LOAR: Mary Ryan, the former Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, whom I have
                    great admiration for, made a point every time I would run into her at a meeting
                    on the Seventh Floor and in the cafeteria, of saying, “Are we doing enough on
                    trafficking?” In fact, Consular Affairs set up the whole fraud profile of
                    traffickers because consular officers had a huge role to play in issuing visas.
                    In how those visas were issued, they can detect (and they did very often)
                    trafficking rings, and people who just didn't sound very logical or accurate
                    about what they were going to the United States to do. Also, Consular Affairs
                    officers could provide information to those who received the visas (now it
                    doesn't work as the traffickers, in fact, were buying the visas wholesale or
                    working through some travel agencies) on what to expect when you come to the
                    United States. There's a lot of that that can be done. I thought that was a
                    terrific role for consular officers to play.</p>
                <p>Another role the consular officers played was in working with other embassies.
                    I'm trying to remember which countries our embassies did this in. The Ukrainian
                    ambassador, for example, had met me at a reception in the State Department, came
                    up, which I thought was extraordinary, and said, “You know, we'd really like
                    some help on this issue of trafficking,” which was very unusual - that a country
                    would admit they'd have a problem and that the ambassador would openly talk
                    about this was extraordinary - and he said, “When I was ambassador from Ukraine
                    to Israel I would see so many Ukrainian women there, and I wouldn't know what to
                    do, or how we should approach it, and,” he said, “this is really a concern for
                    us, and we want to work on it,” which opened up a lot of things: Madeleine
                    Albright's discussion with Kuchma, to a model program in Ukraine, to cooperation
                    on the law enforcement side; which was just very, very good.</p>
                <p>But one of the things our embassies did, based on that conversation and based on
                    concerns that we had heard from a number of other governments, was some of the
                    former Soviet Union countries and other countries didn't really have a system
                    for protecting their citizens when they were in other countries. They had these
                    embassies, but the embassies were set up to deal with government to government
                    issues, and not to look after their own citizens. The Philippine government is
                    extraordinarily concerned about the welfare of their citizens in other
                    countries, and they actually have a government agency that deals with this
                    because so many Filipinos go overseas to work.</p>
                <p>But most other governments did not have that. So one of the things some of our
                    consular officers did was to work within the Consular Corps to sort of share
                    information on how you protect your citizens when they're overseas, and if they
                    find themselves in this situation and they come in and ask for your help, how
                    you can repatriate them safely. I thought that was just a terrific response. It
                    wasn't a huge resource issue. It was sharing expertise and ideas on how we do
                    this, and there were some very good models that came out of that. I know that
                    there were Foreign Service officers nominated for awards for their work on
                    trafficking in the field, and I thought that was just terrific because I thought
                    it wasn't, you know, somebody who called following a mandate, but were really
                    using their skills and talents and contacts to make a difference on this
                    emerging issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a very short time you were there and responding
                        to something, and the State Department normally takes a long, long time to
                        take a look at the environment, or this sort of thing. But of course, this
                        thing almost exploded with the demise of the Soviet Union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had been going on, but not in the numbers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. And I think too, the fact that there was such human suffering
                    involved, that it really drove people to want to see what could be done. People
                    were probably also encouraged by something else we did. I knew how the State
                    Department worked. So, when we got a cable in from the field which reported on
                    any activity done or some new idea, we would send a kudos cable back. We did
                    this an awful lot. We would write cables back to say, Washington greatly
                    appreciates that reporting. We did this because I knew that that language was
                    used in someone's EER (Employee Evaluation Report), their personnel evaluation,
                    and that motivates people to want to do more. They also learnt that there are
                    NGOs in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it also alerts the ambassador or the consul general
                        to their embassy personnel's being appreciated in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: For that insightful thing about the opposition party [laughter], and those
                    cables are their standard reporting, and you wanted to encourage that kind of
                    reporting when that came in and the truth is that we were getting such
                    incredible information from the field. It was very, very helpful to us, and we
                    were able to leverage it with local embassies here, through our contacts in the
                    UN, and through a whole range of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your connection to the news media? Did you have
                        contacts at the New York Times or the Washington Post, or the AP (Associated
                        Press)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I don't know if I had mentioned it earlier, but one of the ways this
                    issue really came to my attention was through a reporter named Victoria Pope,
                    who was with U.S. News &amp; World Report, and who had just come back from
                    Russia, and was doing an investigative piece on something she had seen there and
                    seen here in the United States, on Russian women being brought into the United
                    States and end up in trafficking. That really woke me up to the issue,
                    particularly when she mentioned that the women were being trafficked into New
                    Jersey. I had graduated from Rutgers in New Brunswick. That was my hometown
                    area, and I was very concerned about that. She said what would happen is that
                    once these women and girls were picked up by the INS (Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service), the traffickers would know when they were being
                    deported and would pick them up on the other end and send them somewhere else.
                    That was very distressing, but very helpful to have the press put their
                    attention on.</p>
                <p>I do remember that there was attention and interest from Times and Post reporters
                    in the field on this issue. There was interest on trafficking from the press
                    based in Washington when there was talk about putting a law together, because it
                    had such broad bipartisan support from both Republicans and Democrats, from
                    religious groups, from feminist groups, and from people working across all
                    sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you able to pinpoint any countries,
                        particularly the Middle East or somewhere else, where there was a blind eye
                        turned, if you get some European women into the brothels?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been a story that's been around for hundreds of
                        years. But I was wondering what -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, I think there were a number of governments that were making quite a
                    bit of money off of the whole operation and were not eager to take action and
                    didn't like any particular attention put on the issue. I think that it wasn't
                    isolated to one part of the world. It wasn't just women, as we're finding out
                    more and more now. It's boys being put on coffee plantations; they were just
                    kidnaped in the way that people have experienced and known slavery and slaves
                    were brought to the United States. These young children are being sold to work
                    on farms and sweat shops. So it's pretty broad and pretty much across the
                    board.</p>
                <p>You know, if we can point to a model country that puts a law on the books and
                    implements it, it really does something to work with the members of civil
                    society who are trying to fight it, and that's a big step forward. But I really
                    can't point to a model country. I don't think we're a model country. I think we
                    still have a lot to do to really come to terms with people who end up in those
                    conditions here in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Just the other day I had a meeting with one of the service providers, who is just
                    utterly, completely frustrated because the trafficked victims who come to them
                    primarily are those who are sold into domestic servitude. So they're in homes as
                    virtual prisoners, but somehow they are able to connect with other people in
                    their own ethnic community and to find help, and this is in Los Angeles. If 90
                    percent of their cases are on domestic servitude, well, all the stories we're
                    hearing in the press, and all the things that we hear about are the sexual
                    slavery and brothels, where are they? And it's of great concern because it's so
                    underground, so hidden, and so invisible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the State Department when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: At the end of the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you moved. What did you do? We want to talk
                        about Vital Voices and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is Vital Voices, and how did you get involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. I don't remember if I talked about how we started Vital Voices
                    Democracy Initiative in the government. I guess I didn't because I mentioned
                    that at the end of our last session. One of the things we were trying to look at
                    was trying to identify how to support women's role in public life. One of the
                    things I kept hearing in my meetings with women, with women's human rights
                    groups here in the United States, and from women whom I met with on my travels
                    internationally through UN meetings, was how difficult it was for them to have a
                    role in the public life in their country, and how difficult it was to be at the
                    seat of power and to influence what their governments were doing, or if they
                    were in government, to have any access to real decision makers or to make
                    change.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>Swanee Hunt, who was our ambassador to Vienna, had spent a good deal of time
                    traveling around Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and had met with a
                    lot of different women's groups. She was also very engaged in peace building
                    efforts. She decided to hold a conference, and she called it “Vital Voices:
                    Women in Democracy,” in July of '97, just before she left post, to pull together
                    some of the women she had worked with in her tenure as U.S. ambassador to
                    Austria. She did a very exciting, energetic job of pulling people together and
                    putting on this big-time conference of these 300 people in Vienna, Austria. She
                    was putting together a steering committee, and she asked me, as the Senior
                    Coordinator of International Women's Issues, and in the foreign policy part of
                    my job, to serve on this steering committee and to engage the State Department.
                    She also contacted the First Lady's office and asked Mrs. Clinton to come to
                    this and speak. So the NSC got involved, because if Mrs. Clinton was going to
                    speak at a conference on democracy, it was important that the foreign policy
                    elements be right in line. That was actually a very important first step. I give
                    Swanee a lot of credit for taking the initiative, and pulling this together with
                    the idea of getting women together from all the different sectors of society,
                    who could work with each other to strengthen each other's capacity, and to link
                    them to some American women who might be able to work with them on an ongoing
                    basis.</p>
                <p>It was a struggle to get the State Department to see this conference as something
                    more than a gathering to support women. It was a big deal to get a cable out to
                    say that promoting women's roles and building democracy is one of the elements
                    of U.S. foreign policy. I remember it was Jim O'Brien [James O'Brien] in
                    Secretary Albright's office who was my ally and allowed me to get clearance to
                    get the cable out, because it wasn't enthusiastically received. It was seen as
                    an ambassador, and a political appointee ambassador to boot, who was leaving
                    post and wanted to pull some women together for a conference. It wasn't well
                    received despite all of Swanee's good efforts. And, Swanee's a very colorful,
                    lively person, so it wasn't like she was particularly concerned about how they
                    saw it. When Swanee had asked me to become involved, I wanted to have the
                    foreign policy components to it; so that was a big effort to do that.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>Swanee had had some groups she had worked with, but we asked our embassies to
                    identify the women candidates who could be invited to this conference, and let
                    the ambassadors themselves do the inviting. So it was a really sort of trying to
                    route it into the embassies then. There were some posts that didn't think there
                    were particularly any emerging women leaders who could benefit from coming to a
                    conference then [laughter], and our response would be, “Well, that would be
                    extraordinary that there would be no emerging women leaders in your one country
                    when there are in the rest of the world.” But, that was an initial reluctance.
                    Some of the embassies sent officers, actually, to the conference to accompany
                    the group that they had identified. That was the best model. The women met with
                    the ambassadors before they went and then met with the ambassadors when they
                    came home. So, then the embassy had a whole other set of contacts, with women,
                    who felt terrific about the United States, and felt that the U.S. cared about
                    the things they were working on, which was Rule of Law and human rights issues
                    and clean government, and that the U.S. recognized that as women they had a
                    particular path to travel on this, and that they would be brought into the way
                    the embassies worked - so that was the model. Swanee left government shortly
                    after that. We recognized that model as a very good way to try to build regional
                    capacity, and to help our embassies expand their contacts with women, and to
                    find a way to look at promoting women's role in building democracies. We also
                    recognized that the U.S. could use these conferences as a way to accelerate U.S.
                    government interaction with emerging women leaders and to help them find
                    resources for follow-up.</p>
                <p>You know, after the Vienna conference, the U.S. gave a lot of money to the former
                    Soviet Union, so we had a huge AID budget. Richard Morningstar was the
                    coordinator for all U.S. assistance to the former Soviet Union; he was a great
                    ally and he was very interested in working with us. He pulled together all the
                    different partners in the U.S. government who funded programs in the former
                    Soviet Union and agreed to take a look at how their programs were benefiting
                    women, at whether we were giving women a fair share of the assistance money in
                    any program such as those for democracy or those supporting entrepreneurship,
                    and at whether we were including them enough in the design of the programs. That
                    was a huge, huge undertaking; and it was really a direct look after we came out
                    of this wonderful first conference, and the many strategies and ideas that
                    needed to be developed, at where do you go from here? Resources are a big part
                    of it, and the U.S. encouraging it through a lot of different ways is another
                    thing. But since we're throwing so much money into the former Soviet Union, why
                    couldn't some of this money be directed towards some of these strategies, which
                    these women were very clear on how to move forward; these were also things that
                    we as a government said were important to us. So Richard Morningstar, Dick
                    Morningstar, was very helpful in pulling that process together. For me it was
                    fun because it was not just a conference and all the great feelings you have at
                    a conference, but doing the follow-through afterwards and being able to deliver
                    something on a more permanent basis.</p>
                <p>The next Vital Voices conference that we held, Swanee had -</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been a Vital Voices organization before? Or,
                        this created Vital Voices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: The first was a conference that Swanee conceived of, organized, and called
                    the “Vital Voices: Women in Democracy” conference. We started calling it
                    “Initiative” when we decided, “Okay, well, we're going to?”</p>
                <p>Swanee left government; she went up to Harvard to set up a wonderful program that
                    focuses on women in armed conflict and women in peace building. “Women Waging
                    Peace.” We had a very strong collaboration with her because this is all on a
                    continuum: we focused on women's political, economic, and human rights issues,
                    and what Swanee focuses on at Women Waging Peace is women in peace building and
                    then ending armed conflicts.</p>
                <p>So when Swanee left government, we wanted to continue this model of bringing
                    emerging women leaders and engaging our embassies, around the overlay of women
                    in democracy, because I thought that was a very important way of presenting
                    these issues to the State Department, to the general public and to other
                    governments. Nobody could say they were really against democracy. So as I was
                    saying, it was packaging the idea of women's human rights under the democracy
                    umbrella, which is a very legitimate thing to do because democracy should be a
                    delivery system for human rights and for women's human rights. It allowed us to
                    move forward and engage broad sectors in this conference. It went from
                    conference to initiative.</p>
                <p>The second conference we did wasn't planned that this was the way we were going
                    to do it, but the opportunity came up. It was after the Good Friday Peace
                    Agreements in Northern Ireland in 199a process we were part of. They had worked
                    for a long time. Some of these women were trade union leaders, like Inez
                    McCormack; and others, like Avila Kilmurray, were community leaders; and they
                    were part of the process of the Good Friday Peace Accords. Some of them were in
                    the meeting rooms and part of the long, long, long negotiations.</p>
                <p>But they were very concerned that after the Good Friday Peace Accords were agreed
                    on, they would be pushed aside, and would not have a role in being able to build
                    the new assembly or build the new economic structures across the community and
                    across the border structures that would come out of that. So they had a series
                    of meetings. Some of the women, Monica McWilliams, Pearl Sagar, and others, were
                    here in meetings at the White House for St. Patrick's Day. President Clinton
                    always brought a large group of people from Northern Ireland to the White House
                    for St. Patrick's Day. They were very big and very fun receptions, with tents -
                    big, bigger every year but always very encouraging for people in Northern
                    Ireland who were working on these issues, because they felt they had great
                    partners who wanted to really move them towards a sustainable peace. Then these
                    women came, and had a series of conversations with President and with Mrs.
                    Clinton.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>When the women from Northern Ireland came to one of the St. Patrick's Day
                    receptions at the White House, right after the Good Friday Peace agreements in
                    1998, they said they were very concerned that when the new government structures
                    and new economic structures were to be developed, that they would be pushed
                    aside, and they needed some help in finding their voice and in articulating
                    their message. The word “voices” kept coming up, and out of that came, through
                    the mysteries of how our country works [laughter]?an agreement, and when
                    President Clinton announced our U.S. commitments to the peace accords, there was
                    a line that said, “?and the U.S. government has agreed to host a Vital Voices
                    conference in Northern Ireland to help women integrate themselves into the new
                    structures;” and hence, we were going to hold a Vital Voices conference. And I'm
                    not sure all the players involved in that from the NSC side quite understood how
                    that happened, how this little Vital Voices piece got in there [laughter], but
                    it happened, and it was all for good!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was one of the big things in Washington: the
                        scramble to get a line in a presidential address, or presidential decree, or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, it was good to have the First Lady's team who were very adept
                    and very committed there, and to have the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, willing
                    to help out in any way and willing to respond to our needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But Vital Voices in Northern Ireland was a tremendous challenge because it
                    was tied to the travel of Hillary Clinton and President Clinton. That was a very
                    complicated time, when there were all kinds of scandals going on, and lots of
                    questions about who was traveling when, and what people were going to do, and
                    whether they were going to come to Northern Ireland. But there was not real
                    interest on the part of a number of people in our government in having a
                    conference focused on women, and in having Hillary Clinton be the main feature
                    of the conference at the same time, and to have it timed with the President's
                    trip. The exact words were, “that this will get in the way of President
                    Clinton's trip, therefore this will not happen.” This was people out of our
                    embassy in London, people in the European Bureau, people in the National
                    Security Council.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>I kept referring to the fact that this was a commitment that was made by a
                    president of the United States. We had great interest on the part of the British
                    Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam [Marjorie Mowlam], who was a
                    fantastically interesting person, a leader in the peace negotiations, and a
                    tremendously important and fun person, because she never took herself too
                    seriously. In the history of Northern Ireland and the peace accords, she
                    emerged, and will continue to emerge, as a very important player. She thought it
                    was important to encourage the women in Northern Ireland to play a role. She
                    thought that a visit from Hillary Clinton and a conference that engaged
                    different players in the American public from the business side and from those
                    engaged in organizing, advocacy, public speaking, and business development was
                    extremely important for women in Northern Ireland at this time. She thought that
                    the new leaders of the government, Seamus Mallon and David Trimble, could be
                    brought around to see this as something that would be helpful to what they were
                    trying to do with the new Northern Ireland government. So from the Northern
                    Ireland side, we had the government enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>The obstacles were some of the fellows on our side, who would not give any
                    country clearance to go to Northern Ireland to visit, and it was just
                    extraordinarily ridiculous and difficult, and to this day we'll not understand
                    whom they thought they were working for. But this resistance fell apart at some
                    point, and the way was cleared.</p>
                <p>There was a memorable meeting in the White House when Mo Mowlam came to visit
                    once. She had some very good meetings with Secretary Albright, and with the
                    President and his people. She had a conversation with Hillary Clinton as well,
                    and said, “I thought you guys were going to come over and do this meeting to
                    help energize our women in Northern Ireland.” There was a fellow there from the
                    National Security Council who had been less than enthusiastic about this whole
                    process, and he relayed to Mo Mowlam that, “Oh, no, we can't do that, because
                    there's no hotel rooms available because it's around the time of the President's
                    visit, and we might be able to use Queen's University, which is fine, but it's
                    not like the premier spot for a conference.” There was a brand new, fabulous
                    conference facility called the Waterfront; Bono from U2 had just done a huge
                    concert there, and it was a fabulous place, and that's what we had our eye on.
                    We were also told it was not available because it would only be available for
                    the President. And Mowlam said, “Well, I don't think so. No, I think it's
                    available!” in other words, “This is my place, Northern Ireland; I think I can
                    make that available.” And he said, “Well, I don't know if there's any hotels
                    either.” And she said, “Oh, no! There are! There are hotels!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>LOAR: And that kind of resistance all fell away. The overt, open opposition fell
                    away, and I was in this meeting, and Mo said, “Well, Theresa, you're coming
                    over, right? You're going to come over. Well, can you come over next week? And
                    can we just start planning this, because I'll pull the women leaders from
                    Northern Ireland together if I know you're going to come over. Don't let me down
                    now!” So I had my marching orders and was on the flight over, and then they had
                    to give me a country clearance to be able to come into Northern Ireland. Our DCM
                    in London, you know, I trying?I'm blanking on his name, because you blank out
                    all the names [Robert Bradtke]! You only remember the people who helped you!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And we had a great consul general in Northern Ireland at that time. It was
                    Kathy Stephens [Kathleen Stephens]; she was leaving post. So if she had stayed,
                    that would have been a lot easier to try to get this all done.</p>
                <p>But at any rate, it was a tremendous, tremendous success in that we did a
                    tremendous amount of work. Dave Pozorski, who's a great Foreign Service officer,
                    and who was part of George Mitchell's negotiating team, knew everybody in
                    Northern Ireland, of course. I was not an expert in Northern Ireland. We didn't
                    have the cooperation of the European Bureau, the embassy in London, Bob Bradtke,
                    I guess, the DCM, was just not on board with the program, and we had no consul
                    general in Belfast. So it was very important that we be able to engage people
                    and present ourselves as part of the U.S. government in appropriate ways. So
                    Dave Pozorski was terrific because he came back to help out and sort of
                    introduced us to all the key players. By having him introduce us, because he was
                    part of Senator Mitchell's negotiating team, it was like having the mayor
                    everywhere we went. Literally, you could not walk down the street in Belfast
                    without somebody knowing Dave. So we just spent a lot of time ahead of time to
                    get this right, because in Northern Ireland it's like the Middle East, if you
                    invite one person and not the other, you invite this political party and not the
                    other; a person who spells her name Moira this name and Mora that name,
                    indicates which community you're from, or which religious traditioit was very
                    important to get it right. So it was very, very important that we get the mix of
                    individuals and political parties and economic entities right. So we spent a lot
                    of time sort of traveling around Northern Ireland engaging people from all the
                    different counties, which was a beautiful thing to do. The roads were horrible,
                    but the scenery was beautiful. It was a fun, terrific experience. As someone
                    with an Irish heritage, I just loved it. But it was exhausting because there
                    were so many different communities, and sectors, and individuals, and political
                    parties who really needed to be consulted and brought into this; and we worked
                    very, very hard to do that, all with the blessing of Mo Mowlam.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>As she had requested, I did go over there to visit her the following week. Her
                    office was in Hillsborough, which is this absolutely beautiful castle where the
                    Queen of England comes to stay when she visits Northern Ireland. Mo invited us
                    to come there for a chat, and I thought, “Here I am, [laughter], Theresa Loar,
                    in Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland planning a women's conference with
                    this fantastic woman, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam. How
                    did this happen? This is quite a moment!” It was just terrific. But, of course,
                    there was no time to think about that because we walked in the door, and Mo
                    said, “Okay, I got the groups here; I have the political leaders here; we're
                    going to start work,” and we did.</p>
                <p>The embassy in London did send someone to help out, AKA (also known as) keep
                    their eye on, also - not AKA, but also keep their eye on us, and of course, I
                    warmly welcomed their participation and their help because I believed in doing
                    things by the book in the State Department, and they just had to recognize the
                    book was changing [laughter], and they thought I had to kind of get with the
                    program. But it was a very, very good way to get started once we broke through.
                    You know, if it wasn't for Mo Mowlam's engagement -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about Northern Ireland, the Catholicism, and
                        all that, abortion is such a divisive issue within the United States. I can
                        see where that, well, could not help but be a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, Northern Ireland has a majority Protestant community with a minority
                    Catholic population. I think in Ireland it's a very different situation, where
                    the Catholic Church is very influential on the issue of reproductive health and
                    abortion. But we actually looked at the issues of women's reproductive health
                    and abortion, and I did not take on those issues as part of the mandate of my
                    job, as I was able to determine that there was already a way, a structure in our
                    government, to look at issues of reproductive health and abortion rights and
                    maternal health and all those issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And I did not put those under the mandate or the agenda of what I was going
                    to work on, because I thought it would be completely divisive, we'd never get it
                    done, and it would not be a thing that would motivate me to get up and to try to
                    develop into foreign policy. I thought that promoting women's roles in building
                    democracy, giving women access to their government to be able to be part of
                    shaping the government, I wasn't controversial; I think we could get more people
                    on board with that. So we never, never in these conferences took on that issue,
                    and I was criticized severely by both sides for not doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems you did the right thing, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>LOAR: I mean I think strategically it was the right thing to do; and I think we
                    would not have made any of the progress on bringing people along on this agenda
                    if we had included that as well. First of all, there wasn't a strong structure
                    in our government, in many different places in our government, for dealing with
                    that and for working on that issue. I was trying to look at the underdeveloped
                    issues: violence against women; trafficking; women playing a role in moving
                    towards democracy, and getting women to be part of that; and the women who
                    really wanted U.S. partnership and wanted the U.S. to help them find their voice
                    in their own country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the conference took place when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: In 1998, in the beginning of September 1998. This is when we called it an
                    ongoing Global Initiative, even though it was our second conference [laughter].
                    We already were getting some work in Latin America: they wanted to have some
                    regional convening for women, and we had heard from others elsewhere who wanted
                    to do the same kind of thing. But we also knew that, unlike the former Soviet
                    Union, we didn't have a lot of resources and follow-up money to work with to
                    implement some of the ideas and strategies. So we started thinking about
                    bringing in private sector Americans who would come to this conference with
                    ideas for implementation and follow-through, as well as resources, whether it
                    was offered in internships or political skills training that they could
                    provide.</p>
                <p>It was actually Alyse Nelson, who was working with me at the State Department,
                    who kind of came up with this idea to say when Americans come to this
                    conference, it would be a very hot ticket. Americans would want to come over to
                    Northern Ireland; there was a very active and engaged Irish-American community.
                    The fact that Hillary Clinton was going to be there, people now saw as something
                    very interesting and important. And, too, if Americans wanted to engage because
                    of Alyse Nelson's idea, which was wonderful, they would bring a commitment for
                    follow-through. That really did set up this beginning of the idea that there
                    were outside partners out of government who could help be part of this
                    initiative. It wasn't that we were soliciting because we weren't able to do
                    that, of course.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>But if someone wanted to send a representative - for example, the Marriott was
                    very interested in setting up a series of hotels in Northern Ireland once the
                    violence stopped, but there weren't a lot of people who were trained to be able
                    to work in the hospitality industry - they made a commitment to train a certain
                    number of women to work in the field as managers; so that was wonderful. Another
                    group - this was Shrum, Devine and Donilon, through one of the wives of one of
                    the partners there, Marylouise Oates - committed to doing a political advocacy
                    and communications training for a group of women community leaders and those in
                    the political life in Northern Ireland, a really top-notch training. There was a
                    whole series of commitments like that, and we realized there was real interest
                    then in not just having people in government follow through. As more
                    representatives from different private sectors committed themselves - Discovery
                    Communications sent some of their executives, and said that they would want to
                    do some good work and follow-through - that became the beginning of the idea of
                    how to engage this on a longer term basis and invade the private sector.</p>
                <p>So we started thinking ahead about how to engage people so that it doesn't just
                    become just the government engaging as follow-up partners. I'll sort of end for
                    today, but kind of go on to how we continued it in government until the end of
                    the administration, and then how the nonprofit got started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. So we'll pick this up really towards the end of
                        how the commitment to Vital Voices worked when you left at the end of the
                        Clinton administration, and then what you've done since then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 5 August 2003. Theresa, you want to pick up
                        where we're starting on this. You came to Vital Voices after you left the
                        Clinton administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>LOAR: Well, we had been looking at how to respond to the needs of this network of
                    women all over the world who we had been working with; some going back to before
                    the Beijing Conference, and some through the beginning of the first Vital Voices
                    Conference in 1997. Here it was the end of 2000; and these women were people we
                    had worked very closely with, who had done great work in Russia on violence
                    against women and trafficking, in Northern Ireland on women's political
                    leadership, and in Latin America on trafficking and fighting corruption. We
                    recognized that these women continued to want to work together and to work with
                    us. As we started looking at setting up this nonprofit, we really wanted to look
                    at what was most needed.</p>
                <p>So we had a global advisory council meeting. We picked 10 to 15 of the women we
                    had worked with over the years who were the most dynamic and had the most impact
                    on what was going on in their country. We invited them to Washington for an
                    off-site retreat where the Stanley Foundation (Joan Winship was the officer
                    there) hosted us at Airlie House. It is always nice to get out of town a little
                    bit. It was a moderated retreat with a series of discussions entitled: “Where do
                    we go from here?” and “What is most needed?” What these women said in one
                    conversation after another was that, “We need training. We need more women like
                    us in our country.”</p>
                <p>The woman from Russia, Marina Pisklakova-Parker now, said, “If there were 10 of
                    me in my country, wouldn't it be great? “We'd have someone who knew how to talk
                    to the press, and we'd have the kinds of trainings and experience that I got
                    through my relationship with Vital Voices, and through working with people at
                    the State Department, as they have been developing this since 1997.” I remember
                    the first meeting with Marina; she was terrific. But, she's so much more
                    effective now! And she said, “Imagine if there were 10 more like me, who knew
                    how to talk to the press and build coalitions and make their case, and who
                    developed the confidence and skills to really unleash their potential and to
                    have great impact.” We heard that from her; and we heard that from women in
                    Vietnam who were really trying to make their way in this country where the old
                    general still thought, “Isn't it great we won the war,” and where these women
                    just want the government to get out of the way so they can build a really ...
                    Their focus was on the economic structures and on trying to move ahead, because,
                    as you may know, the Vietnamese are incredibly natural entrepreneurs. How
                    communism ever took hold of that country, I will never know! [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, I served in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there one had the impression that behind every
                        successful Vietnamese merchant was the real power, which was his wife or
                        mother. I mean the women often were the economic spark plugs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, yes. They were focused, and they were driven. We kept hearing this
                    from these women. What came out of that offsite retreat was to try to figure out
                    a way to have this new organization, Vital Voices, become a place where women
                    could receive leadership and skills training. That was just a very clear
                    message.</p>
                <p>After several discussions, we built a relationship with Georgetown University
                    with the idea of putting together a global women's leadership institute. Our
                    board chairman, Melanne Verveer, who was Hillary Clinton's, first deputy chief
                    of staff, and then, chief of staff, is a graduate of Georgetown and had a long
                    relationship with Georgetown. It was her relationships that really helped us
                    forge this alliance for Vital Voices. The Global Leadership Institute is housed
                    in the school public policy [Georgetown Public Policy Institute] at Georgetown,
                    which is wonderful. Judy Feder's [Judith Feder] the dean there. This institute
                    includes the School of Foreign Service, the law school, and the business school.
                    It allows us to draw from the richness of what Georgetown has to offer: great
                    professors, and a vibrant student body. We hold some of our sessions on campus;
                    we have public events on the campus. It's a way to bring these emerging young
                    leaders to the campus so that the students can have access to them, and a way
                    for the women to be able to have a public forum, and a way for us to be able to
                    draw from the richness of the Georgetown faculty.</p>
                <p>So this Global Leadership Institute was an idea. It didn't spark like this, but
                    we kept hearing about something like it. After discussions with Georgetown, we
                    started looking at: well, what does that mean: do you bring people to
                    Washington, or do you do trainings in the field? We started by setting up series
                    of trainings in Washington. Of course, the big challenge was how to fund that.
                    Then we started looking at whom we had worked with over the last several years.
                    It was our embassies in the field. We then started talking to our embassies to
                    say we have this relationship with Georgetown for this leadership institute for
                    women. It's been a terrific relationship with the embassies.</p>
                <p>It's one of the things I miss from the State Department - being in touch with our
                    embassies in the field and hearing a lot of stuff. But, of course, now we have
                    the Internet, and I have to say probably I hear from somebody in the field every
                    couple of days because we send out e-newsletters on issues of trafficking as a
                    part of global updates. It is wonderful to hear from the people in the
                    field.</p>
                <p>At the beginning I was certainly going through withdrawal of not having the same
                    ability to work with our colleagues in the field and to hear what's most needed
                    from them. Through this Global Leadership Institute, we had a concrete way to
                    provide much-needed skills training to women who are identified by their
                    embassies, and by our other partners as well, who are our NGO partners as women
                    who really are poised to make a big difference in their country, who have broken
                    through, and who have demonstrated some leadership.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>And so the first few trainings we did were with Vietnamese and Chinese women on
                    entrepreneurship, because in both of those countries the embassies asked us to
                    work with women there. If you looked at the range of the curriculum, leadership
                    was the overall area that we were going to focus on. The other areas were areas
                    that we had been consistently working on: violence against women and human
                    trafficking, was the most urgent call from many women in the field. The second
                    was entrepreneurship and women's economic leadership; and then the third was
                    political leadership in civil society. So in China and Vietnam we weren't going
                    to get anywhere with political participation. The embassies didn't feel that
                    there was enough of it for them to go up there to work on, so we worked on
                    entrepreneurship; so these were our first trainings at the Georgetown Leadership
                    Institute. It was just fabulous because from there we went to one country after
                    another. We've done these pretty regularly now, just about one every month or
                    every other month since we've opened the doors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now do you bring them here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, that's one part of the program - to bring them here to Georgetown. We
                    actually do some trainings right here in this building on Connecticut and L
                    Street. We have a training room as part of our office facilities here, which is
                    wonderful, because the women can go down to the stores right in this building.
                    [laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes [laughter].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They all want to go to Victoria's Secret and to Filene's Basement, and
                    often a session is getting ready to start, and the women aren't at the table.
                    Then someone will say, “She's at the basement.” [laughter]Q: [Laughter] Yes.</p>
                <p>LOAR: So we try to be disciplined, but a lot of the women who come here are dying
                    to get out and see the street life in Washington such as it is. I mean it's not
                    New York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not New York City, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And then, of course, they wanted to see what Washingtonians are like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>LOAR: Last summer, just to give you an idea, we had a group of women legislators
                    and human rights leaders and journalists from all over Latin America come for
                    training. This training was a real cost sharing opportunity. [laughter] We don't
                    do anything easy, like, here's a grant and everything's covered, because we're
                    still starting up, and we're still demonstrating what we're able to offer, and
                    what the value is to the women around the world. This was the Liz Claiborne
                    Foundation, which funded women from four countries where they have operations in
                    the field, because they're very interested in a nice stable country; and they're
                    very forward-looking. Liz Claiborne is very -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Liz Claiborne does what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Women's clothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Women's clothing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But they're a huge, very progressive company. They were known for their
                    good labor practices as well in the Clinton administration. We have the Arca
                    Foundation, which is associated with Elizabeth Bagley, who's on our board of
                    directors; they care a lot about Latin America. Three or four embassies have
                    funded women to attend as well. So, we have had a whole smorgasbord of
                    funders.</p>
                <p>What came out of that was that these women came in for a very intensive training
                    that was going to be focused on political leadership. However, corruption and
                    anti-corruption kept emerging as an issue. We had Virginia Canter, who's a
                    ethics lawyer at the Treasury Department come and have a very informal chat over
                    lunch about ethical procedures, and how American government officials, if
                    they're going to take a high-level position, have to fill out different kinds of
                    forms. And it was like we lit a match, because they were extraordinarily
                    interested in that. These women could not believe that if you're going to go
                    into government, you have to actually say what's in your bank accounts and what
                    companies your family owns, and that there would be a possibility that you
                    couldn't regulate the company your family owns. So it was a very interesting
                    thing, and we thought we would not look at corruption as a women's issue;
                    however, that emerged as a very big issue there.</p>
                <p>In all the sessions, we also had a discussion about human trafficking, and how it
                    affects what goes on in the country. All of that was under this whole overall
                    discussion about political leadership and women's leadership.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>In this training we had a woman from the Dominican Republic, Minou Tavarez, whose
                    mother, Minerva Mirabal, is known throughout the hemisphere as one of the people
                    who stood up against a military dictatorship. In the Time of the Butterflies
                    (Julia Alvarez's great book) is written about her mother and her sisters. These
                    were really dynamic women from Peru, Guatemala, Colombia, and the Dominican
                    Republic. That was a year ago.</p>
                <p>Since then, we've done follow-ups in two of those countries. We start by bringing
                    people here to Washington, because in addition to the trainings and the sessions
                    with us, there are the really top people they're able to interact with, and whom
                    we put them in front of. One of the things they say again and again, is
                    “Communications is very important, and if I can't break through in the press, or
                    through how I speak publicly on the floor of the Congress, or in how I lobby and
                    make my case then I won't make any progress.” So we have a heavy focus on
                    communications; we have a very good program for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say communications, could you explain what you
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. So part of the program is, for example, Eileen O'Connor, who used to
                    be CNN Bureau Chief and is a terrifically committed and talented person, will
                    come in and work with them and say, “Okay. What are the three key points you
                    want to make in the issues that you're working on?” And they'll go on like most
                    people, and they'll talk for five minutes. She goes, “No, no. That's 20 points.
                    Three points, and then how do you want to say those three points?” And then
                    Eileen will coach them on how to respond to the press. Let's say you were trying
                    to get the local people to write an article on something you think is important,
                    okay? How do you manage that interview? And here is a former CNN reporter, a
                    very senior, talented person coaching them on how to talk to the press, and how
                    to get the press, not to manipulate and use you, into a position where you'd be
                    able to use them as a vehicle for what you wanted to say. It's fascinating, and
                    it's just very, very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: These women recognize this is a CNN person who is very well known and has a
                    very good career; so they know they're really working with top women.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>Then the next phase of the communications training is putting women in front of
                    cameras. We split the group of women, into two. We have two public relations
                    firms who have donated their time. They do this at least once a month for us,
                    which is just amazing to me. One is The Kamber Group [TKG]; Jill Schuker is an
                    executive there who donates her services to work with a group of women. The
                    other half go to Susan Davis International [SDI]. Susan is on our board of
                    directors, and Judy Whittlesey is the executive there who puts them in front of
                    a camera and says, “Okay, let's practice those three points you're going to
                    make.” So we usually have six in each group. One, by the way, is known as the
                    Republican PR Program and one's known as the Democratic PR Program [laughter],
                    because this is Washington!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: They split up. They stand in front of their colleagues and the other women
                    in this training who they've gotten to know. We don't do this in the beginning;
                    we do this after they know each other a little bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Then they practice in front of a camera. They bring a camera crew in, and
                    they film them, and then they roll it back and critique it. And they get the
                    tape of what they looked like in front of the camera and the tape of the
                    comments. One person said, “I was going to buy this, but I wouldn't know where
                    to buy it in my country. No one does this kind of thing. It's so important for
                    me to focus and direct what I'm doing.” The women mentioned again and again, as
                    one of the most important things, that it gives them confidence seeing
                    themselves on television as the one to stand up and to make that speech in
                    either a corporate or public setting.</p>
                <p>So that's the value of a Washington-based training. You do very high-end, really
                    high-end things. Almost every group meets with our two honorary co-chairs,
                    Hillary Clinton from New York and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas. These aren't
                    long extended meetings, but they have an opportunity to say hello to these women
                    who are very big deals in our political structure and to get a photo with them.
                    It means a lot to these women from other countries. What's wonderful is both of
                    the senators are always very engaged, and the women will ask them questions even
                    though you're right in the middle of a picture. The women want to know!</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>I remember one of them asking Kay Bailey Hutchison, “How did you decide to run
                    for senator? There's only what, 11 of you, or now maybe 13? How did you decide?”
                    And Kay Bailey was just?she was just lovely. She said, “I am like you. I worked
                    at local government like you do.” These were women from all over Russia who were
                    here, “I realized this was something that I could do and make a difference, and
                    I would be good at. I just kept working my way up, and kept thinking maybe I
                    could be doing more.” She just related to them instantly. Those political skills
                    just translated across, and these women really took that to heart. It was just
                    the most lovely discussion.</p>
                <p>These groups get to meet Hillary Clinton. Many of these women know of her because
                    she visited their countries when she was First Lady, that she stood up for women
                    around the world, and that she had a real emphasis on women's rights. Of course,
                    they want to ask her, “How do you like being senator?” They want to ask her all
                    these questions right off the bat. This is something that's particular and
                    special to the Washington experience.</p>
                <p>And then we also usually have, a press opportunity, like Nora Boustany from the
                    Washington Post. Diplomatic Dispatches is always looking for great stories of
                    women overseas, and she's done two or three profiles of the women who have come
                    in. She did a whole piece on the Russian women, and she called it, “Up From the
                    Underground, Russia's Feminists Reach Out.” She gets these women to talk about
                    things that we don't hear about and we were with them for two weeks. Nora will
                    ask them these pointed questions which get right at it and the women tell about
                    all this other stuff going on in their countries.</p>
                <p>Sometimes they're on NPR (National Public Radio). Part of this is to help them
                    find their voice, and then to learn the skills and use them to affect policy
                    makers. And of course, we go over to Mother State. We bring every group that
                    comes over to the State Department. We do this for a couple of reasons. One is
                    we do want policymakers to hear these women directly. It doesn't mean that
                    they're not listening to them but it's a big deal. These women think the State
                    Department is some big deal. We'll work with several people, one of whom is Tony
                    Wayne [Earl Anthony Wayne], the Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and
                    Business Affairs, he is always available. Sometimes he hosts the lunch if
                    they're businesswomen. We had a delegation from Africa recently - this was
                    unbelievable - and these were businesswomen who were just the top-notch
                    businesswomen of the continent; really tremendously effective women. They had
                    had a series of meetings, with different people and then when they met with
                    Tony, who hosted them for lunch in the diplomatic rooms, which is quite a big
                    deal -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>LOAR: He started off his speech, by saying a couple things about Vital Voices
                    because he was one of the greatest supporters of Vital Voices. He had a
                    tremendous effect on what we were able to do with it as a government program
                    when he was in the European Bureau, before he moved to EB (Bureau of Economics
                    and Business Affairs). He started off with mentioning a little bit about Vital
                    Voices, but then went into this whole speech about Africa and the U.S.
                    government's economic interests in Africa. The women responded to that by asking
                    him questions on the business track: what's going on with the oil industry; and
                    with mining and the extraction industry. It was this fabulous, high-level
                    discussion between business people and an economic policy person at the State
                    Department. They didn't respond to other people that way because he talked to
                    them like they were economic business leaders, and policy people, and
                    businesswomen making a difference. But they responded that way, and it was very
                    interesting. He's got a real vision. It was terrific!</p>
                <p>Another one of the things that could happen, is that they get a chance to
                    interact, and policymakers get to hear. I mean he just said, “I'm really
                    particularly interested in the oil business.” And one of the women from Cameroon
                    was involved in the pipeline from someplace to someplace else (I forget, you
                    know)?from Chad, maybe through Cameroon. So he sat down with her at length and
                    said, “You know, this is information we don't necessarily hear in cables.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: This is very direct information, and people would say things very directly.
                    They wouldn't tell an officer in the embassy, and the officer wouldn't be able
                    to put it in the cable anyway. So I think it's also of value to the
                    policymakers. To be able to hear from these women directly -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ? and in the field we're making a difference. So that's all part of the
                    program that we do in Washington.</p>
                <p>But increasingly, we've been asked to do follow-up in the field, and we've
                    started doing that. And, of course, it costs money to bring people to
                    Washington. But, it's very high-level, and they get a very high-level of
                    interactions. But in the field, you're able to reach a lot more people. So for
                    example, we were asked to go down to Guatemala. Our ambassador, John Hamilton,
                    and his wife, Donna Hamilton, are two great Foreign Service people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>LOAR: And, Donna has recently retired, and they have a fantastic home in
                    Guatemala and they're there at such an important time. John was involved in the
                    peace negotiations for years. They'd be a great couple to talk to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know Donna.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, it was lovely to see them again. John was my boss when I was in
                    ARA/CEN (Bureau of Inter-American Affairs/Office of Central American Affairs) on
                    the Costa Rica and Nicaragua desks. He was a tough boss, and very, very
                    demanding. Because he was smart and hard working, he wanted everybody else to be
                    that way, and that was fine with me [laughter]. I think she liked working for
                    people like that.</p>
                <p>And so, of course, when we visited him in Guatemala as part of this training, he
                    said, “We're going to have a reception for you and for the Vital Voices
                    delegation that's here to conduct this training.” It was very nice that they did
                    that. And he said, “So I'll make a speech, and you can make a speech too. You'll
                    do it in Spanish, right?” I'm like, “Aughh! I guess I have to!” My Spanish
                    language skills were never good to start with, but I felt that I needed to, and
                    so I practiced really, really hard. My son Patrick, who's 17, came with me on
                    this trip to Guatemala. The translators who were working on our training session
                    helped me translate the speech. I practiced it in my room, and Patrick said to
                    me, “Right, Ma, I think you're going to have to stand in front of that mirror
                    and practice it four times!” And I said, “Well, I think I know what I'm doing.”
                    And he said, “No, you're stumbling, and you're stopping, and you're saying words
                    that don't sound like Spanish!” So actually I did what he suggested, and it
                    turned out quite well; and, while I was giving this speech, I looked at Patrick,
                    and he gave me the appropriate nod.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So it's wonderful to have a son who can give you good advice like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But, just to go back to that training in Guatemala. The Guatemalan women
                    who had come up here had asked us to go there and do some training for a larger
                    group. It was actually 40 women in Guatemala, including eight or ten indigenous
                    Mayan women who were in full dress and focusing a lot on Mayan political issues
                    and indigenous people's political issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>We started the training four months before the upcoming election. While we were
                    there we had the usual discussions on corruption, which were very powerful,
                    because these women were extremely frustrated with the government and decided
                    that they needed to be more proactive in how they talked about it. It was also
                    clear that the former president, R�os Montt was, at that time, trying to get
                    himself into the running for the presidency again. I guess he was prohibited by
                    the constitution from doing that. But during the last few days before the
                    training he got his pal from the supreme court [Constitutional Court] to
                    overrule whatever the constitutional prohibitions were. So he was going to run.
                    So it was a very tense time, and these women were very focused on the upcoming
                    elections.</p>
                <p>So the trainings in the field were terrific as well. The women, themselves, sort
                    of identify what is needed, and what trainers they wanted. Because they had been
                    to our training institute, they knew our trainers. So they asked us to bring
                    down Anita Perez Ferguson, who is a terrific American woman who was head of the
                    National Women's Political Caucus here. Recently, she ran for Congress, and is
                    based in California now. She's written books on women's leadership and has a
                    terrific ability to work with women at the grassroots and at the high ends and
                    to bring the two groups together. So she did an awful lot, not just on
                    leadership, but also on women working together to try to achieve their common
                    goals. She would kind of drop out, and the women would say, “Well, what's our
                    next steps?” And she would say, “What do you think your next steps should be?”
                    getting them to pull it out of themselves.</p>
                <p>What this group in Guatemala decided to do, which was very powerful, was to hold
                    a series of public forums building up to the elections and then after the
                    elections. They were going to do it across political parties. There were two
                    daughters of former presidents at our training, who were not from the same party
                    (and they didn't sit next to each other). There were also all these other Mayan
                    women from other indigenous groups who had a different agenda. We also had women
                    in government. They all decided to be a cohesive group to try to move forward
                    and even went around to start collecting dues while we were there, and so the
                    last half-day we sat in the back and gave them the space to do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And that's what the framing is. It is just being a catalyst in helping to
                    sort of release potential for this kind, and in the strengthening of their
                    skills. So that's a big part of what Vital Voices does. It tries to empower
                    individuals through these series of trainings in the field and here in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>And we do, as well, a lot of work on human trafficking. We do an e-newsletter
                    that goes to 7,000 people around the world, which is, as I said, one of the ways
                    we stay in touch with our embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Theresa, we're at August 5, 2003. Could you take a little
                        tour around the horizon? I'm using the diplomatic term and all. Where do you
                        see real signs of movement regarding bringing women into the political and
                        power process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Around the world?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and where are there real black holes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I think September 11th ... The Taliban were the enemy of the United
                    States because they first welcomed in al Qaeda, and then let al Qaeda take over
                    and then allowed al Qaeda to sponsored them.</p>
                <p>Because the Taliban played a role in the terrorist attacks as they were
                    sheltering al Qaeda, and because they were the enemy of women as they treated
                    them so badly, the Bush administration wanted to really make the point, that
                    these Taliban were the bad guys, and that if we got them out, we were the good
                    guys. That was an important point to make. Mrs. Bush gave a very beautiful,
                    substantive radio address about support for Afghan women; she also gave a UN
                    speech. They were both beautifully done. (I understand that Karen Hughes was
                    very involved in them; she told me she was.) It was very important to have the
                    commitment from the Bush administration that women's human rights were going to
                    be important and that they were important in Afghanistan. It was important to
                    have that highlighted, but then they went further and said, “And they're
                    important in other places of the world too. It's not just there.” On some TV
                    interview the President said, “It's not just Afghanistan. It's everywhere around
                    the world;” I noted every one of these things. I was probably one of the few
                    people watching any of these shows, who was writings these kinds of things
                    down.</p>
                <p>I thought that as cruel and horrible and backwards as the Taliban were, they did
                    manage to focus people's attention on this issue, and the situation allowed this
                    administration to fully embrace women's human rights, because the abuse was so
                    stark, so black and white: keeping women out of the workplace so they couldn't
                    support their families, and not letting them distribute food; keeping girls out
                    of school. These actions were just egregious; they helped the majority of
                    Americans understand that women had a bad deal in other parts of the world, and
                    that what happens to women in other parts of the world affects us here in the
                    United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>Maybe not every American was making that intellectual leap to say that a country
                    that denies women their basic rights and cuts them out of the political process
                    and does not include them as full citizens, allowing them to live up to their
                    God-given potential and make a contribution to their society and help shape the
                    destiny of their country - the most extreme case is Afghanistan, where they were
                    so extraordinarily silent and repressed and cut out - and look what that told
                    us, what was going on in that country at the time! It was an open, fertile
                    ground for terrorists to take hold; there was complete lawlessness and a
                    disconnect from the rest of the outside world.</p>
                <p>And I think there was recognition that it was not just social justice, and that
                    it would be nice if women had a better chance to get fed at the same time as
                    men, or get access to health care and not die in childbirth, and also be able to
                    actually vote and maybe run for office. It was about future security issues for
                    all countries. That changed the dynamics quite a bit, and changed the way people
                    in the world look at these issuecertainly for a lot of everyday Americans.</p>
                <p>One of the projects we're going to hear about is support for Afghan women. It was
                    one of the key issues I've worked with at State; I knew these groups extremely
                    well. I became very involved right after the fall, after September 11th, when
                    Secretary Powell and Kofi Annan announced that they were going to be involved in
                    helping to shape a new government. We actually worked with Mrs. Bush on this. We
                    brought a group of Afghan women in exile to Washington. That was actually, I
                    think, our second training. These were Afghan women who were in exile, and who
                    wanted to be able to speak to policymakers, but had had no experience in doing
                    that. They were in exile and they were shunned. Some of them were recent
                    refugees; we recognized that they didn't have the ability to speak for
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>I was asked to come up to UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women).
                    Ruchira Gupta, my friend at UNIFEM, had asked me to come up and said, “You guys
                    need to come up and do something right away at the UN,” (this was right after
                    September 11th; it was October or November), “and bring Afghan women so that
                    they are able to start speaking very publicly.” We held a forum there. We
                    invited two or three of the women we were very close to and had worked with -
                    some recently and some for years. We coached these women on the train ride up to
                    New York. We said, “Okay. This is going to be a public forum at the United
                    Nations. Why don't you talk a little bit about what your aspirations were when
                    you were growing up, and how you continued to have those aspirations, and want
                    to have a hand in shaping your country.”</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>One of the really terrific women, Belquis Ahmadi, said, “Well, while I was
                    growing up I wanted to be the governor of the province where my parents grew up
                    and where my parents were from. That was always my aspiration, and I was
                    planning to go to law school. I was on track to do that when the Soviets came in
                    and then the Taliban. I plan to be able to do that again.” And I said, “That's
                    terrific!” I said, “People would never think! They look at Afghanistan as a
                    country of women in burqas. They would have no understanding that a young woman
                    who's 30 years old would ever have grown up with that kind of aspiration. You
                    need to say that.” And she said, “Well, I can't do that. People will think
                    either that I'm grabbing power, or that's not appropriate. I can't say that.”
                    And I said, “Well, I'm going to ask you that question, so please get ready to
                    say it!”</p>
                <p>And then another woman who was with us, Farida Azizi, who's actually now on our
                    staff, and who is a more recent refugee, talked about fleeing and her flight out
                    of Afghanistan, and how she was sure that everything was going to work out, and
                    that women would be able to go back to Afghanistan, and shape what the
                    government does. She was okay speaking with me. But she was not so comfortable
                    speaking at a forum. Understandable, but we thought it was critical that you
                    don't have American Western feminists being the only ones speaking for them. For
                    so many years we had to be their voice, but now they could be their own
                    voice.</p>
                <p>So this was one of the first trainings we did. We had top-notch communications
                    people like Ann Lewis, who used to be Director of Communications in the Clinton
                    White House, come in and work with these women. We worked in the room right down
                    the hall. We had at least 12 women sitting around the table. We arranged it so
                    that the ones who were the most recently in exile and had the least outside
                    experience went first. Ann is an incredibly polished and talented professional;
                    she would say, “If you could sit down now with the leaders of the UN and the
                    U.S. government, what would you tell them is needed for Afghanistan women?” And
                    of course, they would just go and talk about everything: what it was like to
                    flee the Taliban, how their husbands were this or that, and what was going on
                    with their sons. It was critically important. Ann was so patient and so
                    wonderful with them. So the first three had got through, and had their two or
                    three points down.</p>
                <p>As soon as these women had arrived, which was right after Mrs. Bush had given her
                    radio address, we had called Mrs. Bush's office to say, “There's a group of
                    Afghan women in town, and they wanted to thank you for your radio address. Can
                    they come and visit you at the White House?” We got a call while we were in the
                    middle of this communications training. When Ann had finished working with three
                    of these women. We told the three, “The White House called, and Mrs. Bush would
                    like to meet with you.” So we got up from where we were here, on Connecticut and
                    L, and literally walked down the street to the White House, a few blocks away,
                    and stood in line. The women got cleared in, and then within a half hour to an
                    hour they were sitting in a room with Laura Bush making their three key points.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I found a picture when I was clearing all my things out. I found a very
                    touching picture of this group of Afghan women the other day. Of those women,
                    three of them were in the Loya Jirga, (traditional Afghan Grand Council) the
                    grand assembly. One of them was on MacNeil/Lehrer [NewsHour] last night [Sara
                    Amiryar], and I congratulated her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes, I saw her. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: That's my Sara! And I said, “Sara!” I said, “I'm so proud of you! You were
                    so fabulous!” She said, “It's the training and confidence you gave me.” Now that
                    woman had skills and talent galore!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I think -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But she kept saying again and again, “It's confidence,” and that's what a
                    lot of it is. It's the confidence to be able to be the one speaking up; it's not
                    that you're listening to someone else, somebody from the United States or a guy.
                    It's you who has something worthwhile to say, and it's that you have the ability
                    to do something that's really important for your country.</p>
                <p>You know, I'll just go back to this. When we started Vital Voices, Afghanistan
                    wasn't on the horizon as a key issue we were going to work on, and so Afghan
                    women weren't on the horizon either. We were responding to what happened there.
                    At the same time, we had no funding. My young colleague, Alyse Nelson, and I put
                    the airfare for these women on our personal credit cards, which our husbands
                    found out later, but not immediately! And then the way we finally funded this
                    training was fabulous. Women who had worked at AOL (America Online, Inc.) or who
                    were still working there, like Kathy Ryan, Kathy Bushkin, Jan Bryant, and
                    Colette Rhoney, just wrote us checks. These were executives and former
                    executives at AOL who wrote us checks to pay for these Afghan women to come to
                    Washington, DC. This is what we had in mind with this global partnership. Vital
                    Voices Global Partnership is working together with the world community to
                    support women's advancement; this was so critical. We could never get a grant
                    from any foundation in time -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?or gosh forbid, the U.S. government or AID [laughter].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It comes in three or four years.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>LOAR: These women at AOL, some we knew but some were new to us. They had the
                    cash; they worked together and called up their friends, and helped us put this
                    together. I really do think it was extremely important and critical and had a
                    huge effect, because to a person, these women have gone on to have a big role in
                    what goes on in their country. One of them, Belquis Ahmadi, went back and
                    finished law school and is doing a lot of work in Afghanistan on women's legal
                    rights. I believe she will be governor of her province. She's a terrific,
                    terrific, talented young woman.</p>
                <p>Sara Amiryar, who is associated with Georgetown, was on the MacNeil/Lehrer
                    NewsHour, the big PBS [Public Broadcasting Station] show last night. She was
                    part of the Loya Jirga, and has incredible stories about when women were getting
                    ready to speak at the grand assembly of the Loya Jirga, and about how - that's a
                    whole other story - the men would turn off the microphones when the women would
                    have their scheduled slots to speak. It was like dirty U.S. politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it sounds like Mayor Daily running the convention
                        [laughter].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, right. And of course when we hear these reports, we just keep
                    updating it. This is the role we play: to get the stories of what's going on
                    with these women out. So it's not just leadership training, it's being able to
                    help them raise their voices. We continue to do this. Right after this
                    leadership training, Farida Azizi appeared with Hillary Clinton on Katie Couric
                    and the Today show. Another woman from training was on Greta Van Susteren's
                    legal show on CNN, The Point. It is very powerful for these were women who are
                    literally, refugees, and are living in exile to be able to speak to the U.S.
                    press about what's happening in Afghanistan. And that's the whole idea of Vital
                    Voices: to raise their voices.</p>
                <p>So you asked about what the horizon looks like. I would say on Afghanistan, in
                    particular, it's very, very dismal. There's actually a six-hour planning meeting
                    today, that I'm going to join in the afternoon, of a number of groups here in
                    Washington who are trying to think about how to work together to keep a focus on
                    support for Afghan women. I think the Taliban were just another set of warlords.
                    They were just the warlords who were stupid enough to go in front of the cameras
                    and say, “No girls in school, no women outside the home.” But the other warlords
                    have similar points of view and are as brutal and better armed, and I think it's
                    very dismal and very difficult.</p>
                <p>I think it's extremely important that we keep the focus on Afghanistan and
                    women's human rights. Personally, myself, and as an organization, we're going to
                    keep focusing on the women in Afghanistan, because it was part of the one
                    country where there was just a general consensus that these women should not be
                    treated this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>LOAR: And if we don't get it right there, first of all as a security issue, it's
                    going to affect Central Asia, and it's going to affect everything else that
                    happens, and U.S. interests will be tremendously disadvantaged. I also think we
                    have an administration that has invested a lot in this, and they're going to
                    keep investing, so we have an opening politically. We have an opening to keep
                    the focus on and support for these women, so we shouldn't turn our attention
                    somewhere else, like Iraq, or North Korea, or wherever else our Deputy Secretary
                    of Defense Wolfowitz [Paul Wolfowitz] thinks we should be going after next. I
                    mean these were commitments that were made in a very big, public way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So I think it's very dismal.</p>
                <p>I'm encouraged by the fact that there's a recent announcement that the Bush
                    administration's going to put a lot more money into Afghanistan. I think Paula
                    Dobriansky, who's the Undersecretary of the State Department for Global Affairs,
                    is very committed to this. She has been a good partner on all the work that
                    we've tried to do on Afghanistan. I think she has been a good advocate within
                    the administration to keep the focus on women for a lot of important work. I
                    know it's not easy. If you do not have a constant advocate, the focus doesn't
                    stay there, and to have an Undersecretary as an advocate is very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's very good, and Paula is a good person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where else? I mean how about Africa? What do you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, I mean the group of women we had in recently from Africa were the
                    businesswomen that Tony Wayne had hosted over at the State Department.</p>
                <p>But of course, it wasn't on their agenda. They hadn't necessarily said they
                    wanted to talk about it; but one morning we added something to the schedule. We
                    said, “Would you businesswomen like to have a discussion about HIV/AIDS in
                    Africa?” And they said, “Yes.” So I said, “Well, we have to do it at 7:30 in the
                    morning.” We had Sandy Thurman, who was the AIDS czar in the Clinton White
                    House, a terrific woman who's now head of the International AIDS Trust. She came
                    over, and at 7:30 in the morning every one of those African women were down in
                    the hotel lobby ready for that discussion, because it is a huge fact of life for
                    all of them whether their families are affected.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>One of the women from Kenya said she was not going to get married, but is going
                    to stay celibate. As a matter of fact, she does not want to contract HIV/AIDS,
                    because she's one of the few people in her family who's healthy, and she has so
                    many children - her father's second family, her sister's children, her brother's
                    children - that she's responsible for, and some adult has to be healthy and care
                    for them. And she's a lawyer and a businesswoman and quite successful. It's just
                    heartbreaking to hear!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I think that is the overwhelming thing affecting life for women in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I'm encouraged by these public statements that have been made about the
                    Bush administration's interest and support for fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa, but
                    the money hasn't gotten there yet. It's been a lot of rhetoric. So I think
                    that's a great concern.</p>
                <p>But I do think women's economic issues, you know, women playing the role as
                    economic leaders, is just going to continue more and more now. We just had a
                    woman in here the other day from C�te d'Ivoire who works for their embassy who
                    asked us to do some work in C�te d'Ivoire with women leaders there.</p>
                <p>I think there is a huge challenge in Africa.</p>
                <p>I think in the Muslim world, we're at a real crossroads now. I look at Iraq, and
                    I'm very concerned about what's happening in Iraq concerning the status of
                    women. Because it was so closed for so long, there were not links to Iraqi women
                    who actually lived in Iraq to outside groups. Even our friends in Kuwait that we
                    had worked with said the women in Kuwait, like Lubna Al-Kazi and Rola Dashti,
                    are women who have been working for women's suffrage and are really smart
                    strategists (not being highly successful at the moment because the Kuwaiti
                    parliament just voted in more fundamentalists who would be against women's
                    suffrage), but they've been trying very hard to work with women in Iraq and
                    reach out to them, and they said every group is highly politicized and
                    polarized.</p>
                <p>So we're starting in Iraq from scratch. We've been approached by a number of
                    different groups of exiles and asked to come and work with them on women's
                    issues in Iraq and to help support women. But they don't have contacts, and they
                    don't have women to work with. So it's a very big concern, it's just starting
                    now. But there are some groups starting out.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anyone, say in Iraq, in the field with our
                        military, or their embassy, or their administration, who is doing
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, actually, this is a conversation I had with Liz Cheney [Elizabeth
                    Cheney] at the State Department, who is Deputy Assistant Secretary in the NEA
                    Bureau. She has been very public, open and focused on civil society in the
                    Middle East, and I asked her about this, particularly in Iraq. There is an
                    officer who is part of Bremer's [Paul Bremer's (Civil Administrator of the
                    Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq)] team who's focused on women and
                    democracy in governance. But I tell you, it's a huge challenge, because who is
                    organized now in the post-Saddam era? It's the clerics who are organized, and
                    the clerics have not shown themselves to be friends of women and women's
                    participation. We hear stories - they're in the paper, and I'm hearing them from
                    different networks of women because now women's groups are starting to go in. I
                    even hear it from some of the American government people who come back on trips:
                    in order for women to receive food, women have to be veiled and have to be seen
                    as appropriate, and following appropriate Muslim laws because the food
                    distribution is being done through mosques. Now they never had to do that before
                    to get food, and we shouldn't be allowing that to happen, because we're just
                    allowing, a new standard to come in. As horrible as Saddam Hussein was, it
                    wasn't a requirement that women had to go to a mosque and be judged by a cleric
                    as to whether or not they're appropriately Islamic or good Muslims before they
                    could get food. The other issue is schoolteachers who have to be veiled and
                    demonstrate other signs of their piety before they can get their salaries.</p>
                <p>These are major steps backward, and the thing that concerns me (and I'm saying
                    this on August 5, 2003), is that if the clerics stay organized and nobody else
                    is a counterweight to them, this will become the norm.. If after all the horrors
                    and the sexual violence and everything else that they suffered under Saddam
                    Hussein, these new norms being determined by clerics of how women are able to
                    conduct themselves, and of how their family relations must develop, and of what
                    role they should play in society, become institutionalized then Iraqi women will
                    have this enormous new problem. These clerics have failed and they're wrong.
                    This Iraqi population is not welcoming the clerics there; they do not want them
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>LOAR: So it's a great concern. I think Liz Cheney and Paula Dobriansky, both in
                    the State Department, are now both concerned about this. I'm not particularly
                    optimistic; I'm very concerned. I just got another email from another group
                    asking me to come over for a debrief with them; they had just come back. So
                    we're going to work quite a bit on this. I think it has a large element of
                    political will, and if it's true that women in Afghanistan had to be part of the
                    building of their country, it has to be true in Iraq as well. I know it's very
                    complicated. I read a news report where the American officials had put an
                    entirely qualified woman judge in place, and they got tremendous protests and
                    flak from the local population saying that this woman judge shouldn't be put in
                    place. So I know there are a lot of challenges there.</p>
                <p>But I also know that we have to stand for something, and if it's true in
                    Afghanistan, and if Laura Bush and President Bush said that and meant that, and
                    I believe they did then, it has to be true in Iraq! You know, we have to be
                    smart about this, and we have to see it as in our interest and not sort of allow
                    that to go under the radar or let it go. This way this could become the new
                    standard.</p>
                <p>So I'm concerned about that; but, I do think that there are some players in the
                    State Department who are committed to not letting things go backwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in the Pentagon? Do you have contacts in the
                        Pentagon, because this is where a lot of the administration is coming
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Um?no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I would say when we had the President's Interagency Council on Women during
                    the Clinton administration, we had representatives in the Pentagon. We had a lot
                    of work we were doing with women in the military. I don't have those contacts
                    now and I don't know who is in a position to do those kinds of things now. You
                    know, a lot of the work we do and the contacts we have are with the State
                    Department. After reading in the newspaper yesterday that Secretary Powell and
                    Richard Armitage might be stepping down at the end of this term, there are a lot
                    of broken hearts, I think, at the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But I think we don't really have a relationship with the Pentagon, the
                    military - and I'm open to this. I'd like to influence who's ever working and
                    can have an impact on women's lives, but that opportunity hasn't presented
                    itself.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with Russia? I mean how are things going
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, we just had a group in. You know, one of the three areas we work on
                    is trafficking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And including the Ukraine in this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Well, this is an area we've done a lot of work on and we have long
                    ties to various Russians that we have worked with. Actually, the Library of
                    Congress has a terrific program called the Open World Program, and they bring
                    about 900 emerging Russian leaders, men and women, to the United States every
                    year. Gerry Otremba [Geraldine Otremba], who's the head of that program, and
                    whom we've worked with now for about a year and a half, has asked us. We've
                    worked with her to do trainings here in the United States. We did three
                    trainings last year. We just completed one last week with emerging women leaders
                    on a whole range of issues: women's political leadership across the country;
                    women's entrepreneurship and economic development; and trafficking. Human
                    trafficking is one of the areas that we've been asked to do some more work on.
                    This training we did last year of Russian women from all across the country
                    included journalists, service providers and advocates, and some government
                    officials from the Ministry of Interior in Russia. We always try to bring in
                    government officials into our trainings because whatever the ills or social
                    problems are, or other issues affecting women, government has to be part of the
                    solution. Sometimes people are reluctant to have government in our trainings.
                    But I'm from the government, I know government can make a change, and we know
                    that every country, any country, has progressive people who are trying to do
                    good things for women.</p>
                <p>So what came out of this was there were tremendous tensions between the women in
                    the Ministry of Interior (you know, the tough guy ministry) who a year ago, in
                    October, set up a task force on trafficking and some of these NGO service
                    providers who saw no response from the government and had no faith in the
                    government. But, over the course of the ten days with us, the two groups
                    devolved a new collaboration. They were going to actually set up some of the
                    models and some of the things that we had done here, which are holding public
                    briefings and inviting NGOs for consultations, and things, which when we did
                    them, the State Department was horrified about, but now have become standard.
                    The Russians looked at some of these, and were encouraged to do them. After this
                    training, we received a letter from the Ministry of Interior asking us to do a
                    training for this Ministry of Interior task force, which was very encouraging.
                    It included ten men and two women. We just completed that, and this was a big
                    breakthrough.</p>
                <pb facs="0258" n="Page0258"/>
                <p>It was very interesting to hear these men, some of whom are law enforcement
                    experts in organized crime, and others work closely with their counterterrorism,
                    work against organized crime, talk in these heartfelt ways about the suffering
                    of Russian women who've been trafficked into France, and about how they worked
                    with France to get these women back and about how they have worked to lock up
                    the traffickers without a law. The overwhelming message that we were encouraging
                    them to deliver around town is that they have a lot of capacity, but they need a
                    law. They're close to getting a law in Russia, but they're not there yet.</p>
                <p>The issue we worked most closely with Russia on is this issue of human
                    trafficking: the corruption it is connected with, the tremendous effect it has
                    primarily on the women from Russia, and of course, the degradation of their
                    lives. But also Russia is a destination point; and to hear these law enforcement
                    guys who are trying to work on legislation, shattered every stereotype you would
                    have of tough guys in the Ministry of Interior. They were just appalled to see
                    people from Chechnya brought in, and sold as slaves, and people from other parts
                    of the former Soviet Union, from Central Asia, being used on construction sites
                    and not being paid. It was basically slave labor. This issue includes men of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: So it was really an eye-opener for us. We, of course had meetings at the
                    State Department. This group of Russians were very blunt with the State
                    Department, saying, “You issue your reports on trafficking, and you are way
                    off!”</p>
                <p>So what we did was to act as a way for the government officials in Russia working
                    on trafficking to interface with government officials of the United States and
                    the State Department and the Justice Department. That was a great role to play,
                    I have to say! It's important, and it needs to happen, because Russia's close to
                    getting a law. The U.S. could be helpful in that in being a partner by pushing
                    this law and in encouraging that to happen. I think a law will have a good
                    effect in Russia, when that does happen. They'll be able to prosecute the cases,
                    because some of the prosecutors who came in, those who have the responsibility
                    for that, were very frustrated, because they can prosecute people on kidnapping
                    or bringing people across lines for illegal activity, but they can't prosecute
                    them for the act of trafficking. Of course, that's one of the things we are able
                    to do here in the United States because of the new anti-trafficking law. And, we
                    know how hard it is to get a law passed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>LOAR: So I have great sympathy for them. And I think in Russia, though, we are
                    seeing more women in the Duma and women playing leadership roles in the Duma.
                    One of the ideas that came out recently was to have us work with some of the
                    women judges, so that they could be more effective in the work they're trying to
                    do. They're in these positions of responsibilities; and they have asked for some
                    help and work on how they can affect the judicial system. There are women in the
                    Duma and deputy ministers who are really determined to stand up for women; and
                    it's not just to stand up for women, but to be able to play a role in what goes
                    on in that country. They have great pride in Russia, and they have great pride
                    in their heritage, and they see that if they're not there and publicly fighting
                    alongside their male colleagues, that they're not going to have a voice; they're
                    not going to have a say. So there's a lot of challenges ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Ukraine, because this is a big country which
                        is often overlooked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. Well, Ukraine, we've been asked. The Library of Congress Open World
                    Program has added Ukraine. They're, I think, in the process now of getting final
                    congressional approval for a program that comes through really working with
                    women leaders from the Ukraine, and that's very exciting.</p>
                <p>We have a partner from Ukraine we've worked with for several years, Oksana
                    Horbunova, who is a leader there, and is a very charming, ladylike woman, who
                    wears lavender suits and speaks in a very high pitched voice. She talks about
                    how she goes up to the criminals; she gets a rage in her voice when she talks
                    about what they do to destroy women and their families through trafficking. And
                    she is unbelievable! She had worked in the Ministry of Interior in Ukraine
                    (there's something to be said for government service), and she understood how
                    they looked at this issue. I mean she went out and worked used to with an NGO on
                    this, and now works with the government. So in a very unique way, was able to
                    get her own government to look at this. That is a big challenge!</p>
                <p>It used to be that she had a hot line. Congressman Chris Smith was actually
                    involved in one of the hot line cases, which is not a big surprise because he's
                    so involved in trafficking. There were some girls from Ukraine who were
                    trafficked into Montenegro, and through the hot line Oksana recognized that. I
                    guess their mothers called, and they knew where they were; Congressman Chris
                    Smith was able to do something with the authorities in Montenegro, and the girls
                    were able to return home. What Oksana used to do was go to the airport to meet
                    the girls and to bring them to safety. But the traffickers knew when the girls
                    were coming back, and they would be at the airport too. So she was really
                    putting herself in a very dangerous position going to the airport. Through her
                    incredible smarts and charm and the way she's persistent, she was able to get
                    her government to join her when these girls came back; now she goes to the
                    airport with government officials. So the traffickers know that she has some
                    officials in her government and some government backing for the work she's
                    trying to do, and I think that's extremely impressive.</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>We got to know Oksana back in 1997 at the first Vital Voices Conference in
                    Vienna, and she's been part of our global retreats and our trainings. Now she
                    comes and conducts the trainings for Russian women, and she'll be part our
                    Ukraine training, whether it's on trafficking or something else, because she is
                    someone who is really having an effect on what goes on in her country. There's
                    tremendous challenges there, there's huge corruption, and there's huge political
                    violence; but I think when one woman breaks through, that helps other women to
                    break through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Internet? Is this making a difference? I
                        mean it allows anyone to do anything. I was wondering whether it gives women
                        more of a feeling of being part of a movement and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, we have a fabulous web site here at Vital Voices. It was funded by
                    AOL Time Warner Foundation, which is just fabulous; and our web communications
                    director here, Diana Pineda, is very creative in keeping that up, and it is a
                    fabulous tool. It is a way for people to learn about what's going on with women
                    around the world, and for women around the world to be able to connect with each
                    other. Actually, just this morning, I was talking to my colleague down the hall
                    to say the women in Guatemala really wanted to go forward to the next step; they
                    wanted to be able to touch base with us sort of a month after the training to
                    tell us where they were and strategize a little bit. So we said, “Well, let's do
                    an online chat or do an Internet chat - some way to bring these women together.”
                    Now, we're not fluent Spanish speakers, as I had mentioned before, but we have
                    the capacity to bring somebody in to help us do this. So we think we'll be able
                    to do this. So it's not like you have to travel back and forth to be able to
                    bring people together to say, “Okay, where are we since our last sessions or
                    trainings together? How do we go forward?” We've also done that with a group
                    that we did our training with in Vietnam. It was slow and tedious, but we were
                    able to talk to each other for about an hour and a half on a chat and sort of
                    strategize for our next step.</p>
                <p>It's as an information tool that the Internet is unbelievable! We've heard this
                    with this trafficking newsletter that we do, that reaches people all over the
                    world, that we put on our web site. So, in addition to the internet being used
                    to send out e-mails, through the resource of this newsletter on the internet,
                    people hear about others working in their own countries they didn't know about
                    who are working on the same issues. We get e-mails all the time from people
                    saying, “Thank you for putting us in touch with this other group in Nepal; we're
                    going to be meeting with them.”</p>
                <p>We get groups from New Jersey, my hometown in New Jersey where I grew up. When I
                    grew up there, as you know from the beginning of this conversation, the
                    population in my area was primarily Irish, Polish, Italian, and Jewish families.
                    After all seven of us kids moved out, and after my parents retired, and my dad
                    passed away, more and more Asian Indian immigrants moved in. So, now the
                    population of the town is about 80 to 90 percent Indian.</p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hmm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It's also been a destination point for women trafficked from India. It just
                    breaks my heart, that Iselin, New Jersey (where, by the way, Chris Smith, the
                    congressman, is also from) is a destination point for trafficked women. It was a
                    group working in New Jersey that went onto our web site and said, “We'd like to
                    take your materials and translate them into Hindu to use in New Jersey.” And I
                    thought, “Of course! But it can't be Iselin, my hometown, where people are
                    brought into and the sent out to?” Apparently, the destination points are
                    factories, domestic servitude and brothels. And Iselin was one of the three
                    target points in New Jersey for the work that this group was trying to do. This
                    group in New Jersey, that's trying to really get the word out and work with the
                    immigrant communities from India, was going to translate all our materials and
                    all our fax sheets about what trafficking is, what hot lines to call, what your
                    rights in the United States are, into Hindu. So the website a tremendous tool.
                    You put it up there, you put the information out there, and it is just terrific
                    for people to be able to get information.</p>
                <p>Because we have such a strong relationship with the Library of Congress, and the
                    Open World Forum, which has been such a strong successful program, we've
                    translated a lot of their materials for their Russian trainings into Russian. We
                    make that available to everybody who comes to our trainings. This way, they can
                    get the latest materials and see things on our web site. We're striving to get
                    more and more foreign language content, because you don't want to exclude to
                    those who just know “ingl�s” (English).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Well, one of the things that I've noticed
                        that's now very popular, which was certainly not even a thought when I went
                        to school back in the '40s, is gender studies. I have a feeling that an
                        awful lot of it is American-focused. I was wondering whether you have been
                        able to make contact with the people who do gender studies, and push the
                        trafficking thing on a world-wide basis. It's a good place to catch very
                        committed, young women (some young men, but mostly young women) and to make
                        them aware of the problem and say, “You can do something about this.” This
                        way you'll send out some good anti-trafficking zealots.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. Well, I am very practical and very focused on projects and action.
                    We've done some good work with gender studies here in the United States, but a
                    lot of it is just theory.</p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>The real practical work of standing up for women's rights and supporting women
                    and encouraging women, for me comes more from international studies. Often; when
                    I speak on college campuses, it's not at the invitation of gender studies. I
                    prefer to speak to those focused on the international front, because I think
                    that is where the action is. It is there that people ask questions like: how do
                    we get the kind of future we want, what are the effects of globalization, and
                    how do we work towards a more secure America, women's participation and fighting
                    corruption. Going up against trafficking is all part of that important subject.
                    That is, I think, a very practical approach to it.</p>
                <p>When I was in college, as you know, I studied literature and music, but I was
                    always concerned about issues affecting women around the world. When I came into
                    the Foreign Service, and at my posts in Mexico and in Korea, I had two things I
                    was always interested in: religion and church (and especially the Catholic
                    Church), and the status of women. I had no idea that it would lead me to working
                    full-time from 1994 till now, 2003, on women's progress around the world. So I
                    don't think gender studies is necessary for you to be able to work full-time on
                    women's human rights and trafficking. However, I'm not really familiar totally
                    with the course work, to tell you the truth.</p>
                <p>But I do think that it is important to continue trying to get women's human
                    rights and trafficking integrated into foreign policy, and into the academic,
                    international curriculum. I do work with professors, and with people who are
                    doing studies on how women's issues and foreign policy relate, on what the
                    differences are, and on how to build these issues into the curriculum. I think
                    that's important and interesting.</p>
                <p>But I think part of it is that I think there's a recognition like there's never
                    been before, that we can't build the kind of future we want without women's
                    participation. Now, maybe I'm saying that because that's my life, but I've been
                    thinking about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, no, but -</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I really do think we've reached a turning point. When we held a benefit to
                    raise money for our work, there was an award ceremony at the Kennedy Center, my
                    younger brother, Vincent Loar, is an over-the-road truck driver. wrote me a
                    check for $250. He also asked, “Who needs it most in the world?” I said, “Well,
                    right now the women in Haiti are in really bad shape, and they're facing a lot
                    of political violence.” He said, “Okay, I'm going to go talk to the other truck
                    drivers about women in Haiti,” so he is going and trying to get other support
                    for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>LOAR: I think there's just an understanding that what goes on with women in other
                    parts of the world affects us in the United States. So I'm just hoping that that
                    concern continues to be matched at that level. I think we're making a lot of
                    progress in building the private sector into this with corporate support. We
                    work a lot with corporations. I mentioned Liz Claiborne, who's a good corporate
                    partner for us; but there are others as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of our great concerns today, and certainly a
                        concern of the administration, is terrorism and how to combat it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you see a tie between the plight of women and
                        terrorism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, the most extreme case was in Afghanistan where al Qaeda took root.
                    They took root because it was lawless. The Taliban had no agenda or ability to
                    govern other than to suppress and control. And, of course, the first group they
                    went after was women, and that's a sign. The threatening of not just women's
                    rights, but also of their ability to earn a livelihood and to live their lives
                    as productive members of the family and community should be a sign to
                    policymakers, and to those who are concerned about human security. That was an
                    extreme case there in Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>But if we look at it, the exclusion of people from the mainstream of their
                    country was fertile ground for terrorism, because you just don't have an open,
                    public society, democratic or otherwise, that allows a variety of players to
                    affect what goes on in that country.</p>
                <p>As you know, the real causes of terrorism are complex; people have spoken quite a
                    bit about what they are. I do think that if you have an open society where all
                    citizens are valued and human rights are respected, it's a hard place for
                    terrorism to take hold, because the “values” of terrorism would not be
                    consistent with values that respect the individual and value people's
                    participation in building their country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as one looks at this, right now at least, most of
                        the terrorism is coming right out of the Islamic world, and it's coming out
                        of the extreme right wing of the Wahhabi, or whatever you want to call it,
                        branch of Islam, which denigrates women.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right, and excludes women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excludes them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>LOAR: Yes, it denigrates and excludes them; a lot of Muslim women have been very
                    frustrated by that for a long time. Women in Central Asia are very concerned
                    about mosques going up that are funded by these groups. Their time, the time of
                    Wahhabism, I think, has to be over, as we see it. Look where the 9-11 terrorists
                    came from. Look where the people who damaged the United States came from?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came from out of Saudi Arabia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Right. These are not places that are friendly to women -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: ?and parts of Yemen. There are people in the Yemeni government, and the
                    Yemeni ambassador here, who are terrific and really want to have women in the
                    mainstream. But, there has to be a more aggressive effort.</p>
                <p>It's interesting to see that the governments of Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait have
                    talked to us about working with them on training programs for women. This did
                    not happen before September 11th, and they're not doing it for the PR value.
                    They actually want some good work being done; that's encouraging. But I think we
                    have a long way to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any connection to Saudi Arabia yet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Well, not in ways I'll talk about here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But there's a little glimmer of hope there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, Theresa, I think maybe we've come to the end of
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Yes. There's just one thing I wanted to highlight, and it doesn't go
                    chronologically, but I don't think I talked about this time when I was leaving
                    the Clinton administration and the Powell team was coming in. Did we talk about
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: It was a very interesting thing and says a lot about Colin Powell, I think.
                    I started this as a Foreign Service officer. I spent fourteen years at the State
                    Department: ten as a Foreign Service officer; and four as a political appointee
                    in the Senior Executive Service as the Senior Coordinator for International
                    Women's Issues. As I was leaving, there was an opportunity to do a briefing for
                    Secretary Powell, a Global Affairs briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: Everybody was very excited about Colin Powell coming in. He has great
                    charisma and great stature. People were very enthusiastic about coming in to
                    brief the new incoming Secretary. There was this round table conference room (I
                    think it was a lovely conference room at State; we always knew the best ones
                    because we tried to use them [laughter] for our meetings with women), and I was
                    sitting at the table, and Colin Powell comes in. He's two seats away from me and
                    went around and asked us all to introduce ourselves. He didn't walk in with any
                    staff; he walked in with this small little notepad, and there weren't any thugs
                    to push people around and tell them where to sit or what to do; he just came in
                    for the briefing.</p>
                <p>We went around the table, and a number of people spoke. Then he came back to me,
                    and he just asked me to introduce myself. I didn't do a really full briefing. He
                    came back to me after listening to everyone and said, “Now I've heard from other
                    people about this thing on women, and what went on. Tell me a little bit about
                    this President's Interagency Council on Women, because I haven't heard anybody
                    brief on that.” I had been specifically told that I wasn't supposed to talk
                    about that because that was outside the State Department. There were other
                    reasons at play as well, but I said, “Oh, well, thank you sir,” and I explained
                    what it was. He then asked what the focus was. I said, “Well, there's actually
                    been a great deal of work done in trafficking, sir.”</p>
                <p>And you know, that's when the eyebrows across the table began to stare daggers at
                    me, as there was this big debate when I was leaving the administration as to how
                    we were to implement the trafficking law. Do we take trafficking and keep it at
                    a high level with the Under Secretary, which is where we had it; and all these
                    government task forces; or do we move them into the office called Drugs and
                    Thugs, INL (Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs)? And
                    I thought it would be a big step down to put it into Drugs and Thugs, even
                    though I loved the guy who was the Assistant Secretary at the time, Rand Beers,
                    who's just recently resigned over the Iraqi intelligence policy, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rand Beers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0266" n="Page0266"/>
                <p>LOAR: Rand Beers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interviewing him. I interviewed him yesterday.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: He is a very talented, bureaucratic, intellectual, smart guy. It was
                    nothing personal, and I knew he didn't think it was. I simply didn't think
                    trafficking and the government task forces belonged in Drugs and Thugs; I didn't
                    think that was broad enough. There was an ambassador, Wendy Chamberlin, who was
                    determined to move it there; I didn't think she had a very good understanding of
                    what was needed to address the issue at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: I thought she was playing dirty pool in the way she was addressing it. But
                    I thought Rand, this was, okay, fine! You feel that way; I feel this way! The
                    Undersecretary at the time, Frank Loy, had a strong feeling it should go to
                    Rand. So I wasn't supposed to talk about it.</p>
                <p>But Secretary Powell asked me something about the Interagency Council, so I
                    thought, “Well, sir, one of the key issues was trafficking. That allowed us to
                    work across the government, with the CIA, with the Justice Department, and with
                    HHS on developing a comprehensive policy for trafficking. We were able to put
                    that into law. Now there's a new law. There's going to be a government task
                    force. But one of the things you're going to be asked, sir, is how the State
                    Department handles this.” And I didn't say it was my point of view, but that,
                    “there was some concern that this would be turned into just a criminal issue and
                    moved to INL. So you're going to get that question sir, when you go up for your
                    hearings.”</p>
                <p>And, he asked me something else, and he said, “Tell me about Vital Voices,”
                    because someone had raised that. I explained what we were doing, and that I was
                    leaving the administration, leaving the government to do that, and hoped to work
                    with his State Department. He said, “Well, it sounds to me like Vital Voices is
                    taking the frontal ground of democracy and planting seedlings, and we will work
                    very nicely together.” And then someone else said, “Oh Sir, let me tell you
                    something else we did on women,” it was the Africa Bureau, and then AID, and
                    then the Human Rights Bureau, and than almost everyone. There was actually a
                    very good discussion.</p>
                <p>Afterwards, my friend Tony Wayne, the Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs,
                    who was at the briefing, asked me, “What's going on in trafficking?” And I said,
                    “Well, there's this big battle.” He said, “Oh, well, why don't you write a note
                    to the Secretary?” I said, “Well, it has to go through channels.” He said, “Oh,
                    really?” Like here I am following the rules for 14 years, okay [laughter], and
                    I'm realizing, “What do you mean?” and he just said, “Oh, really?” Okay.</p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: And he said, “Why don't you just give me a memo. Just express your point of
                    view on what should be done and why you think that.” So I wrote this careful
                    memo.</p>
                <p>You know, it was really emotional leaving the State Department after 14 years. My
                    husband and I had had a great time there; our kids had great experiences
                    overseas, and I had loved the work I had done on international women's issues.
                    It was tough to leave.</p>
                <p>But, wrapping up on leaving, I had a call from Grant Green, who was the chief of
                    transition, and who's now the Undersecretary of Management for Secretary Powell.
                    He said, “Oh, why don't you come in and talk to us about this?” That became a
                    week and a half of long discussions with Grant Green and Paula Dobriansky, who
                    was to become the Undersecretary for Global Affairs. We discussed how you would
                    address trafficking and how you would work just on international women's issues
                    themselves. It was the most unbelievably intellectually rigorous, respectful
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>At one point, Grant Green asked me to come in and talk to Dick [Richard] Armitage
                    and express to him why I thought trafficking should be housed in Global Affairs.
                    I asked people about him, and they said, “Well, Armitage is a tough cookie. You
                    know, he bench presses 440. If you're going to go in and talk with him, you'd
                    better know what you're doing!” My response was, “Great! I'm ready to do
                    that!”</p>
                <p>I went in and talked with Dick Armitage. He was the most gentlemanly guy going,
                    but he pounded me with questions. “Why, if this is so important, didn't you guys
                    knock it out?” I answered him, “Did you knock out drug trafficking when you were
                    in government before?” Then we talked about comparisons between human and drug
                    trafficking. His response was, “Why don't we just move all our forces behind
                    it?” This was the same ridiculous idea that Wendy Chamberlain had, that if you
                    use the military and you do all this stuff on human trafficking, you'll knock it
                    out. And I said, “There's a difference here. This is not a plant that's being
                    shipped across borders. These are human beings, so you can't treat them like a
                    plant! It's not like drugs are consumed, and that's the end of it. This is a
                    human being. So you have to have human rights components with it every step of
                    the way, and repatriation, and ways to warn people off, and special ways you
                    treat them when they're rescued or when they're returned home.”</p>
                <p>I was so impressed with Armitage. He was so charming, intelligent, and tough, and
                    I thought it must be a great time to be in the State Department. To have that
                    high level of interest and interaction on trafficking was just stunning. I had
                    great conversations with both Paula and Grant. And Grant is a colonel in the
                    military, so he asked me for org charts (organizational charts), and I could
                    only respond: “Well, sir, I don't do those!”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>LOAR: But it was very emotionally difficult, because here I was trying to pull
                    myself out of my job and the State Department, and yet here I was being asked
                    about everything I was doing. It was so fabulous to be able to have a voice in
                    how they were going to address these issues. I had a conversation with Paula
                    Dobriansky about a month ago on something else in her office. It was also a
                    little bit difficult, because it was on something related to trafficking. But,
                    on the way out I said, “I always appreciated those conversations we had at the
                    transition.” And she said, “I really appreciated, right from the very beginning,
                    when you came in to give us advice, some of which we followed.” It was just so
                    gratifying. I give them a lot of credit because they wanted to look at what
                    could be done to keep this work going.</p>
                <p>The Interagency Council on Women did disband, which I thought it should, because,
                    while I thought it had played an important role after Beijing, I didn't know
                    where it would go after 2000. Also, the new law required interagency work,
                    though they're not doing that yet. I'm hoping they get to it soon, now that
                    we're moving into three years after the laws passed.</p>
                <p>Regarding the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues, G (Bureau of
                    Global Affairs) waited six months and then Paula Dobriansky sent an action memo
                    to Secretary Powell saying, “This is to discuss the issue of whether the Senior
                    Coordinator for International Women's Issues position should be continued.” That
                    was in July of 2001. The memo says they surveyed in the State Department and
                    what role it played there, and they determined that it was a very helpful role,
                    and that people in the State Department wanted it to continue. Paula recommended
                    to Secretary Powell that the position be continued; and there was a check off
                    where he said he agreed and concurred. I thought that was a clever thing to do,
                    because if they had done this right at the beginning, the right wing would have
                    come in and put in somebody who would just try to unravel and undo
                    everything.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LOAR: G really wanted to see what role was necessary and what role it could play.
                    I thought it was terrific. I'm gratified that that continues. I really do think
                    Paula Dobriansky, the Undersecretary, really carries the agenda, which is very
                    important.</p>
                <p>I wanted to talk a little bit about that transition, because it was respectful,
                    intellectually rigorous and very encouraging. I've been grateful that Colin
                    Powell, Dick Armitage and Paula Dobriansky were there, because I now think that
                    it wasn't rhetoric, and it wasn't for political purposes, they do think this is
                    important. It will be sad when they are not there anymore.</p>
