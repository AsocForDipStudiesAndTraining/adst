                <p>G. LEWIS SCHMIDT</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Allen Hansen </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 8, 1988</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Introduction</p>
                <p>The first part of this (greatly restructured) interview deals extensively with
                    the establishment and early years of the USIS program in Japan. It is difficult
                    to fit a short description of the conditions prevalent in the country at the end
                    of WWII into the flow of narrative once the interview begins. Therefore, the
                    following paragraphs are given as an introduction to the Japanese part of the
                    interview. It is also well to remember that USIS did not begin operations as
                    such in Japan until six and a half years after the War's end. The Army had
                    handled all in country informational work up to April 29, 1952, the effective
                    date of the Peace Treaty.</p>
                <p>Although there were similarities between the situation in Japan and Germany at
                    the end of WWII, there were substantial differences. There had been no ground
                    war in Japan. Urban destruction except in Kyoto, had been great, but the
                    countryside had not been ruined in battle. The decision of MacArthur to retain
                    the Emperor gave the people a symbol of continuity and cohesion. The Government
                    was basically intact. The country was not plagued by a refugee problem. Despite
                    a few fanatic military officers, there was no Nazi-like menace to search out.
                    The populace, once it discovered its own government propaganda about the horrors
                    of American occupation were unfounded, was friendly to the point of
                    embarrassment. They were sick of their own military and police, ashamed of
                    having precipitated the war, and for the most part cooperative.</p>
                <p>A major difference between Japan and Germany was the fact that the media were
                    still organizationally intact as the war ended. Newspaper publication might have
                    been temporarily suspended and radio broadcasting momentarily discontinued, but
                    the personnel and operational structure were all in place. There was little fear
                    that if allowed to publish or broadcast, the media would become a source of
                    dangerous subversion or public incitement. Therefore, there was no need as in
                    Germany and Austria, to create and staff new papers or radio broadcasting
                    stations. Scarcity of newsprint and reporting talent restricted the size and
                    reporting of existing papers, and lack of adequate transmitter facilities as
                    well as shortages of trained broadcasters and technical personnel curtailed
                    radio output, but those shortcomings would correct themselves in time.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the fall of the nation had destroyed the monetary base.
                    Monetary holdings were worthless. People from previously wealthy to poor had no
                    means of buying anything. Supplies of everything from food and clothing to the
                    barest necessities of life were in critically short supply. Economic ruin was
                    complete.</p>
                <p>The Japanese psyche had suffered a terrible blow. It was their first and only
                    loss to an outside enemy, a condition previously unthinkable. There was a wide
                    spread sense of shame and loss of confidence. Even at the end of the occupation,
                    this feeling of insecurity and guilt and not fully dissipated.</p>
                <p>From the informational point of view, the Japanese had been shut off from the
                    outside world certainly from the time of Pearl Harbor, but in many ways since
                    the late '30's when the military took control of the government and censored all
                    media. They were hungry for information about everything. Though benign, the
                    Occupation was careful to control what the Japanese could read. This restriction
                    was gradually eased, but it meant that the Occupation supplied libraries were
                    popular, and since these formed the countrywide base for the post-Occupation
                    USIS program the army's Civil Information and Education program (CI&amp;E)
                    offered USIS a ready made platform from which to launch operations.</p>
                <p>Short Summary of Career in Department of State'sUSIA Predecessor
                    Organizations</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side 1, Tape 1 of Session 1 of an interview with
                        G. Lewis Schmidt, a retired Foreign Service officer of USIA being conducted
                        February 8, 1988 at his home in McLean, Virginia. The interviewer is Allen
                        Hansen. Transferring over from the Department of Agriculture, Lew Schmidt
                        began his State Department career in 1949 as a budget analyst for the U.S.
                        Information and Education Program of the Department of State, the forerunner
                        of USIA. During the next 23 years, until his retirement in November of 1972,
                        he held a number of high positions with the Agency. In 1952 he became the
                        Executive Officer of USIS Tokyo at the time the Japanese peace treaty had
                        just been signed. In 1956 he was the Deputy Director and Acting Director of
                        USIS in Brazil until medically evacuated after having contracted polio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>He went on to become Deputy Assistant Director and Acting Director of Latin
                    American Operations from 1957 to 1959, Assistant Director of the Agency for
                    Administration, 1960-64, Acting Deputy Director of the Agency for a few months
                    in 1960-61 prior to the Kennedy transition team's arrival, U.S. Consul General
                    in Izmir, Turkey, Country Public Affairs Officer in Thailand and, prior to his
                    retirement, Director of the USIA Resource Analysis Staff.</p>
                <p>Getting Into USIA Affairs was an Accident of Circumstances</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Lew, let's begin by telling us about how you happened to become a Budget Analyst
                    in the State Department's Information and Education Program in 1949.</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Before I do that I just want to back up a minute. My government career
                    actually began in 1940 after I came out of graduate school at Harvard. But, I
                    had had a 2nd Lieutenant Reserve Commission in the Army, so, of course, the Army
                    picked me up and I spent the next 5+ years in the Army and then was in private
                    business in California for a couple of years. Because I had worked for
                    Agriculture for a year and two months before I went into the Army, when I left
                    private business on the west coast, I came back to Agriculture and transferred
                    over to the Department of State in the fall of 1949.</p>
                <p>I had not previously been in budgetary activities. In fact, my education had been
                    in Political Science and Economics. I was Economic Officer for the Military
                    Government Section of Sixth Army and First Corps during the first year of
                    occupation in Japan, and I really had never expected to get into the
                    administrative area. But after going back to Agriculture, I looked around and
                    decided that if I was ever going to reach executive levels in the Department or
                    anywhere else I probably better know something about the budgetary
                    operation.</p>
                <p>So I talked to Mr. Robertson, Ralph Robertson, who at that time was the Director
                    of Budget and Finance for Agriculture. And he made me a Section Chief in the
                    Budget Division of Agriculture. And after about a year and a half in that
                    position, some friends of mine who wanted me to come over and work with them in
                    State got me into State. I had always been interested in going into the Foreign
                    Service, I wanted to go to State for that reason.</p>
                <p>Since my most recent experience had been in budget and there was a vacancy in the
                    Budget Division at that time, I went into the budget operation in State. The
                    vacancy happened to be in the area which was concerned with preparing and
                    defending the budget for the U.S. Information and Education Program, USIE, which
                    at that time, of course, was a part of the Department of State. So that's how I
                    happened to get into the budget operation, and subsequently into Government
                    Information programs.</p>
                <p>I advanced so rapidly in the budget area that it was hard to get back out of it.
                    It took me about seven years to escape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Section of the State Department's Budget
                        Division that handled Budget work for the Office which was actually the
                        forerunner of USIA. Were you and your colleagues for or against the idea of
                        a separate information agency? What was the atmospherics at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1950 Attitudes In USIE About Separating From Department of State</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, of course, when I first came in I really knew so little about USIA
                    or USIE as it then was known that I didn't initially have any strong opinion.
                    However, it didn't take me very long to realize what was happening. Because at
                    that time the Chief of the Division of Budget in the Department of State, a man
                    named Ed Wilbur, didn't like USIE. And USIE was sort of a stepchild in the
                    department anyway. The old line Foreign Service didn't have very much use for it
                    and looked upon us as second or even third class citizens. And that was often
                    not very pleasant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USIE is what the office was called at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, it's now USIA but it was then the United States Information and
                    Education Office of the State Department's Bureau of Public Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, I also discovered that Wilbur, who was always trying to gain
                    influence with John Rooney, the head of the Congressional Subcommittee that
                    heard our Foreign Service appropriations requests on the Hill, was behind our
                    backs, going up and seeing Rooney and telling him that this group at USIE isn't
                    that important. And if we can get money for [a certain] program in State you can
                    cut out some of this junk at USIE. So Rooney was often following Ed Wilbur's
                    lead, giving USIE a bad time and cutting its request, to obtain money for one or
                    another appropriation at State.</p>
                <p>Things got a little better when Henry Ford succeeded Wilbur, who went up to be
                    the head of the Office of Budget and Fiscal Affairs in the Department of State.
                    But even so State did consider USIE sort of second class. Understandably, before
                    long I also began to feel that the operation would be better served if it were
                    separate from the Department of State. Although, of course, I had no influence,
                    at that point I did join the general feeling that things should be handled that
                    way.</p>
                <p>Events Leading To Assignment To Tokyo in January, 1951</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left the Budget Office you ended up in Tokyo. How
                        did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, to give you a little background on that, Henry Ford soon left the
                    position of Budget Division Chief, but before leaving, he had made me Deputy
                    Chief of the Budget Division. Then he shortly left to become the Executive
                    Director of the Near East Bureau for the Department of State, and so for a time
                    I was left as the Acting Director of the Budget Division.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>About that time (late 1951) the peace treaty with Japan was signed, and it was
                    obvious we were soon going to take over the Army information operation in Tokyo.
                    [Then called the Civil Information and Education (CI&amp;E) program of GHQSCAP
                    (General Headquarters, Supreme Commander, Allied Powers Stanford University).]
                    USIE was looking for someone who had both Japanese experience and also budgetary
                    and administrative experience. So we struck a bargain. I agreed that I would
                    like to go back to Japan in that capacity if they felt that I was the person to
                    handle the job.</p>
                <p>Background of Experience in Japan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where had your Japanese experience come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: It started in 1938 or even earlier. I was the American Chairman of a
                    University level Student organization called the Japan-America Student
                    Conference. It was an Exchange Program between U.S. and Japanese university
                    students completely organized, planned and run by students—no Senior Support or
                    controlling group. I had attended the 4th Annual meeting of this program in 1937
                    at Stanford University. I was elected chairman of the U.S. delegation for the
                    5th Conference to be held in Japan. So, I organized the American delegation in
                    1938 and led it to Japan for the summer meeting of 1938. After the conference we
                    traveled extensively in Japan, then to Manchukuo, which was at that time under
                    Japanese control, and Korea.</p>
                <p>When I came back to the States I had gotten a fairly wide exposure to Japan. Of
                    course, no real knowledge in depth. Because of that experience when the war came
                    on and when the American Army was preparing after VE Day, or even before VE Day,
                    was preparing to invade Japan, they were looking around for military officers
                    who had had exposure to Japan. You can imagine that in 1944, '43, '44, nobody in
                    the Army had—or at least a very few people in the Army—had ever had any first
                    hand knowledge of Japan at all. Because I had been there, even though briefly,
                    the Army picked me up for the Military Government operation, and I spent nine
                    months studying the Japanese language and Japanese area studies. Eventually I
                    went to the Philippines and from there into Japan after the armistice was signed
                    in September, 1945. I spent nine to ten months of the first year of the
                    Occupation in Japan during which time I was the Economics Officer for the
                    Military Government Section of the Headquarters of Sixth Army located in Kyoto,
                    and in charge of all Southwestern Japan during the early Occupation. Again, in
                    1951 there weren't all that many people in DepState with my background who had
                    been in Japan. And so when we were getting ready to take over the program from
                    the Army (as it was then known) were very happy to have me go out and assume the
                    position of Executive Officer, USIS/Japan. It was my duty initially to manage
                    all logistics for the takeover from the Army of the CI&amp;E Program, with 24
                    field offices, 900 Japanese employees, a $7,000,000 to $8,000,000 Budget,
                    plus.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you certainly had the background for it. It must
                        have been a tremendous logistical problem providing the administrative needs
                        for a major cultural and information program in what was enemy
                        territory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The Early Preparations for Assuming Army'sInformation Program</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, it was. The Army had set up very extensive information and
                    education program in what they called the CI&amp;E or the Civil Information and
                    Education Program under the headquarters which was known as GHQ SCAP. General
                    Headquarters of the Supreme Command of the Allied Powers in Japan. They had 24
                    field offices of the program located all over Japan. Two of them were in Tokyo.
                    They were designated as libraries, though they also were conduits for cultural
                    programming. When the USIS took over, we changed the name to USIS Cultural
                    Centers. The Japanese have been intrigued always by the concept of culture, and
                    held suspicions about anything called “information.” That word to them (as in
                    Europe) was often synonymous with “Intelligence. So when we took over, we called
                    them cultural centers or bunka senta in the Japanese language, which were
                    libraries but also with an extensive program of cultural activities including
                    lectures and motion picture showings and all the paraphernalia that USIS
                    frequently employs or did employ then (and to a large extent still employs
                    today) in its centers abroad.</p>
                <p>There were over 900 Japanese employed by the CI&amp;E either in Tokyo or in the
                    various cultural centers around the country. Each one of the centers had at
                    least one vehicle as sort of a mobile unit which they could take out into the
                    boondocks and show movies. And they had, of course, substantial libraries of
                    anywhere from three to five thousand volumes each, plus, of course, all the
                    necessities of supporting a staff of that size. Each center was manned by at
                    least one American. Only one or two of them had more than one American. And the
                    rest were all Japanese employees.</p>
                <p>The task fell to me alone at first because I at that time was the only executive
                    officer there. I was all by myself in what was then the Diplomatic Section of
                    General Headquarters SCAP. Shortly thereafter, however, I was lent a young man
                    by the name of Joseph Womack who was a junior officer in the administrative
                    office of the embassy. He became my assistant and was with me for the next year
                    and a half. It was a great help to get him. He was very good. Next we soon began
                    to acquire a very excellent Japanese staff, as the official take over date
                    (April 29, 1952) approached.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>We screened every one of the 900 Japanese employees. We made a decision to close
                    the second center in Tokyo, so we eliminated the facilities that were there and
                    kept just the one main center in the central part of downtown Tokyo. Initially,
                    we kept all the other centers, and so eventually took on about 850 of the
                    Japanese who had been in the CI&amp;E operation. And believe me, screening 850
                    employees in the three months time was quite a job in itself. I should add that
                    the treaty was supposed to have become effective early in February. And I
                    arrived about the 21st or 22nd of January.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, because I don't think we could have achieved the takeover in that
                    short period of time, there were various reasons, which I don't need to
                    elucidate here, for the delay in putting the treaty into effect, and it did not
                    actually go into effect until the 29th of April. this gave me and Joe Brown who
                    was the Chief Administrative Officer for the CI&amp;E operation a chance to sort
                    things out. We were able to take advantage of a lot of the so-called GARIOA
                    funds, Government Affairs Resources in Occupied Areas.</p>
                <p>Although the Army didn't actually transfer this local currency to us which had
                    been available under the terms of our giving money to the defeated country and
                    their putting up bank accounts in Japanese yen for the equivalent amount, they
                    did at my request give us a great deal of purchasing power against the Army
                    budget while the Army was still in control. As a result of that help we were
                    able to expand our library collections, get a lot of more modernized equipment,
                    make considerable repairs or improvements at various centers and get them in
                    good shape before we actually took over.</p>
                <p>We also had to screen all the Japanese in the CI&amp;E central headquarters in
                    Tokyo. We did that and selected I would say more than two-thirds of them to come
                    over and work in the operation that soon became USIS in Tokyo.</p>
                <p>Another thing fell to our lot. Not knowing exactly how many people we would need
                    to handle an operation of this size, which, except for Germany, at that time was
                    by far the largest overseas operation IIA had overseas, Washington had set up
                    135 American positions for Tokyo. We wanted to hire quite a number of the people
                    who had been in similar positions in GHQ SCAP CI&amp;E operation, so we began
                    selecting them. I would say that we probably selected about two-thirds of the
                    Americans who were in positions there to come over to our operation. This
                    included a number of the people who were in cultural centers around the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Security Clearance Problems Handicap Takeover</p>
                <p>Every one of these people, of course, had cleared the security requirements of
                    the Army back in '45, '46 and '47 when they came aboard with the Army. But by
                    1952 Senator McCarthy ad begun his depredations on the American side.
                    Fortunately, just as an aside, we were never afflicted with Mr. Cohn and Mr.
                    Schine in the Orient. They preferred to dangle around Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, about half the requests that we sent in or the transfer of these
                    people from GHQ SCAP into our operation were turned down by Security. Security
                    had become highly sensitized by the McCarthy raids, and if there was anything
                    even remotely that might set off some accusation of “left-wingism” or immorality
                    by Security (SY) definition or whatever it might be, they turned them down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you undoubtedly lost a lot of good people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: We lost a lot of good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some that spoke Japanese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, unfortunately, we didn't have anybody in the motion picture area.
                    And we were about to embark on a rather large motion picture program, including
                    production. We had bought quite a lot of equipment and were ready to start
                    producing some of our own films. Security turned down the first two people
                    requested from the motion picture section of the Army operation that I wanted to
                    get. Finally they turned down the last one. I was really not only exhausted but
                    utterly turned off by the whole process. I knew this man, and I couldn't see how
                    in the world they could turn him down.</p>
                <p>So I persuaded Sax Bradford who was the head of USIS in Tokyo at that time to
                    send a telegram which I had drafted, and which I felt was rather important. Sax
                    was a bit skeptical at first, but I sent it anyway. [And he was pretty mad
                    himself.] So the cable read, “Your security turn down of George Gierke [the
                    third man in question] completes destruction of the USIS motion picture program
                    in Tokyo. If you can't find some way to send this man over to us, will you
                    please furnish someone of your own choosing?”</p>
                <p>The net result of that was that they did renege. They cleared Gierke. He arrived
                    late in 1952 and was our motion picture officer for the next two years until he
                    had to go back to the States for reasons of health.</p>
                <p>Well, on the famous day of April 29th we were at last in business. We had covered
                    or had filled I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 or 85 of the
                    authorized American positions. We never did reach the full 135. I'll get into
                    that later.</p>
                <p>Getting the Program Under Way as USIS</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And when you say the famous day the 29th you mean when the
                        treaty was signed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: That's when the treaty became effective. It had been signed the
                    preceding autumn in San Francisco. Up to that time the man who had the personal
                    rank of ambassador and was the head of what was then called the Diplomatic
                    Section of SCAP was Bill Sebald who himself was an old Japan hand. But because
                    this was to be a new era, the Department didn't want Sebald to stay on after the
                    Occupation had been terminated. So Washington sent out Robert Daniel (Bob)
                    Murphy.</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: DepState withdrew Sebald and sent out Robert Murphy as ambassador.
                    Murphy had made his reputation in the Foreign Service by being the man sent
                    ashore in advance of the allied invasion of North Africa in 1942 and early '43
                    and had negotiated the arrangements with the Vichy French Government
                    representatives there which facilitated the allied landings. [Murphy later wrote
                    a fascinating, and best selling, book about his experiences and activities on
                    this historic episode. It was titled Diplomat Among Warriors.] He was quite a
                    man and excellent diplomat although he himself didn't have any prior experience
                    in Japanese affairs. They sent Sebald out the night of April 28th. Murphy
                    arrived early in the morning by plane on the 29th and became our ambassador. We
                    went into business as business opened on the morning of the 29th as USIS
                    Japan.</p>
                <p>At that time as I say we had filled probably 80 to 85 of the 135 American
                    positions that were authorized. And we spread our own people out all over Japan.
                    Several of the people who had been heads of centers in various places around the
                    country during the Army program were still there. A number of them remained in
                    position for the next year to 15 months, some of them decided they had had it
                    and wanted to go back to the States. Whereupon we sent our own recruits, newly
                    arrived IIA personnel into the centers. Very few of them had had prior Japanese
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Building up a program from scratch was facilitated, of course by the fact that
                    the Army had done a superb job, but we wanted to put our imprint on it. We
                    wanted to start wide scale radio programming, a wide ranging motion picture
                    program, and to expand field programming generally.</p>
                <p>Most of the jeeps that the Army had been using for mobile units in the various
                    centers belonged to the GHQ SCAP. The Army took back most of those jeeps, when
                    USIS took over the Information program. We were faced with the necessity of
                    replacing the returned Army vehicle with our own.</p>
                <p>The Delahaye Monsters</p>
                <p>Replacement was another story. In Washington USIE (through DepState) controlled
                    large amounts of local currency in European countries. France had just gotten
                    its automotive industry back into operation, and were producing something called
                    a Delahaye, D-E-L-A-H-A-Y-E.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a van wasn't it? Or no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Pardon? It was a van. It was a very large cumbersome, extremely heavy
                    van. And, of course, there was no power steering in those days. About half of
                    our center directors in Japan were women, some of them quite frail. I had never
                    seen a Delahaye. I didn't know what the darned thing looked like. So I said,
                    fine, if we can get 20 of those sent out here as soon possible please send
                    them.</p>
                <p>Well, it took about five months before they began to arrive. When the first three
                    or four hit the pier in Yokohama, I went down to look at them and was appalled.
                    I didn't know how in the world some of the women who were supposed to operate
                    these things were ever going to be able to control them. One of the funniest
                    pictures I remember is a little woman who at that time was our center director
                    up in the Japanese city of Niigata on the north coast of Japan. She was about
                    five feet tall. I don't think she weighed more than 95 or 100 pounds soaking
                    wet. And to see her behind the wheel of this Delahaye trying to wrestle that
                    non-power steering mastodon around was really something.</p>
                <p>Also, their speedometers were all calibrated in kilometers. We were supposed to
                    report our mileage in miles. That posed another small administrative problem.
                    But we did operate for, I would say, nearly two years with these Delahayes.</p>
                <p>In addition to that fact, they were the first products off the French assembly
                    line when they began manufacturing. They weren't too well put together, and they
                    began breaking down very rapidly. There were no facilities in Japan to repair
                    Delahayes—and worse, no parts! I fact, there weren't any facilities to fix much
                    of anything in Japan at that time except those operated by the military. So we
                    had our troubles. Eventually over a period of my nearly 4-1/2 years out there we
                    replaced all of them. But for the first year and a half or two years we had to
                    operate mostly with these monstrosities and then finally junked them. There was
                    no market for them once we were ready to get rid of them.</p>
                <p>As I've said before the motion picture program was the hardest to get underway
                    because it took more than seven months from the time we started operation until
                    George Gierke got out to Japan. Therefore, we started rather slowly. However,
                    George did produce some excellent movies. One of them particularly, called “The
                    Arts of Japan” which was premiered in one of the major theaters in Tokyo in the
                    Fall of 1954 was a masterpiece. It received accolades throughout the USIA
                    program in many parts of the world. It was in its time a remarkably sensitive
                    movie which was a tremendous hit in Japan. USIA in Washington thought it was
                    great, and gave all sorts of compliments to George for his success.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>He produced a number of other films. But I think that one was the jewel in his
                    crown. He was subsequently diagnosed as having throat cancer and had to come
                    back to Washington. He was replaced in Tokyo by Harry Keith. Harry, who came out
                    on 1953, was really a genius at producing documentary films. I'll talk a little
                    bit more about him later on. But he did an excellent job. Some of the best
                    agency films produced during those years were put out by Harry Keith in Tokyo.
                    Japan had developed a fine mopix capability in pre-War years. Largely under the
                    tutelage of Army personnel, it was, by 1952, recovering well. Thus USIS could
                    produce films on contract without having to build its own production facilities.
                    We were especially fortunate because with Army assistance during Occupation
                    years, Japan had developed excellent color processing capabilities in Tokyo.
                    Keith devised and directed, using Japanese talent and production equipment.</p>
                <p>We were also blessed by the fact that just as we were taking over from CI&amp;E,
                    Germany was winding down its immense HICOG operation. As the German operation
                    phased down, a number of fine officers became available to fill our crying needs
                    in Japan. Even though they did not have Japan expertise, they had obtained
                    excellent grassroots informational and educational experience in their various
                    roles in the German occupation and knew what they were doing.</p>
                <p>One of the best of these was a remarkably talented woman by the name of Patricia
                    van Delden. Pat often raised hackles among male officers, particularly her
                    superiors, because she was smarter than most of them, and she was an absolute
                    fountain of extremely good ideas, some of which weren't necessarily endorsed by
                    higher ups when they were first suggested. But Pat was so good at logical
                    argument that she usually persuaded her superiors (occasionally against their
                    will) to put her ideas into effect. This didn't necessarily endear her to her
                    superiors, who felt that she was rather a pushy woman and perhaps was exceeding
                    the bounds of her “proper place” in USIS. One of those who especially came to
                    feel that way was USIS Director Sax Bradford—but more of that later.</p>
                <p>However, we made her the supervisor of the field program which put her in charge
                    directly of all the remaining 23 centers in Japan. I might add also that with so
                    many Centers, we decided there ought to be a regional office in Kobe, where
                    there was also a Consulate General, a regional office for the Tokyo area, and a
                    regional office for Kyushu.</p>
                <p>Since we only had one center in Sapporo on the Island of Hokkaido, we felt we
                    didn't need a regional officer there and handled that center out of Tokyo. Of
                    the three regional officers that we had, one was an old Japan hand, Walter
                    Nichols, who had been born in Japan, had grown up there until he was about 14 or
                    15 and spoke Japanese quite fluently. Walt was designated the Kobe regional
                    officer. He had the largest number of centers under his general jurisdiction but
                    was also operating under the supervision of Pat van Delden. I must say I have
                    forgotten the names of officers were who were in charge elsewhere. I suppose if
                    I had tried hard enough and tried to look up their names I might remember. But
                    at the moment I do not.</p>

                <p>The Nagano Seminar</p>
                <p>Well, I said earlier that Pat van Delden was a virtual fountain of ideas. Since I
                    am speaking about her here, I will at this point discuss one of her most
                    successful ones, even though it developed in 1953, and thus is a bit out of
                    sequence here in the discussion of what constituted the formative stage of
                    USIS/Tokyo. This was the highly popular and effective summer program that came
                    to be known and recognized throughout a good part of academic Japan as The
                    Nagano Seminar. Although a few others of us assisted in developing the final
                    venue and format, Pat conceived the idea of staging a seminar on American
                    literature in some quiet, smaller city of Japan, away from the distractions of
                    Tokyo. We would select a manageable number (28 was decided for the first summer,
                    and 32 thereafter) of top Japanese professors of English and American
                    literature, support them for a full four weeks of study and discussion under the
                    guidance of American professors of literature, and generally exchange ideas with
                    them on a wide range of subjects both during, and informally after, seminar
                    sessions.</p>
                <p>We selected the charming and historic cultural city of Nagano located about 100
                    miles northwest of Tokyo in a softly beautiful setting at the foot of the Japan
                    Alps, which includes near its (then) northern outskirts one of Japan's lovelier
                    and more spacious Buddhist temples. From the USIS/Japan budget, we paid the
                    participant's complete board and lodging for a month in Nagano's two top class
                    Japanese ryokan—in those times, not an overly expensive undertaking. Applicants
                    for the limited slots greatly exceeded the number of openings USIS could
                    offer.</p>
                <p>In the first year, we relied on competent American professors who were teaching
                    American literature in Japanese universities to be moderators or discussion
                    leaders, since it was too late in the spring to obtain name persons from the
                    U.S. through the Exchange of Persons program. We brought the moderators and the
                    professors to Nagano at the beginning of August. I took two or three of our
                    administrative office Japanese employees up a few days ahead of the opening, and
                    went up myself to handle the logistics of getting the program under way. The
                    Japanese stayed throughout most of the seminar.</p>
                <p>In the years after 1953, the Exchange of Persons office in Washington furnished
                    name figures of American literature to perform as discussion leaders at the
                    seminar. The most famous of these was William Faulkner, whose participation in
                    1955 made headlines all over Japan, and whose visit provided one of the most
                    memorable set of events in my career. But that is a story for later in this
                    interview.</p>
                <p>The seminar paid off handsomely in the spreading influence the professors exerted
                    on their students and the publicity the program gave to the American academic
                    reputation. Unfortunately, USIA's 1957 budget disaster occasioned by the
                    animosity of then Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson for newly nominated USIA
                    Director Arthur Larson so curtailed Agency funding that the seminar was dropped,
                    and has never been reinstituted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a motion picture made about his visit also,
                        wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, there was a motion picture. USIS made a film up there which was
                    produced by Harry Keith, named, as I recall, “William Faulkner in Japan.” It was
                    a great hit and was extremely successful in our Japan motion picture program
                    later on.</p>
                <p>I will talk a little bit more later about Mr. Faulkner's visit which had a number
                    of interesting and often disturbing sidelights. I want to go back now to an
                    earlier period and talk about the development of the Information and Education
                    program in Japan after it became a USIS operation. Let's pause for just a minute
                    at this point.</p>
                <p>A New Cultural Center Building: “The Manchurian Candidate”</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: I went ahead of our USIS program story in Japan because I wanted to say
                    a few words about Pat van Delden and about some of the other people who
                    participated in building what I thought was one of the finest programs with
                    which I've ever been associated.</p>
                <p>So now let's resume near the beginning. One of the developments that provided our
                    first small crisis in the program was that our Tokyo cultural center, located
                    right in the heart of downtown Tokyo just off the Ginza was about to be
                    reclaimed by the Japanese. As soon as the Occupation was over the Japanese began
                    to pick up a little courage, and to express their desires as an independent
                    country which is not only natural but I think desirable. And they wanted our
                    center building.</p>
                <p>So we were faced with the necessity of finding a new location. Tokyo had been to
                    some extent rebuilt. But it was still a partially ravaged city even in 1952.
                    Vacant spaces for the type of operation that we needed was not readily
                    available.</p>
                <p>So our Director, Sax Bradford, went to see the Foreign Ministry to determine what
                    kind of help they could give us in finding a location that would be an adequate
                    substitute. They had their troubles. I don't know whether the building that they
                    finally came up with as a suggestion belonged to the Foreign Ministry or whether
                    it belonged to the Mombusho, the Ministry of Education.</p>
                <p>Anyway, they said we could have this building providing that we would
                    rehabilitate it, that it was in bad repair because nothing had been done with it
                    through the whole period of the war and even the occupation. One favorable thing
                    about it, it was over in the Kanda district of Tokyo which is not far from Tokyo
                    University. It's also near the location of many art and book stores, frequented
                    extensively by student populations which we were trying to reach and many of
                    whom were radically inclined. So we thought that would be a good location.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Well, Sax went over to look at it and discovered that the whole thing was
                    occupied by I don't know how many—we never did count them—but a substantially
                    large number of students from Manchukuo. The Foreign Office was appalled. They
                    didn't know these students were still in Japan— especially in Tokyo. The
                    Japanese Government brought them over in the period shortly before and during
                    the early part of the war as exchange students under the Japanese exchange
                    program. I don't know how many people will remember that Manchuria had been
                    taken over by the Japanese Army in 1931-32. The Japanese civilian government
                    shortly thereafter broke it off from China, set it up as a puppet state of
                    Manchukuo.</p>
                <p>The Japanese were interested in getting as many as they could of the university
                    students over from Manchukuo to be educated in Japan. Rather large numbers were
                    brought over, and many of them were housed in this building which the Foreign
                    Ministry had just told us now after many years of use that we could have. The
                    situation soon turned into a comedy. There were at least a score of ex-students
                    there. As I say, we never counted them. But there were at least a score of them.
                    Most of them had either married or at least were cohabiting with Japanese women
                    or with Manchurian women students who had come over. And here they were after
                    five years of war and 6-1/2 or seven years of Occupation, still living in the
                    place unbeknownst to the Foreign Ministry and/or the Ministry of Education, both
                    of which were embarrassed to find out that they were still in this building.
                    What was even more unnerving was that this group was at the heart of one of
                    Tokyo's black market operations.</p>
                <p>We were disgusted at the appearance of the building which would have cost so much
                    to rehabilitate that we decided against using it. I never did find out what
                    happened to the long occupying Manchurian students, presumably the Ministries
                    found some way to clear them out and perhaps sent them back to Manchuria. But
                    that's the last we heard of them.</p>
                <p>May Day! May Day!</p>
                <p>Shortly before the center search episode I just spoke about, Tokyo, and all
                    Americans then living there, experienced something that few if any of us had
                    anticipated. It was just three days after the Peace Treaty went into effect—May
                    Day, 1952. The MacArthur Occupation had, among other things, made a point of
                    writing a new law code governing labor, and allowing the unions the sort of
                    freedom they had never enjoyed under the former Imperial Government. The new
                    freedom had allowed a fairly substantial infiltration of communists into the
                    labor unions, and the majority of the union membership were at least partly
                    leftist in orientation.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Each May 1, since the Occupation began, the unions had been staging May Day
                    parades and celebrations. I am not sure what the Japanese Government expected
                    for this first May Day outside the restricting confines of the Occupation.
                    Probably more militancy than had been in evidence before the Treaty freed up the
                    country, but also probably not what erupted. When the parade began, I wasn't up
                    on the roof of our building, the Mitsubishi Shoji Building near the Imperial
                    Palace moat, and in the heart of Tokyo. The first I knew of the mounting riot,
                    was when one of our officers came into my office and told me I had better get up
                    on the roof to see the rioting.</p>
                <p>It was frightening. None of my past experiences in Japan had prepared me for
                    seeing the Japanese perform like that. The police were clearly unprepared. If
                    there had been any semblance of a parade to begin with, it was out of hand by
                    that time. Mobs were running about with no apparent destination in mind,
                    carrying (obviously inflammatory) banners attacking anyone or anything they
                    could see for no apparent reason. The police were outmanned, but doing the best
                    they could to beat back attacks either against themselves or hapless bystanders.
                    Fires were being set. Automobiles overturned. The mob grew in violence and
                    numbers as the afternoon wore on. By around 3:30 p.m. there was a sea of
                    humanity roiling all along the moat and onto the outer plaza leading to the
                    entrance to the Imperial Palace.</p>
                <p>Our then Cultural Attach�, Margaret Williams, I learned later, had decided when
                    the rioting seemed to be building, that she had better get home while flight was
                    still possible. That proved to be a mistake. Her driver thought he could get
                    through the mobs by detouring off the main streets through the narrower passages
                    in the downtown theater district. By the time they reached that street, parts of
                    new mobs were coming down toward them from the opposite direction. The crowd
                    suddenly attacked Margaret's car with stones and long wooden poles, pulverizing,
                    but fortunately not shattering, windshield and car windows, and extensively
                    denting the car. By some miracle, perhaps police arrival, they finally managed
                    to get through and tore home. Several other Americans had similar experiences,
                    and suffered extensive car damage. There were no severe American casualties, but
                    this sudden explosion of violence toward Americans who had never experienced
                    much but gratitude from the local citizens, really shook up the resident
                    Yankees. It sure shook me. Ultimately the riots were quieted, but it was a long
                    time before a lot of us could feel the same sense of friendliness and security
                    we had known earlier.</p>
                <p>A Subtle Coolness Between Our USIS Director and Myself</p>
                <p>It was not long after my arrival in January of 1952 that I began to sense a cool
                    aloofness in Sax Bradford's attitude toward me. There was no overt hostility,
                    simply an attitude of superiority and almost condescension. I began to feel that
                    he considered anyone in an administrative assignment as somehow less intelligent
                    or intellectual than officers holding other, substantive positions.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Later developments and incidents, which I'll mention at the appropriate points in
                    this interview confirmed my suspicion, but one small episode reinforced my
                    belief early on that I was correct. At a small informal social gathering we both
                    attended one evening, he began a conversation with me, and a few minutes later,
                    rather abruptly without any seeming relationship to what we had been discussing,
                    began to tell me about a time a few years earlier when he was heading a
                    delegation to some conference in Mexico City. A State Department administrative
                    officer had been assigned to the delegation to handle logistics and finances.
                    Sax had ordered this officer to pay a rather substantial amount of money for
                    something, the nature of which I have forgotten. Anyway, the officer argued with
                    Sax that the expenditure was a violation of both Departmental regulations and
                    Federal appropriation language, and he couldn't legally pay it. Sax insisted,
                    and according to him, the officer became very emotional about it. As a result,
                    Sax sent a rough telegram to Washington. The officer was recalled and presumably
                    reprimanded. The incident was told clearly to illustrate the single minded
                    blindness of the administrative type to matters of higher importance.</p>
                <p>Although I never mentioned the fact to Sax, it happened that the man in the story
                    had been a classmate of mine at the Harvard Littauer Graduate School some
                    thirteen years earlier. I recalled that he had suddenly left Government about
                    the time Sax was describing. I had thought it strange then, because he already
                    had 15 years invested in Government service, and so far as I knew, hadn't any
                    intention of resigning. He returned to his hometown of Denver. Later, I learned
                    that he had had a nervous breakdown, but recovered. It may not, of course, have
                    had any relation to the incident described by Sax, but again, it might.</p>
                <p>Not too long after that, another USIS officer brought me a copy of a memo written
                    by our Cultural Attach�, Margaret Williams, to Sax. I don't know how he got it,
                    but the subject was interesting. She was complaining to Sax that “Our Executive
                    Officer” was assuming excessive responsibilities in the area of program
                    priorities and resource allocations, and wondering if it was right for an
                    administrative type to “meddle” so deeply in substantive matters.</p>
                <p>There were, of course, grounds for her contention that I was deeply into program.
                    I had been at first surprised, and later disturbed that Sax seemed to be little
                    concerned with the details of USIS program operation. He had set up his office
                    over in the chancery. In the early days of USIS operation, all of USIS except
                    Sax and his secretary were in the Mitsubishi Shoji Building which was more than
                    two miles away on the edge of the financial district near Tokyo Station. Later,
                    USIS, again except for Sax, moved to what was designated the Embassy Annex, the
                    Mantetsu Building, about two blocks from the main Embassy building. If I hadn't
                    been living in the same embassy residential compound, I would have seen him only
                    infrequently. He almost never came down to USIS offices and staff meetings were
                    not regularly held.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The date for our assumption of the Army's CI&amp;E program was getting closer.
                    Our budget and program responsibilities were about to take a quantum leap. Sax
                    seemed utterly complacent. In the absence of any direction, I began drawing up
                    organizational and staffing plans, as well as proposed resource allocation by
                    program unit. At our occasional staff meetings, I would present these proposals.
                    Sax seemed to accept them without question. Having been accustomed in Washington
                    to considerable program officer participation in budgetary allocations and other
                    administrative decisions, I found this attitude strange. As spring and summer
                    progressed, I began more and more to consult directly with newly arriving and
                    already on duty unit heads concerning their program plans and resource needs,
                    and making advance budgetary allocations accordingly. At staff meetings I told
                    Sax what I was doing and received his OK, but no comment. As a result, before
                    long, all the officers except Margaret Williams were coming directly to me to
                    discuss their plans and requirements.</p>
                <p>An even more peculiar and upsetting development took place during the summer of
                    1952. Washington sent out a request to draw up a complete detailed program plan
                    of operations, together with cost tags attached, descriptions of goals, and
                    methods of reaching them. This was far more than the standard budget document of
                    those days. It was what I suppose was the forerunner of the country plan and
                    management by objectives approach that was used in later years, and was to apply
                    to our newly born USIS operation in Fiscal Year 1953. It seemed to me that it
                    was a document that screamed for PAO participation. Sax treated it as something
                    beneath him that he should sign when the peons had finished it. By this time Pat
                    van Delden was aboard. She and I took the initiative, consulted all the program
                    heads, and undertook to write an extensive plan that ultimately ran to over 100
                    single spaced typewritten pages.</p>
                <p>When we had it in final draft, I sent it to Sax for his OK. He read and signed
                    it, sending it to Washington without change. A few days later when I met him in
                    the chancery, he said to me: “Those guys did a pretty good job on the program
                    paper, didn't they?” I had planned and written almost the entire document. There
                    was no recognition on his part that I had had any part in it. It's an
                    understatement to say that I was let down.</p>
                <p>The Radio Operation in Early USIS/Japan and its Later Development</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier that you would discuss some other
                        parts of the USIS effort getting under way in the early days of
                        USIS/Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, now, I want to get back to some of the other program activities
                    that were under way in spring and summer of 1952. Particularly, let me talk a
                    bit about the radio program. One of the few men from CI&amp;E not disqualified
                    by Security was Bill Meredith from their radio shop. He transferred to us
                    immediately after April 29, 1952, as did all the Japanese employees whom, during
                    the late winter months, we had already screened and decided to hire from the
                    CI&amp;E. Meredith was a capable man, but not overly energetic. We needed more
                    spark.</p>
                <p>A couple years before, Sax had met Henry (Hank) Gosho, who had worked on some
                    projects for VOA in New York. Hank was unique. He was an American Nisei, whose
                    father had sent him to Japan at pre-high school age to be educated in Japan.
                    Hank went through middle and higher school there, and the first year or so of
                    college. Seeing the probability of oncoming war, his father brought him back to
                    the States on one o the last ships coming to America before Pearl Harbor. Hank's
                    Japanese schooling had made him bilingual in Japanese-probably the only American
                    in the Information program with that qualification. He also had acquired
                    extensive radio experience. however, because his wife was not yet an American
                    citizen, she couldn't accompany Hank to Japan, and Hank wouldn't take a regular
                    assignment without her. Sax arranged for him to come on a six month TDY, and he
                    provided the spark that got the USIS Radio program going. (His wife, Jeanne,
                    finally got U.S. citizenship, and Hank later returned for a regular assignment
                    that lasted several years.)</p>
                <p>At the time the Peace Treaty became effective, and for some years thereafter,
                    Japan had no national radio network. I don't know exactly how many stations
                    there were then, but I would guess there may well have been 200 or more in
                    various cities and towns around Japan. Most of them had a very weak signal—not
                    more than 15 or 20 watts. Only a few had even 100 watts, and I doubt if any were
                    as powerful as 500 or 1,000 though I'm not sure. Their low power severely
                    limited their range, so stations could proliferate without interfering with one
                    another's frequencies. They wanted to broadcast several hours a day, but had
                    little capacity to produce programs, and so were frantic for material to fill
                    broadcast time. This gave USIS a tremendous opportunity.</p>
                <p>Under Hank's planning, he and a couple Japanese employees traveled frequently
                    around the country, establishing a large and enduring clientele of radio outlets
                    delighted to use USIS taped material. The response was enthusiastic. USIS began
                    an operation that eventually (when we acquired enough tape dubbing machines to
                    satisfy the demand) saturated the Japanese airwaves. I don't want to describe
                    this work in detail. Hank himself will be interviewed and give a thorough
                    explanation of what USIS accomplished. It is enough here to say that this sort
                    of saturation went on for several years, until the Japanese finally got back
                    into network coverage. Then the USIS role wound down and terminated.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Toward the end of my first year in Japan, Bill Meredith went home, and was
                    replaced by Victor (Vic) Hauge. In late 1953 or early '54, Hank came back for a
                    regular tour, worked closely with Hauge during Vic's years, and remained for
                    some years after Vic's return to Washington. The Radio effort at its peak
                    demanded an ever increasing amount of USIS resources. Besides, we were being cut
                    back from our early affluence. When we first took over from CI&amp;E, our annual
                    budget was something like $7,000,000 or $8,000,000, which was a tremendous
                    budget in the early '50s, though not so much these days. Earlier, we had been
                    pretty well able to fund almost anything that we wanted to do. But we were
                    beginning to get progressively restricted, and even though we were by that time
                    closing many centers, [a situation I'll discuss later] we still were running
                    rather tight on money.</p>
                <p>I managed however to reprogram things enough as we gradually closed centers so
                    that I could give more money to the radio operation. Vic Hauge performed
                    wonderfully. We had probably an average of two or three hours and sometimes more
                    a day on almost every radio station in Japan for a period of several years. A
                    large amount of it was music. I think for better or for worse we probably played
                    a fairly large role in indoctrinating the Japanese on American popular music.
                    But in any event there were other programs that carried more program freight
                    than that. The fact that we had this opportunity was heaven sent. Vic and Hank
                    did a tremendous job in satisfying their requirements and getting programs on
                    the air for the Japanese at a time when every radio station was receptive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had the staff and facilities to carry it out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yeah, we had a large radio staff. We had three or four Americans. And
                    Hank was a godsend at a most critical stage. He had incidentally served in the
                    China Burma India theater with the Army and had therefore been rehabilitated as
                    an American citizen. Well, actually I don't think he had to be. Because he went
                    back from Japan—went back to the States just before Pearl Harbor, and therefore
                    was not in Japan like many of the other Nisei who temporarily lost their
                    citizenship because they were in Japan during the war and naturally worked for
                    the Japanese war industry, the only way they could survive.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>He came with a tremendous amount of experience. He knew Japan intimately. He knew
                    radio, perhaps even better than Vic Hauge did. He had this bilingual capability
                    in Japanese, was a superb negotiator with the Japan radio stations. Could always
                    deal with them as if he were a native. We also had superb, highly intelligent
                    staff, not only among the Japanese who were highly skilled, but among our two or
                    three top Americans, in the radio section. We were also without the sort of
                    competition that would have made such success impossible. At that time
                    television had not started. It was just beginning to come into Japan when I left
                    in 1956. I don't think there was more than one station in Japan and it broadcast
                    a very limited amount of time. There probably weren't more than 100 receivers in
                    the whole country. None of them were owned by individuals. They were all in the
                    hands of restaurants or businesses or something of that sort. And people, of
                    course, were getting very excited about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And before you left in 1956 weren't you acting country
                        public affairs director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: No, I had been acting before that. And I'll come to that shortly. But by
                    the time I left in May, 1956, Joe Evans had come to be PAO, and Art Hummel had
                    come out to be deputy PAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Art Hummel who later became ambassador to Pakistan and
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: That's right. As well as to Burma and Ethiopia. He was Assistant
                    Secretary of State for Far East for a while. Since you've asked the question,
                    however, I'll go ahead and discuss that part of my Japan experience now,
                    although it involves jumping ahead in sequence nearly three years. Sax Bradford
                    had been named to a new, powerful position in Washington in late 1953. His
                    replacement was Willard Hannah, who in mid-year 1954 resigned. Ken Bunce had
                    been named Acting Director when I was on home leave in the summer of 1954, and
                    Willard Hannah resigned. Ken remained in that capacity through the balance of
                    '54 into the early spring of 1955, when he came to the end of his tour. By then
                    he had spent so much of his career in Japan he felt he didn't want to return,
                    and he went back to the States. He later became PAO in India and never did
                    return to Japan in an official capacity.</p>
                <p>Schmidt Becomes Acting PAO/Japan: Spring and Summer, 1955</p>
                <p>I became Acting Director at that time, and was Acting from either April or May,
                    whichever it was, I think late April, until Joe Evans and Art Hummel arrived in
                    October. Several rather significant events occurred during my short stay on the
                    “throne.”</p>
                <p>Staging the Atoms for Peace Exhibit</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I'll come back a little later to the William Faulkner visit to Japan which in
                    time preceded the exhibit. Commercial Atomic Energy was just coming into
                    existence. There was only one functional reactor in the world then, the one at
                    Shippingport. The Eisenhower Administration wanted to make the world aware of
                    this great new power source and America's leading role in its development. I
                    believe our exhibit in Japan was the first ever undertaken by USIS. By the time
                    the exhibit opened in November, Joe Evans and Art Hummel had already arrived,
                    but the staging period all took place during my brief reign. Frances Blakemore,
                    who was our USIS artist, a very creative and imaginative woman, was the chief
                    force in planning the entire show, although ably assisted by a skilled Japanese
                    staff and “Tom” Tuch who came out on TDY from the Agency's Exhibits Office. Tom
                    had been in on the ground floor of the Washington planning for these shows, and
                    was a great help.</p>
                <p>Atomic energy was such a brand new means of power that people could really not
                    comprehend its potential nor all the dangers of atomic generation of
                    electricity.</p>
                <p>The Japanese were fascinated, but they were also scared of atomic energy anywhere
                    except—or maybe even—in a reactor. However, at that time they thought it might
                    be a good solution to some of their own power problems. They were hungry for
                    information about it.</p>
                <p>A man by the name of Shoriki, who was one of the principal developers of and then
                    editor of the newspaper Yomiuri, which had under his direction become one of the
                    two most powerful papers in Japan, wanted more than anything else to be the
                    first head of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                <p>Realizing this, our information section prevailed upon him and his paper to
                    sponsor the exhibit. He enthusiastically agreed and saved USIS tremendous
                    expense. Yomiuri owned or controlled a large auditorium which Shoriki placed at
                    USIS disposal to house the show. He also put a lot of money into it, furnishing
                    much labor and material. Of course Shoriki was present at the exhibit opening,
                    and got all sorts of accolades for having sponsored it. He later did become the
                    first director of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
                <p>My first meeting with “Tom” Tuch took place at that time. Tom was then a young
                    junior officer in USIA. He was working in the exhibit section in USIA in
                    Washington. He came out on TDY, and was extremely helpful, because he had a lot
                    of information about what Washington wanted to get across by means of the
                    exhibit, and stayed for about two months until we got the exhibit well mounted.
                    Then he returned to Washington. I don't believe he was there when the exhibit
                    actually opened, though my memory is not clear on this point. But he was there
                    for a good part of the summer while it was being put together and was highly
                    instrumental in its successful conclusion.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>So Shoriki realized his ambition to be the first director of the atomic energy
                    commission in Japan. The exhibit was a tremendous success. It stayed open
                    somewhat longer than had originally been planned because it was so popular. I
                    don't know how many thousands of people went through it. When Joe Evans and Art
                    Hummel arrived in late October, I, of course, returned to my official position
                    as Executive Officer and turned the program back over to them. I remained until
                    the spring of 1956 at which time I was transferred to Brazil. Before I leave
                    this discussion of my short period as Acting PAO, Japan, I would like to speak
                    briefly about two other events which occurred which I think were really three
                    which were very instrumental in making the Japan programs a success in those
                    early years and which also gained certain degree of notoriety with a bit of
                    humor and dismay on occasion.</p>
                <p>The “Famous Faulkner” Visit to Japan</p>
                <p>The one was the visit of William Faulkner as the person who was sent out from
                    Washington under the exchange of persons program in 1955 to be the moderator of
                    the Nagano Seminar. We had 32 Japanese professors of English at that meeting.
                    The competition for participation in that year's session because of Faulkner was
                    tremendous. He had won the Nobel Prize a few years before and was a legend in
                    Japan among those who knew anything about literature. His coming was highly
                    heralded.</p>
                <p>I'll not go into all the details of Mr. Faulkner's visit. But nobody in
                    Washington had told us that he had trouble with alcoholism. When he arrived and
                    got off the plane after a 22 hour flight from the States, he obviously was under
                    the weather. I was in Nagano handling the first stages of logistics and setting
                    up the arrangements for registering all the professors and getting the seminar
                    ready to operate, taking care of the hotel facilities and what not. I got a call
                    from Tokyo saying, well, you better come back. Mr. Faulkner is here and there
                    are some problems.</p>
                <p>So I left Nagano and got back to my office the next day. Leon Picon who was our
                    book translation officer and assistant cultural attach� had been designated as
                    the man to meet Faulkner. Leon was going to be the resident American from the
                    embassy at the seminar in Nagano because of the fact that he was deep into the
                    book program.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Well, Leon was pretty resourceful. He, of course, had come out in an embassy car.
                    When he got Faulkner off the plane and realized his condition, he managed to get
                    Faulkner back to the International House, which a few years earlier had been
                    established under Rockefeller Foundation auspices. John D. Rockefeller III had
                    made sort of a career of charities and ran the Rockefeller Foundation. He was a
                    Far Eastern specialist himself, had given a large grant of money to the Japanese
                    government and the Japanese cultural operations to set up this International
                    House, which still exists and is an extremely important part of the cultural and
                    exchange program with America today. It is completely independent of the
                    embassy, but the PAO sits on the board of that center while he's active in
                    Tokyo, and for years it housed the Japan Fulbright Commission offices. The House
                    has hotel like facilities for visiting cultural personages staging cultural
                    conferences, providing study space for visiting scholars, etc. It's sort of an
                    exclusive hotel arrangement. They even have their own dining room.</p>
                <p>Leon got into a conversation with Faulkner who, despite the fact that he was
                    quite inebriated, handled his liquor fairly well. He was just a charming person,
                    a real southern gentleman, polite, gracious, absolutely a delightful individual.
                    But, of course, somewhat slurred in his perceptions when he was having this
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>He finally confided in Leon, who had a great capacity to establish rapport with
                    people quite quickly. On the way in to the International House he virtually
                    broke down and almost tearfully said that he did have a problem with alcohol.
                    And he was going to rely on Leon to keep him at least relatively sober so he
                    wouldn't disgrace himself. So Leon said, okay. By this time they were on the
                    Leon and Bill basis. He said, why don't you, Bill—Faulkner is Bill—why don't you
                    let me have any liquor you've got with you? He said, I'll do that. When they got
                    to the International House he opened a suitcase which was full of bottles of
                    gin, and gave all the visible bottles to Leon who took them away and sort of
                    tucked him in for the night. Leon said, well, we've got a program starting at
                    9:30 when you have an appointment tomorrow morning with the ambassador. I'll
                    come by and pick you up about nine o'clock or a little before in the morning.
                    See you then. He then took off with his armload of gin bottles.</p>
                <p>Leon went back to pick Faulkner up the next morning. And Faulkner had obviously
                    secreted some liquor elsewhere in his luggage, because he was once more pretty
                    well under the influence and was stark naked, wandering around the halls of the
                    International House in the all together. Leon got him back in his room and they
                    got him dressed. Leon phoned me. By this time I was over in the ambassador's
                    office waiting for them to arrive. I think the appointment was actually at ten
                    o'clock. This was about 9:30. And he called me in the ambassador's office and
                    said that he was having a little trouble, but don't worry. They would get
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Faulkner and he arrived about fifteen minutes later. The International House is
                    not that far from the embassy. Faulkner had sobered up a little bit but not all
                    that much, and he plunked down in a great big overstuffed chair, not very
                    communicative. The ambassador's number two secretary, a young girl who was in
                    her first overseas post came over and said, very awed at having Mr. Faulkner, a
                    Nobel Prize winner there, and said, “Mr. Faulkner, can I get you a drink?” And
                    he said, “Yes.” And she said, “What would you like? Water?” He said,
                    mischievously, “No. Gin.” The poor girl was completely nonplused. She retreated
                    in confusion, but did bring him a glass of water.</p>
                <p>At about that time the ambassador showed up at his outer door and said that,
                    okay, come in, Mr. Faulkner. Bill couldn't get out of the chair. So Leon and I
                    hoisted him out and each one got under an armpit. We guided him into the
                    ambassador's office and sat him down. The interview proved to be a disaster. The
                    ambassador didn't immediately recognize that he was almost incommunicado. And he
                    began directing a few questions at him to start the conversation. Faulkner's
                    responses were at least uncommunicative, usually about two or three words or yes
                    or no or something like that. And it soon because obvious that he wasn't going
                    to be able to make a successful interview at all. I could see the ambassador
                    getting very fidgety.</p>
                <p>So I finally said after about ten minutes, “Well, Mr. Ambassador, we thank you
                    very much for your interview. We'll leave now because we don't want to take up
                    more of your time. And we'll see you this afternoon.” [The Ambassador had agreed
                    to give a party for him at the residence to which we had invited quite a large
                    number of the American press, some of the cultural big wigs of the Japanese
                    government and some from the universities.] So again, Leon and I hoisted him out
                    of the room and we got him over to the Embassy annex where the USIS offices were
                    and into the office of Don Ranard, the head of the Exchange of Persons
                    Program.</p>
                <p>Well, Bill was supposed to speak to the foreign press club at 12:30 that day and
                    didn't look like he was going to make it. Leon and I stayed with him trying to
                    get him sobered up in the meantime. However, I wasn't sure he was going to make
                    it at all. He kept passing out. So I got hold of my wife by phone. She was a
                    nurse. She came over with a lot of antidotes for fainting and that sort of thing
                    plus our air mattress which we blew up and put down on the floor and got Bill
                    stretched out on the mattress.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Leon went down to the press club and tried to pacify the press. As
                    12:30 approached, when he was supposed to speak, everybody wanted to know where
                    Faulkner was. Leon kept phoning back reporting on the situation, and we kept
                    reporting to him that we weren't sure Faulkner was going to get there. But
                    Faulkner kept saying, yes, I'll do it. So we told Leon well, maybe we'll get him
                    down there but we'll be a little late.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Finally about 12:30 when he was due at the press club he sat up straight on the
                    mattress, but promptly threw up all over himself and all over the floor. And
                    that immediately, of course meant he wasn't going to get to the Press Club. So I
                    got hold of Leon who had the outline of remarks that he had made for Faulkner to
                    speak from. Faulkner was terrified of speaking anyway. He hated public speaking.
                    And Leon had to give a talk.</p>
                <p>The Press Club audience was infuriated. There was an article that appeared in
                    Time magazine the next week, next issue, saying that Faulkner had chickened out
                    and come inebriated to Tokyo and hadn't been able to perform. And that while the
                    press club was filled with people who'd come in from all over the Far East to
                    listen to him, Faulkner “was bedded down with a nurse somewhere in Tokyo” which
                    was, I guess, literally true, but not the implication that they meant, my wife
                    being the nurse.</p>
                <p>So anyway, we had to take him up to our apartment in the Embassy compound. Leon
                    went up and got a fresh set of clothes for him up at the International House. We
                    got him in the shower, washed him off, put him to bed for an hour or so. Then
                    got him up around 4:00 p.m. He got dressed in his fresh clothes and really had
                    come out of it pretty well by that time. We had a lovely conversation with him.
                    Wonderful guy when he was sober. My children came in, met him and got his
                    autograph. He was gentle, gracious, kind.</p>
                <p>We got him up to the Ambassador's in time for the reception, around 6:30. I told
                    the waiters up there, “Now, don't give him anything alcoholic to drink.” I had
                    no sooner gotten him into the receiving line—(Tape runs out)</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, as I was about to say, the waiter handed him every tall and strong
                    gin and tonic. I glared at him but I didn't want to make an issue because the
                    guests were already coming in, I made signs not to give him any more. But
                    Faulkner began bowing over the hand of every woman who came in and bowing very
                    low in his southern fashion and kissing her hand. About that time another waiter
                    brought in another gin and tonic. I watched Bill carefully. He hadn't completely
                    recovered from the morning. So I knew that this was going to be damaging. But I
                    couldn't take it away from him. Every time he bowed he bowed lower and lower. I
                    was afraid he might collapse face forward on the mats. And as soon as all the
                    guests had arrived or most of them I got him out of the line and we put him over
                    at a table nearby. This was in the main reception salon of the ambassador's
                    residence. Several tables were placed around the hall.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Mrs. Allison came over and sat down, and started to converse with him. By that
                    time they'd given him another gin and tonic, a brand new one. Fortunately at
                    least, he was by this time in conversation with Mrs. Allison, and wasn't
                    drinking it. Well, I don't think they'd been talking more than three or four
                    minutes when Mrs. Allison asked him a question. Strangely enough although he was
                    a little tipsy he was still quite rational. He was explaining something, and
                    suddenly he swung his arms open in a wide gesture, knocked over this tall gin
                    and tonic and it all drained over into Mrs. Allison's lap. She was wearing a
                    brand new specially tailored Chinese brocade that the Ambassador had ordered for
                    her from Hong Kong and had been done by her dressmaker. The drink splashed all
                    over her new suit, cocktail suit. Obviously, she was very angry and so was the
                    ambassador. All in all it didn't make for a very successful party.</p>
                <p>We had to stay a while. But I finally got Faulkner out fairly early. The party
                    broke up. We took him out to the Army officer's club and fed him a good meal.
                    That sobered him up a little bit, and we took him back to the International
                    House.</p>
                <p>The next morning the Ambassador sent me a letter by courier, saying, I want to
                    know what idiot in USIA or the Department of State ever thought of sending this
                    lush, this drunk over here to participate in a nationally advertised seminar. I
                    want you to give me one good reason why I shouldn't put this character back on
                    the next plane to the United States and cancel his whole visit. That was about
                    ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p>Of course, all the professors had arrived at Nagano waiting for the great
                    personage to show up. And I debated what in the world to do to satisfy the
                    Ambassador. Finally about three o'clock I wrote him a letter back. I said that I
                    was very sorry this had happened. In his letter the Ambassador had said “I never
                    expected that he would embarrass me and my wife to such an extent, et cetera, et
                    cetera.” I wrote back and I said I was very sorry all this had happened, that I
                    had no idea that anything like this would occur. And I had thought I would be
                    able to deliver to him a perfectly sober Nobel Prize winner. But I felt that we
                    couldn't send him back now and terminate the program as far as we were into
                    it—that I thought we could keep him under control and he would make a great
                    contribution.</p>
                <p>I hadn't heard anything back when the work day ended. It happened to be the day
                    on which the Ambassador was giving a big party for the embassy staff. He did
                    this two or three times a year so he could get closer and more familiar on a
                    friendly basis with his staff.</p>
                <p>The embassy population was pretty large, and when I got there the party was
                    already well underway. I could tell by the decibel count that several drinks had
                    already been served. When I got up to the party which was being held on the roof
                    garden of the apartment in which I was living in the embassy compound, the
                    Ambassador was there in an aloha shirt, and, in a fine mood. He had another
                    drink in his hand. I went over to him wondering what in the world I was going to
                    get as a response. And he said, “Lew, you were right.” He said, “I lost my cool.
                    I'm sorry. The guy can stay. But I'm going to hold you responsible and he better
                    perform all right.”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>Well, Leon managed to keep Bill under control, not always, but for most of the
                    time he was a relatively sober guy. His performance in Nagano was tremendous.
                    The Japanese kind of like drunks anyway, especially if they're
                    artists—celebrities of one type or another. He was vastly successful in making a
                    tremendous impression on the Japanese who were there. He got excellent press as
                    we mentioned earlier. Harry Keith stage managed a picture called “William
                    Faulkner in Japan” which was beautifully done. It was narrated by a then JOT who
                    now is the PAO in Tokyo, some thirty years later, Jack Shellenberger, who had
                    been a radio announcer before he came into the USIA program. All in all it was a
                    tremendous success.</p>
                <p>After Faulkner had returned to the States, we were having a staff meeting, the
                    first Ambassador staff meeting after Faulkner's departure. I reported that the
                    Faulkner visit was over and that it had gone very well, that we had had a great
                    response, that the press reports were all favorable, and the Japanese were
                    enchanted and what not. So Andy Kerr, the rather cynical number two man in the
                    Economic Section said, “Well, was it because he really was all that good? Or was
                    it just because he had a big name having won a Nobel Prize?” I didn't think very
                    fast. And I said, well, it was a little of both. But anyway, his was an
                    effective program. Afterwards, I thought what I really should have said was:
                    “Andy, you're missing the whole point. It doesn't make any difference what the
                    reason was. The fact that he got that kind of coverage and made that kind of an
                    impression was the important thing. And it was a tremendously successful
                    program.” But I wasn't quick enough on the trigger to have said what I ought to
                    have said. At lease it was a successful program.</p>
                <p>A Triumph for our Cultural Attach�</p>
                <p>A third thing that I would like to mention just very briefly. Margaret Williams
                    had long since returned to Washington. We had as our cultural attach� at that
                    time a man by the name of Glenn Shaw. He had been an educational missionary in
                    Japan and had lived practically all his adult life except during the war in
                    Japan. He spoke Japanese fluently. His accent wasn't all that good. But he was
                    perfect in his syntax and knew Japanese like a native.</p>
                <p>He also was absolutely steeped in Japanese culture. He probably knew more about
                    Japanese cultural arts than the Japanese did themselves.</p>
                <p>On one occasion in the, I think it was the spring of '55, some sort of a cultural
                    fair was being given by the Japan prefectural office up in Kanazawa. A lot of
                    people gathered up there. At that time the Japanese communist party, although
                    not a legal party was still very active in Japan, and they had all kinds of
                    representatives at the fair. They had infiltrated the organizational committee
                    and managed to get much of their material included in this cultural program.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>We hadn't realized the extent to which they were infiltrating. Our branch PAO,
                    Paul Bethel in Nagoya, who at that time was responsible also for managing the
                    north coast part of our USIS operation, had gone up to attend this fair. He soon
                    realized what was happening, so he sent an emergency call down to Tokyo to get
                    Glenn Shaw up there. Glenn went up and extemporaneously gave a series of
                    discussions through the afternoon citing all sorts of Japanese cultural
                    achievements, bringing down the house, and thus very effectively counteracting
                    the communist surge. There was nobody on the communist side that had the kind of
                    background that he had or the knowledge of Japanese history. Since then, I think
                    the Russians have trained many more people in usable Japanese. But at that time
                    they didn't have them. So Glenn largely rescued us from an otherwise unhappy and
                    overmatched situation. He also received more press coverage than the left
                    wingers did.</p>
                <p>Dr. Compton Visits USIS/Japan</p>
                <p>Well, I jumped way ahead of the chronological story, but I now will come back to
                    late 1952. The Director if IIA, or I guess it was by this time the General
                    Manager, had changed again. The new man was one of the Compton Brothers. Two of
                    them were famous scientists, and university professors. The third was a rancher,
                    I believe, in eastern Washington. There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that
                    when a new General Manager was to be appointed for IIA, the intent was to
                    appoint either Arthur or Karl, the physicists. By mistake, the third brother was
                    called, accepted, and could not be dismissed after the error was discovered. I
                    can believe it. I do not recall this Compton's given name, but in any event, he
                    arrived with several other officers from IIA for a Tokyo visit just before the
                    November election in 1952. He asked for an appointment with Ambassador
                    Murphy.</p>
                <p>I have mentioned Murphy earlier. He was a brilliant man, who didn't suffer fools
                    easily. The Ambassador agreed to see Compton, not in his office but in an
                    anteroom at the Residence at about 8:00 a.m. I don't recall why I was the one
                    who escorted Compton to the Residence. (Sax was still PAO, but this must have
                    been the time he was on home leave. However, Olcott Deming, his deputy was in
                    Tokyo.) Compton appeared to be absolutely stupid. He talked disconnectedly, made
                    childish remarks, couldn't address a significant subject, and worst of all,
                    seemed to have no idea what he should say to the busy Ambassador of whom he had
                    requested an audience. I could see Murphy getting edgier and edgier, and finally
                    really angry. Somehow I managed to make an excuse to conclude the interview and
                    get Compton out. Murphy must have thought poorly of the caliber of IIA if he
                    judged it by its then chief.</p>
                <p>Compton wasn't through with his absurdities. A couple days later, Eisenhower was
                    elected. Compton called an ad hoc meeting of the top USIS officers, and told
                    them that: “Don't worry! The election of Eisenhower won't make any difference.
                    I'm a life-long Republican, and I will be kept in my job.” In less than a month
                    he was dismissed.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>From Tokyo, he and his wife, who accompanied him, went to Southeast Asia. A
                    conference of some sort was being held in Rangoon, which Compton was to attend.
                    While he was conferencing, some of the Burmese employees tried to entertain Mrs.
                    Compton with a sightseeing tour that included Burma's famous and historic Golden
                    Pagoda. To make conversation, one of the Burmese ladies asked Mrs. Compton how
                    she liked it. Her reply: “Yes, it's lovely, but don't you think it is rather
                    extravagant for such a poor country?” That story is not apocryphal.</p>
                <p>Sax Bradford's Home Leave and the Cultural Center Closings</p>
                <p>I'll back up now to the point where Sax Bradford went on home leave some months
                    before he became the assistant director of USIA for Far East. When he left we
                    were already under pressure from Washington to start cutting back on the size of
                    the Japanese program. He realized we would have to close several—at least eight
                    and probably ten—of the cultural centers. Before he left there was a session
                    with him, Pat van Delden as the field program head and Olcott Deming who was the
                    deputy PAO. Deming was a State Department officer but on loan to USIS, USIA. And
                    with Sax's suggestions and with their recommendations they finally determined on
                    eight that they would definitely offer to close and two more that they would
                    close if they had to.</p>
                <p>There was great reluctance. Pat van Delden, Olcott Deming and I were at the
                    meeting. I was there because I would have had to handle all the logistics of the
                    center closings. I was upset at the number that were to be closed, but I said
                    very little at that time.</p>
                <p>Olcott and Pat argued with Sax about the closings. Sax said, well, I don't like
                    it either. But we're going to have to close them, I think, because Washington
                    wants us to cut back on the size of the Japan operation.</p>
                <p>So he went on home leave thinking that the closing of eight or ten centers was
                    settled. He assured everybody in Washington that he had selected the ten centers
                    that would be closed, but that they wouldn't be eliminated before the end of the
                    year.</p>
                <p>While he was gone Pat began to rethink this whole problem, and felt that she just
                    couldn't bring herself to close ten centers. They would close four of them but
                    they would ask Washington to permit them to retain the remaining 19, having
                    closed one of the two in Tokyo already early in the game.</p>
                <p>She and Olcott got together one evening, spent about half the night plotting what
                    they were going to do, and finally sent a telegram to Washington saying we have
                    decided we cannot close eight or ten centers. We propose to close only four of
                    them. We'll examine the others later on. For the time being we're going to
                    retain 19.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Well, Sax was not only on home leave but he was at his hometown in Phoenix,
                    Arizona, at the time this cable came in. Of course, it went directly against
                    anything that he had just gotten through telling the people in Washington he was
                    going to do.</p>
                <p>When he got back to Washington—I guess they phoned him, and said, what's going on
                    here? He rushed back to Washington and was apoplectic about this reversal. He
                    just said, well, when I left I thought we had agreed on these closings. I'll
                    have to take care of it when I return.</p>
                <p>When he returned he blamed me for the whole reversal. He said, “Boy, you guys
                    really undercut me on that policy. I'll never forget that as long as I live.” He
                    was rather hostile to me the rest of his tour of duty both as PAO, Japan, and as
                    the Assistant Director for Far East. Actually it was Pat and Olcott Deming, not
                    I, who had altered the closing plan. But I didn't even try to dissuade him. I
                    felt I had to roll with the punch. To do otherwise would have seriously undercut
                    both Pat and Olcott, and look as though I was attempting to save my own skin by
                    blaming them.</p>
                <p>If I remember correctly, we finally did get down to fourteen centers, and later
                    closed another two. Twelve remained. Not very long after Sax left Japan to
                    become Assistant Director of USIA for the Far East, Pat van Delden developed a
                    health problem and was returned to Washington. Walt Nichols moved up from Kobe
                    to succeed her as Field Supervisor. We retained the Kobe Regional Office for a
                    year or more after that with newly arrived Jerry Novick as Regional Officer.
                    After my departure from Japan, Washington ordered more centers closed and the
                    Kobe Regional Office was eliminated. Ultimately USIS eliminated all regional
                    offices and ran the field program directly from Tokyo.</p>
                <p>I don't remember exactly when Sax returned from home leave, probably late in 1952
                    or early 1953, and he was there for several months before being called back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, through much of 1952, we had been continuously trying to fill as many
                    as possible of the 135 positions originally authorized, but it became obvious,
                    as indicated by pressure to close centers, that there would have to be some
                    cutback. I doubt if we ever filled more than 85 or 90 of that initial
                    authorization. Then, came the Eisenhower inauguration in January, 1953. As is
                    always the case with a new administration, particularly one involving a change
                    from the political party holding the White House, the Republicans believed the
                    Government in general, and the Foreign Service in particular, was vastly
                    overstaffed. The resulting cut-back fell pretty heavily on USIS Tokyo. We lost
                    all the unfilled American positions, and five or six other Tokyo headquarters
                    jobs besides. One casualty was my young assistant.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The heartbreaking part of the roll back was the need to eliminate a substantial
                    number of Japanese jobs. I remember having to call a meeting of the entire
                    Japanese staff. The rumors of coming dismissals had been circulating for some
                    weeks, and the whole staff was terribly upset. Japan had not yet gotten out of
                    its economic trough, and finding new employment threatened anyone dismissed with
                    real hardship. Before the meeting, I had determined pretty well how many we were
                    going to have to prune, and realized that if we were forced to close as many
                    centers as we apparently had to, we could satisfy a large part of the RIF there.
                    We still had to lose some from the Tokyo contingent. The meeting was long and
                    painful, but I think we managed it as well as could be expected under the
                    circumstances. The few we had to let go were given some help in the transition,
                    and things calmed down after a few weeks.</p>
                <p>Of the Americans outside of Tokyo, one was the man who had been running our
                    cultural center in Kanazawa on the north coast of Japan, a fellow named Robert
                    Flershem. Flershem was an interesting gentleman. I would say he was in his late
                    30's or early 40's, and was sort of a loner. He enjoyed living alone—away from
                    other Americans—and he especially enjoyed being on the north coast of Japan
                    where he got a minimum of attention from headquarters. The Japanese all liked
                    him, and he was doing a very creditable job there.</p>
                <p>I have already discussed the impending center closings, and so we decided that
                    Flershem's job was one of those we might eliminate. His name went on the list of
                    those to be returned home. He took the plane out of Tokyo to Seattle. Those were
                    the days of prop planes. It took about 22 hours to reach Seattle. Transpacific
                    travelers were entitled to a one night stopover en route to Washington. Flershem
                    chose Seattle. He was scheduled out the next afternoon on a Northwest Airline
                    flight to DC. He boarded the plane. It taxied down the runway and burst into
                    flame. There was an emergency evacuation. No one was killed, but Flershem was
                    rather badly burned and had to be hospitalized.</p>
                <p>It was some time before he got back to Washington, and because of his injury, he
                    was still technically an employee of DepState and entitled to State supported
                    medical care. He was later moved to Washington and hospitalized there. By the
                    time he was released the Administration had decided they'd made a mistake and
                    had eliminated too many slots in the Foreign Service. DepState issued authority
                    for us to rehire people in about a half dozen or so positions from our Japan
                    program. We hadn't closed Kanazawa after all, and so, suddenly, Flershem was
                    rehabilitated, remained on the rolls, and went back to Kanazawa, owing his
                    longevity in service to his unhappy accident of being burned in a plane disaster
                    in Seattle while on the verge of separation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could I ask what happened to the center that had to move
                        out of Tokyo when you didn't get the funding?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, we finally—I forgot to mention that. We finally did get a building
                    which had been a Japanese women's cultural club, sort of a—it's a Kaikan. They
                    called it the Joshi Kaikan which in free translation means the women's club. It
                    was a cultural club to which the young women of the country or the city could
                    belong. They could have meetings there. Or hold conferences, programs, etc. in
                    the Center. This was not under our control. This was completely Japanese.</p>
                <p>But the organizations had faltered during the war and the occupation period. The
                    Joshi Kaikan was not greatly in use. And while its location was not as desirable
                    as the one that we had had in downtown Tokyo they eventually did turn it over to
                    us. I understand now that there is a new one that is a much better center. The
                    Tokyo Cultural Center in the Joshi Kaikan reopened, I think, about the middle
                    of—or in early 1953 and operated for a number of years at that location.</p>
                <p>Somebody else will tell the story of the transition from the State Department
                    USIE to U.S. Information Agency. I believe that someone is going to interview
                    Abbott Washburn who was named the first Deputy Director of the new U.S.
                    Information Agency. And he was, to appropriate the title of a book written by
                    Dean Acheson, Present at the Creation. So I won't try to go into any of the
                    details. Anyway I was not personally present. But it, of course, affected us out
                    in the area. The State Department, still treating all Information Officers as
                    inferiors, immediately decided that we were no longer a State Department entity.
                    Our program, as of August 1, 1953, because an independent agency, reporting
                    directly to the President, and called The U.S. Information Agency (USIA). I
                    should note that more than a year before this change over, USIE had been
                    reorganized—still under DepState, as a semi-autonomous entity—a status not
                    unlike that of AID today—headed by a general manager, and titled the
                    International Information Administration (or Agency, I have forgotten which) and
                    known as IIA. We operated in that fashion until Eisenhower issued the August 1,
                    1953 Executive Order creating us an independent agency.</p>
                <p>Up to that time there had only been two types of passport. One was the regular
                    tourist passport and the other was the diplomatic passport. State—largely at the
                    imperious suggestion of Mrs. Shipley who then controlled all DepState passport
                    issuances—created a so called special passport with a red cover, and those are
                    the kind under which USIA had to operate for the next several years, until Mrs.
                    Shipley retired from Consular and Security Office of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that called an official passport then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: It was called a special passport, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Special passport.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: And it was given to people like us heathens, the USIA, and what is not
                    AID personnel, who, when it came into existence, had to operate on the special
                    passport. As I say, that went on for a number of years. I've forgotten just when
                    it was that they finally conceded. Mrs. Shipley left and a new head of the
                    passport operation came in. And from that point on we went back to diplomatic
                    passport entitlement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one stage did you replace Sax Bradford? Or were you
                        acting director of USIS in Tokyo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, yes in a way, but that's a little different story. I didn't
                    replace Sax Bradford. I'll cover that one now since you've asked the question.
                    Eisenhower created the new independent agency as a result of the so-called
                    Jackson Committee Report. C.D. Jackson had been asked to head an ad hoc
                    committee to study the matter of U.S. overseas information programs. His report
                    recommended that the Information program be taken out of the Department of
                    State, which didn't want it in those days. Dulles was adamant about that. The
                    committee didn't confine itself just to recommending separation—it went on to
                    propose a good deal of the internal reorganization of what was to be USIA. Ted
                    Streibert was named USIA's first Director. He accepted the committee report
                    almost in toto. Perhaps the most significant element of the reorganization which
                    Streibert adopted was the one that set up four regional offices. These were to
                    be—and for many years were—the most prestigious and powerful units in USIA.
                    Streibert looked for men who were considered to be the officers most capable of
                    heading up these elements. Each one was to be designated Assistant Director of
                    USIA for (region).</p>
                <p>He selected Sax Bradford to be the head of the Far East, Bill Clark to direct
                    Latin America, and Hunt Damon for the Near East and North Africa. I do not
                    remember who if anyone headed Europe at that time, but soon Bill Clark was moved
                    over to Direct the European region, and his deputy, Frank Oram, succeeded to the
                    direction of Latin America.</p>
                <p>So, Sax left, quite suddenly. His deputy, Olcott Deming, had already gone, so for
                    two or three months, we had no director—or designated deputy. I was not named
                    Acting PAO at that time.</p>
                <p>Willard Hannah becomes PAO: Hannah andThe Terrible Tempered Mr. Allison</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, Willard Hannah came out to be the PAO. He had a fine academic
                    background, and he was also a very competent administrator. He had been PAO in
                    Indonesia for about 4 � years and had proven his worth out there by ingratiating
                    himself with Sukarno. In fact he was practically on a first name basis with
                    Sukarno and all the top officials of the Indonesian government as it took over
                    from the Dutch and began its period of independence. He was an unusually capable
                    officer, very intelligent. But somewhat short tempered. And this provides an
                    opportunity to give us another example of some of the things that happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>When the Eisenhower Administration took over they wanted their own man as
                    ambassador in Tokyo. And much to the disgruntlement of Bob Murphy who thought he
                    was going to be ambassador out there for at least three or four years, the
                    Department told him he was going to be replaced.</p>
                <p>Dulles had been instrumental in drafting the peace treaty with Japan, and as his
                    assistant in working on the peace treaty preparation he had taken John Allison
                    who at that time was the head of one of the regional bureaus—or rather one of
                    the divisions in the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs. Allison so impressed Dulles
                    that he apparently decided if the opportunity ever arose, he would make Allison
                    Ambassador to Tokyo. When the Peace Treaty went into effect in April, 1952, the
                    unit that had been the Diplomatic Section of GHQ SCAP became the Embassy. As
                    indicated earlier, Bob Murphy became Ambassador. However, shortly after
                    Eisenhower's inauguration, Dulles became Secretary of State, and appointed
                    Allison Ambassador to Japan.</p>
                <p>Allison was a rather touchy man. And, he had minimum respect for USIA. Above all,
                    he was extremely wary of the press, and didn't want to have anymore to do with
                    it than he could help. Worse, he had the erroneous idea that if he withheld
                    information from the press on any problem facing the embassy, the press would
                    somehow refrain from reporting anything about it. Two incidents occurring during
                    Hannah's incumbency illustrate the difficulty for USIS of operating with
                    Ambassador Allison.</p>
                <p>The Lucky Dragon Affair</p>
                <p>In the late spring or early summer of 1954, the American Government conducted the
                    second of its atomic bomb tests in the Pacific. They gave prolonged radio notice
                    that a very large area of the sea around the atoll on which the test was to be
                    conducted would be forbidden to shipping. But Japanese fishing vessels operating
                    in the area were in those days without any radio contact, so no one got word to
                    them that they would be anywhere near where the atomic explosion was to be
                    detonated. One such boat with perhaps a dozen fishermen aboard was “The Lucky
                    Dragon.” The boat sailed directly through the radiologically contaminated zone.
                    The first thing they knew, the ship began collecting a blanket of gray-white
                    ash. They had no idea as to its source. And so they started picking it up and
                    brushing it off the boat. Finally, there got to be such a mantle on the boat
                    that they got out their brooms and swept it off. Still they kept picking it up
                    and looking at it, trying to figure out what it was and where it was coming
                    from.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>At last they sailed out of the fallout area. They had pretty well gotten their
                    catch anyway, so they started back for Japan. Well, the trawler they were on was
                    a rather slow moving ship, so it took them about a week or ten days to reach
                    Japan. Before they did they all became violently ill. None of them died, but
                    they were all just deathly sick. Understandably, they couldn't imagine what had
                    happened to them. Of course, what had happened was that the ash from the atomic
                    explosion had gone up into the stratosphere and then precipitated back out,
                    landing on the Lucky Dragon.</p>
                <p>When they hit the small fishing port down on the southwestern coast of Honshu,
                    they reported in to the nearest medical center. It happened that there were some
                    medical people nearby who had taken care of some of the survivors of Hiroshima.
                    Immediately, of course, they determined what the difficulty was.</p>
                <p>Well, the word got to Tokyo about a day later, and the whole foreign press took
                    off for this small village including practically every American correspondent,
                    in fact every American correspondent who was there, as well as British, French,
                    German, everybody else. They were all down to this small village.</p>
                <p>They weren't permitted to get near the ship when they got down there. The
                    Japanese authorities screened them off because they didn't want them to get in
                    touch with the people who were suffering from the atomic fallout. I don't know
                    whether any of the fishermen actually died. I don't think they did. Undoubtedly,
                    it affected them in later life because they had suffered a severe dosage.</p>
                <p>Well, Mr. Allison, Ambassador Allison, decided that if we didn't tell the press
                    anything about it, and refused to comment on what had happened that they
                    wouldn't have any story. Therefore the problem would simply go away.</p>
                <p>Willard Hannah having handled the press very extensively realized that this was
                    the worst thing that one could possibly do, that it would simply pique the
                    curiosity and raise the anger of all the correspondents who had been denied
                    information. Willard went to see Allison and had a tumultuous session with the
                    Ambassador trying to persuade him of the necessity of doing something about it.
                    Allison steadfastly refused to talk to the press or allow any information to be
                    released by the embassy at all.</p>
                <p>So Hannah had to go down to the Foreign Press Club and face the whole gamut of
                    press people. He couldn't even tell them that it was Allison who refused;
                    Allison had forbidden his to say that this was an order from the Ambassador. He
                    simply had to go down and tell them “No comment.”</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>So Hannah faced the press with no logical defense. Of course, the press was
                    irate. They blamed him for covering up information. It was a very rough session.
                    He came back utterly exhausted by the whole thing and terribly depressed.</p>
                <p>The next day he went back to Allison and tried again to persuade him that what
                    was going to happen was that his refusal would erupt into a terrible brouhaha in
                    the press—that the whole embassy would be denigrated for being uncooperative.
                    Allison still wouldn't budge. The result was that he and Willard got into a real
                    shouting match. I wasn't present at the match. But Willard came back and said,
                    I'm afraid that I got rather profane and the Ambassador was even more profane.
                    We just called each other a whole series of unprintable names.</p>
                <p>I was about due to go on home leave. I was supposed to leave for the States about
                    the first of June and this was mid or late May, I think or thereabouts. Willard
                    came back and went into a long session with himself. By the time I left to go
                    back on home leave he had just about decided that he couldn't live under
                    Allison's regime, that he was going to resign. I tried to persuade him not to
                    resign. But as it turned out he did. While I was on home leave he submitted his
                    resignation, not only as PAO in Japan but from USIA, went off and joined the
                    American Field Service where he subsequently had an excellent career as sort of
                    a roving reporter who went all around the world making contacts with high level
                    people everywhere, especially in Indonesia, and never returned to Government
                    again. The Agency lost one of its finest officers.</p>
                <p>Ken Bunce was in Japan with USIS at the time that Willard left. I was away on
                    home leave. So Willard appointed Ken as acting PAO during the absence of a new
                    PAO being appointed for Tokyo. Willard proved to be extremely prophetic and
                    absolutely correct. A terrible brouhaha had erupted in the press. And the
                    embassy and Willard personally were vilified as being restrictive, disruptive
                    and non-cooperative. The press raked the whole embassy and especially Willard up
                    and down for failure to cooperate. It was a very unhappy time.</p>
                <p>The Battle Over Press Handling of the Governors' Visit</p>
                <p>I've forgotten now whether it was somewhat before that or somewhat after that—I
                    think it was before that—when our press attach� had a similar unhappy experience
                    with the Ambassador. A group of governors, 12 of them, were visiting Tokyo. Of
                    course, the Ambassador had to entertain them and spend a good deal of time with
                    them.</p>
                <p>The big party was to be a big dinner for the visiting governors at the
                    ambassador's residence one evening about midway through their week and a half in
                    Japan. Naturally, the American press wanted an interview with the governors to
                    get their impressions of Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>John Henderson was our press attach�. John actually had been a USIA employee who
                    had been integrated into the State Department Foreign Service under the Wriston
                    program in 1953 and '54. But he was nevertheless, assigned back to USIA or USIS,
                    and he was serving as our press attach�.</p>
                <p>He went up to the residence early in the evening before the dinner, but while the
                    preliminary cocktails were being served. Because he knew the press was coming
                    up, he had told the ambassador (or at least he claimed he had done so) that the
                    members of the press wanted to meet with the governors, and he asked if he could
                    bring them up to the residence. According to John, the Ambassador had rather
                    grudgingly said, ah, bring them up for a few minutes, words to that effect.</p>
                <p>So the press arrived while the cocktail party was in session. And John went in to
                    tell the Ambassador that they were there. By that time the Ambassador had had a
                    couple of drinks himself along with the governors. I don't really know what
                    caused him to act as he did. But he said, I'm not going to interview those sons
                    of bitches. John started to argue with him and said, “You can't do this to the
                    press. You know you'll have a big problem if you do.” The Ambassador was utterly
                    adamant.</p>
                <p>Finally, both John and the Ambassador walked out of the main salon where the
                    governors were and where the cocktail party was proceeding, into the anteroom
                    where the press were waiting. And where John and the Ambassador proceeded to
                    have a profane shouting match at one another. And the Ambassador in effect said,
                    you're through.</p>
                <p>The next morning John came into the office and said, I'm sorry, but I'm going to
                    be removed as the press attach�. I've got to go elsewhere. Within less than a
                    week he was out of Tokyo and was assigned as press attach� in Indonesia.
                    Fortunately, he didn't get cashiered from the foreign service. But he had to
                    leave Tokyo, and we were several months without a press attach� because of that
                    episode.</p>
                <p>So, you see, it wasn't very easy to operate under Mr. Allison if you were a USIA
                    officer. Because he didn't have much use for the press, he didn't have much
                    respect for us either. He was not terribly cooperative with the press under the
                    best of circumstances, and these two episodes indicate some of the difficulties
                    we had.</p>
                <p>The Deputy PAO Episode</p>
                <p>Before I left on home leave, Willard Hannah called me in and told me he was going
                    to recommend that I be appointed Deputy PAO for Japan. Knowing Sax Bradford's
                    attitude toward me, I thanked Willard, but told him I doubted his recommendation
                    would be accepted. He felt that with his recommendation, there was a good chance
                    it would be. We left it at that.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Another incident had occurred earlier which I felt sure would make Willard's
                    recommendation ineffectual. In the spring of 1954, I had received a letter from
                    the Agency's personnel office, noting that my first tour was concluding, and
                    what preferences did I have for my next assignment? It had been no secret that I
                    had wanted to be DPAO. A number of officers of some rank had spoken favorably
                    about such an appointment in Washington. When I received the letter, I was
                    pretty sure that the idea had been vetoed. I wrote a long reply, saying, in
                    substance, that I had long hoped for such advancement, that the personnel letter
                    was the veiled answer that my hopes were not to materialize, and that, given
                    those circumstances, I would just as soon return for a second tour as Executive
                    Officer in Tokyo. This request was granted.</p>
                <p>I learned later that my letter had created quite a stir in the Administrative
                    Area in the Agency, and resulted in a renewed push in some quarters to give me
                    the DPAO job. Before long, I received letters from friends in Washington, saying
                    that everyone who knew about the situation, exclusive of Director Streibert who
                    left all such decisions to Area Directors, and, of course, Bradford, had
                    unanimously supported my appointment. This was especially true of the head of
                    Personnel and the Administrative Area in general. However, Bradford had vetoed
                    it, and given the power of Area Directors, that was it.</p>
                <p>Just two or three weeks after those letters from Washington friends, Bradford
                    made one of his periodic visits to Tokyo. I knew he had to say something to me
                    during his visit. However, he studiously avoided me, even keeping a discreet
                    distance at a cocktail party at which we were both in attendance. Finally, on
                    his last day, only two or three hours before his plane was scheduled to depart,
                    he appeared in my office. It was after hours, and on one but myself was there.
                    He entered and sat down. I don't remember his precise words, but the following
                    is a pretty good paraphrase of his story. Smiling unctuously, he said: Lew, I
                    wanted to give you a summary of what happened to your attempt to be named DPAO.
                    You had extensive support throughout the Agency, including from me, but those
                    doggone characters in Personnel and the Administrative Area just nixed it. I
                    guess they are jealous of any one from Administration getting this type of
                    promotion if they don't.</p>
                <p>I sat there for a couple seconds, thinking: “The liar! Do I or don't I have the
                    guts to call his fabrication?” Before I had time to lose my nerve, I looked him
                    right in the eye, and said: “Sax, within the past few days, I have had several
                    letters from friends in Washington telling me that as far as anyone else in the
                    Agency is concerned, I could have the job. This includes everyone in
                    Administration. But you are the one that nixed the deal!”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The Bradford reaction was startling. I had read of such physical changes in
                    fiction, but I had never seen it in the flesh. He was absolutely silent for
                    several seconds, during which time every drop of color drained out of his
                    usually rather ruddy complexion. His face went to a sallow white. His eyes,
                    which were naturally a rather pale blue almost literally lost all color. I kept
                    my eyes on his, so I don't know if he trembled, but without regaining his color
                    or composure, he said: “Well, that's the way it is.” and got up and left. I knew
                    my promotion goose was cooked as long as he remained the Assistant Director of
                    USIA for Far East.</p>
                <p>The Balance of the Tokyo Tour</p>
                <p>I left on home leave the end of May, and returned during the first week in
                    September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had a new PAO been assigned to Tokyo by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: No, and it was to be a full year before one was assigned. As I said
                    earlier, Ken Bunce had been appointed as Acting PAO while I was away on home
                    leave, and he remained in that capacity until his departure from Japan in late
                    April or early May of 1955. I returned to my assignment as Executive Officer,
                    which, among other duties, involved handling the logistics of some further
                    Cultural Center closings.</p>
                <p>In some cases of proposed closings, the Prefectural Governors became terribly
                    exercised. One of them, from Takamatsu on the north coast of the Island of
                    Shikoku, came to Tokyo to plead his case personally. He saw Ken Bunce, and
                    wanted to see the Ambassador. I can't remember whether we actually got him an
                    appointment with Allison or not. In any event, his pleas were effective enough
                    to cause us to leave an American officer (Harry Kendall, who was already there)
                    in that Center. In one or two other cases, we agreed to keep the centers,
                    support them at a lesser level, and leave the running entirely to the Japanese
                    staff. In those instances, the prefectures agreed to pay some of the operational
                    costs.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, when Ken Bunce left in the spring of 1955, I was
                    designated Acting Country PAO. I have already mentioned the preliminaries of
                    staging for the Atoms for Peace Exhibit; the immensely productive 1955 Nagano
                    Seminar with William Faulkner as the piece de resistance, and the saving of the
                    American reputation by Glenn Shaw at the fair in Kanazawa, all of which occurred
                    during my “Acting” period. Also during that summer, we presented the Tokyo
                    performances and Japan wide tour of the Symphony of the Air, mentioned earlier.
                    And I personally take credit for another musical coup. I cannot recall whether
                    the three musicians involved had come to Japan as part of the Symphony, or as
                    part of another—a chamber music—group. In any event, I knew that many smaller
                    cities in Japan had longed for the visit of an American musical ensemble.
                    Neither the Symphony nor the larger chamber ensemble had considered it
                    sufficiently important to visit any of these smaller cities. In talking to three
                    members of whichever group it was, I learned that they had no immediate
                    commitments in the U.S., and would like to stay on a bit after their group
                    concerts were completed. I arranged for them to constitute themselves as a
                    chamber group: pianist, cellist, and violinist. We christened them “The American
                    Trio” and sent them out on a 24 town/city tour. Their audiences were wildly
                    enthusiastic, the press coverage was ecstatic, and the men themselves had a
                    wonderful time, enhanced doubly by their enthusiastic audiences.</p>
                <p>The Accomplishments of Fazl Fotouhi</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any other points you wish to cover regarding
                        the Japan program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, I wouldn't want to leave the discussion of Japan without
                    mentioning briefly some of the work done by other highly competent officers who
                    were part of that unusually fine group in the Japan program. The most unique
                    experience and performance was probably the one by a man named A. Fazl
                    Fotouhi.</p>
                <p>Fazl was Iranian by birth, a naturalized American citizen, married to a charming
                    American woman. A very friendly sort of individual. We were lucky. I don't know
                    whether he was employed by USIA already. I think he had been. But anyway, he
                    spoke both Iranian (Farsi) and English, had a very slight accent in English. He
                    came out to Japan to be one of the center directors, and we sent him down to
                    Hiroshima.</p>
                <p>By that time Hiroshima was partially rebuilt, fairly well rebuilt from the atom
                    bomb attack. And it was the center of a medical research program still run at
                    that time under the auspices of the American Army for the rehabilitation and
                    treatment of victims of the atom bomb. Already there were the beginnings of the
                    resentment which later became very strong in Japan about the Americans having
                    dropped the first atomic bomb in history on the hapless city of Hiroshima.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>So Fazl went down there. We told him he would likely have a rather tough row to
                    hoe because of the growing resentment. Well, I don't think there was anybody
                    except Glenn Shaw in Japan who became so beloved by the Japanese, as did Fazl. I
                    don't know what it was, but he just thoroughly immersed himself in Japan, and
                    things Japanese. He went to every function that the Japanese officialdom gave.
                    He was always available to them. He sent his daughter who at that time was only
                    about six or seven-years old to a Japanese public school where she learned
                    Japanese pretty well, children's Japanese anyway. Instead of sending her to one
                    of the available American schools, he sent her to the Japanese school. He was
                    there, I think, in all about five years. When he left you'd have thought they'd
                    lost their father confessor. He was so feted by the Japanese in leaving that
                    many years later they still talk about him and they still talk about his
                    departure from Hiroshima. He was a complete hero to he people down there and
                    thoroughly converted that whole segment of the area to a pro-American's
                    viewpoint. So I think that was another great success story which probably
                    happened by accident because we were lucky in getting somebody who could
                    establish that kind of rapport with the Japanese. Great praise should go to Fazl
                    for having done such a marvelous job of getting that segment of Japan in an area
                    where it could have been disastrous because of the resentment of the atomic
                    bomb, pretty well oriented towards things American. And I don't know of anybody
                    anywhere, perhaps there are others, who did as complete and successful job as
                    Fazl did in that five year period he spent in Hiroshima.</p>
                <p>Well, I think I've probably talked enough about Japan. There are other things
                    that could be said about how the program went. I left in late May of 1956. I
                    never went back officially to Japan although I have been back there probably 25
                    or more times since and spent various periods of time. It's a country of which I
                    will always be extremely fond. I fell in love with it when I first went there.
                    And I am very grateful for having had the experience to spend those 4� years
                    with the embassy. Let's cut this off at this point.</p>
                <p>The Objectives of USIS Japan</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Japan I wondered if you would comment a
                        little bit about what the goals or objectives were of USIS when you first
                        arrived there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, I must say that we had a general objective in mind which, of
                    course, was to make the Japanese thoroughly familiar with American cultural and
                    economic achievements. And also to continue the process which had been so well
                    begun by the Occupation of converting them into a favorable attitude toward the
                    United States. I've got to give the Army and the MacArthur regime tremendous
                    credit for having done a number of things. MacArthur overrode the objections of
                    a lot of highly placed persons in government in deciding to keep the Emperor as
                    a nominal head of government. That proved to be a tremendous decision. I agree
                    with scholars and historians who say it is the glue that held Japan together in
                    those crucial post defeat days. It's been talked about often. And I won't go on
                    further here.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>But above all he decided America was not going to go in as a tough occupying
                    power. These people had been defeated. They were hungry. They were already
                    disenchanted with their own Army and their own secret police which had treated
                    them abominably. By the time the war was over they hated their military. They
                    hated the secret police, the Kempeitai. At first they were scared to death
                    because they had been saturated with propaganda to the effect that the Americans
                    when they came in were going to rape all the women and tear down the whole
                    Japanese governmental structure, generally oppress the populace and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>Since I was there almost at the beginning of the Occupation, I can tell you that
                    the Japanese were scared stiff. The first day I was in Kyoto which was only
                    about 18 or 20 days at most after the armistice was signed we were the first
                    people—except for a small four man landing party—were the first people in Kyoto.
                    We were told we had to go armed with our pistols, because we didn't know what
                    was going to happen. And so I was wandering around Kyoto while the headquarters
                    that we were going to occupy was being set up in a partially finished concrete
                    skeleton building in downtown Kyoto on which construction had stopped when the
                    war began. Having been there in 1938, I was trying to find a couple of places in
                    Kyoto that I had visited then. My memory was not entirely accurate, and I didn't
                    immediately find them. But in the process I headed down a residential street not
                    far from the locale I was trying to find, but not the place I was looking
                    for.</p>
                <p>When my roommate and I, both of us with a pistol strapped on each hip, started
                    down that street, the street was full of kids. And every shutter was open. The
                    Japanese had wooden shutters on their windows which they always opened during
                    warm days and slid the windows open. This was early fall. Still pretty warm.
                    They were airing out the houses. I don't think we'd walked 20 steps down that
                    street, when every child had disappeared from sight, and practically every
                    shutter had snapped shut. By the time we walked through that street you would
                    have thought it was a deserted city. Absolutely nobody on the street. Once in a
                    while you could see somebody peeking through a shutter. But they were frightened
                    to death.</p>
                <p>Well, after about three days they discovered that none of this propaganda was
                    true, that the Americans were really going to help them. And the Americans being
                    naturally friendly anyway started giving chocolate bars to the kids. They hadn't
                    seen chocolate in years. And giving some of their sake rations to families that
                    they were getting in touch with, soon all that fear disappeared.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The basic gentleness with which the Occupation handled the entire operation was,
                    I think, tremendous. I don't think any other occupying power had ever before
                    done anything like it. The Japanese were so grateful that an American could do
                    no wrong. It was almost ridiculous. I won't take the time here to discuss a
                    number of interesting situations that occurred in my experience during that
                    first year of the occupation. The good treatment continued. I want to reiterate
                    that the Army had done a tremendous job, and even though they had carried on the
                    tradition of treating the Japanese well, if perhaps a little patronizingly, but
                    nevertheless, with kindness and understanding. And USIS picked up where they
                    left off. We wanted to expand on it. We wanted to increase the knowledge that we
                    inculcated into the Japanese as to the cultural background that the United
                    States had and give them extensive information about our cultural achievements.
                    We wanted them to understand that we were going to continue to treat them as
                    friends. And that generally we wanted to win their allegiance to the United
                    States. That was our major overall goal.</p>
                <p>Now, there were a couple of other ones that were related to that. One was the
                    extent to which the Occupation had given the Japanese a freedom they had not
                    previously known, and interfered as little as they felt they could afford to
                    with the Japanese return to normality. In short, we hoped to assist in guiding
                    them further toward democracy.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, the Occupation had openly allowed labor unions to form again. Japan
                    had never really allowed truly free labor unions to exist. Occupation
                    authorities didn't realize at first the extent of liberal thinking existing
                    among many of the young officers managing the labor union rebirth. There may
                    even have been a few people in the Occupation who might have had a communist
                    background. I won't say there weren't. But even if there was no communist
                    influence, there were a lot of very, very liberal young people who were writing
                    the labor code, and who didn't want to interfere with the formation of unions or
                    the activities of unions. The unions therefore had a very heady beginning and in
                    some areas were for a long time rather well infiltrated by native communist
                    party representatives. I mean, Japanese Communist party representatives.</p>
                <p>In fact I think it is possible the Japanese unions may have started the sit-in. I
                    say this because in my role in Japan in the first year I was in charge of the
                    economic activities in the Military Government Section of first, 6th Army and
                    later I Corps, Headquarters which controlled Japan from west and south of
                    Nagoya. And through my office had to come every Japanese corporation in the area
                    that wanted to convert from wartime operations to civilian manufacturing. Their
                    permit had to be issued from my office. We had to investigate their intentions,
                    see what they were going to do before granting the permit.</p>
                <p>One of the big corporations represented in that area was Mitsubishi, which had
                    had a large aircraft engine manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Kyoto. I
                    became very closely acquainted with the top management of that particular region
                    of the Mitsubishi operation. They were wanting to reopen several plants in the
                    area.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Eventually we did give them permission by the early spring of 1946 to start
                    resuming operations, and as soon as they did their new labor unions went on
                    strike. This was the first experience that the Japanese industry had ever had
                    with a really full-fledged strike, and they didn't know how to handle it. So at
                    first they were trying to act as they always did before whenever anybody came up
                    with a labor proposal. They were going to stonewall it.</p>
                <p>The next thing they knew the Japanese unions had moved in. They had about a
                    thousand people sitting down in the Mitsubishi factory and offices, and they
                    wouldn't get out. So the management all descended on my Military Government
                    office in Kyoto, pointing out this terrible phenomenon that had occurred and
                    what could they do with it? I had not been blessed with any organized labor
                    experience previously, and I don't know that I helped very much. But I did give
                    them a few suggestions. I told them they'd have to stop this stonewalling, that
                    they would simply have to negotiate some of their requirements, some of the
                    demands of their labor. And I thought that if they were reasonable in their
                    handling that they probably would come out all right. As it turned out they
                    did.</p>
                <p>I think the Japanese labor was so surprised that they got a favorable response
                    and some understanding and concessions that they themselves were amazed and they
                    withdrew. I still think that was probably one of the first if not the first
                    examples of a sit in of the labor movement. For Japan, I am sure it was.</p>
                <p>Well, that's a long way of saying that later on by the time we neared the end of
                    the Occupation the communist influence had infiltrated quite a bit of the labor
                    movement, particularly the seaman's union and to a lesser extent the civil
                    service unions. Although communists were still an illegal party they were
                    managing to make themselves rather obstreperous and they probably had a hand in
                    the May 1, 1952 riot I talked about earlier. They didn't get much support from
                    the general public. Even though the elections were not managed, communists
                    didn't score highly. They couldn't stand for election. They were not permitted
                    to put up a ticket at that time, but tried to make their power effective through
                    the Socialist Party.</p>
                <p>We were worried about their growing influence in certain quarters. So one of our
                    objectives was of course to try to counteract the influence of the communist
                    infiltration of various important areas of the Japanese business and industry
                    and also political front.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>A third objective stemmed from the fact that the Japanese were not terribly well
                    convinced that America was all that culturally advanced. And so another one of
                    our objectives was to impress them with the cultural achievements of the U.S.
                    and the widespread concern for and capabilities in the performing arts and arts
                    generally in the United States. I think we were reasonably successful in that
                    regard. One of the things we did not too long before I left Japan was to arrange
                    a visit to Japan of what was then called the American Symphony of the Air. It
                    had been the NBC Symphony Orchestra. And I think Stokowski had at one time been
                    conductor. NBC had just a short time earlier decided to discontinue their
                    contract with the orchestra. They were no longer going to broadcast regularly
                    for NBC. So they struck out on their own, renamed themselves the American
                    Symphony of the Air and sought engagements. They had no initial commitments
                    within the United States, so we negotiated a trip for them to Japan. And we
                    scheduled them all over the country. Many people don't realize or at least
                    didn't in those days, that the Japanese were not only great students of their
                    own music, but were tremendous aficionados of Western classical music. They're
                    nuts about it, and had little chance to enjoy it during the war years. No top
                    flight symphony orchestra had performed in Japan at least since some years
                    before the war. I am not sure one had ever visited Japan. So when we brought the
                    Symphony of the Air to Japan, the demand for tickets was enormous. The climax of
                    their visit was a joint concert with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra in Karakuen
                    Stadium, a huge baseball stadium in Tokyo which normally seats about 60,000, but
                    could only seat about 40,000 people for the orchestral performance.</p>
                <p>The demand for tickets was so great that people stood in line for 15 hours
                    starting the night before at the box office to get tickets. The 50,000 were
                    completely sold out. Peoples stood throughout the concert. Some climbed trees
                    outside to view and listen over the walls. As I noted earlier, Harry Keith shot
                    another notable motion picture around the Symphony Orchestra's visit which was
                    widely successful in Japan.</p>
                <p>We scheduled them not only in Tokyo but in I think about 12 to 15 Japanese
                    cities. It was probably the single most successful cultural event USIS staged in
                    Japan. It went a long way towards convincing the Japanese that the Americans
                    weren't just a bunch of shallow cultural people—that they didn't put on or were
                    incapable of staging excellent cultural performances.</p>
                <p>So I think those were basically our efforts at that time. We did have subsidiary
                    ones based on trying to convert or at least soften editorial writers and other
                    press representatives who were pretty well left wing oriented and who really
                    were taking off in the Japanese press against anything American. We had mixed
                    results there. I won't say that we were as successful in that regard as we were
                    in some other activities.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>But we did have a few minor successes, one of them brought off by the same Paul
                    Bethel that I talked about in connection with the episode when Glenn Shaw went
                    to the Kanazawa Fair. He spent about six months cultivating a major columnist
                    for the newspaper in Nagoya that was giving us a bad time. Both by extensive
                    personal contact and providing him extensive pertinent information setting forth
                    the American point of view. He had some success. He didn't convert the man, but
                    I think at least he tempered his anti-U.S. editorials a bit. At least for a time
                    the editorials seemed to be less vitriolic. I think Paul had a reasonable degree
                    of influence on them. There were a couple of other episodes of that nature when
                    we were working out other columnists with individuals assigned to them.</p>
                <p>The Book Translation Program</p>
                <p>I should mention one further thing and that is the Japanese had not yet in those
                    early days resuscitated their cultural magazines. Later they flourished and
                    became very important. But Leon Picon as the book translation officer was
                    greatly successful not only in getting a large number of books translated into
                    Japanese, getting them distributed and sold through Japanese book stores, and
                    introducing them into Japanese schools—he also established a magazine called the
                    Beisho Daiori (pronounced Bay Sho Dy-oh'ry) which was devoted to book reviews
                    (almost entirely) of American books in translation. The publication caught on
                    and was well accepted in Japanese cultural circles. It was still in existence in
                    1970, even after Japanese cultural publications had long been flourishing once
                    more, but it was finally superseded by the present magazine, printed at the USIS
                    Regional Service Center in Manila,—a much fancier, slicker magazine than the old
                    one. Leon's came at a time when Japan was only beginning to recover its cultural
                    publications production, and went a long way toward introducing and popularizing
                    American books in translation in Japan. I give full credit to Leon. It was an
                    imaginative approach at which he worked very hard and successfully. In the
                    process, he became reasonably proficient himself in the Japanese language. He
                    was, and still is, a highly alert and intelligent man, of wide ranging interests
                    and accomplishments.</p>
                <p>* * * * * * * * * *</p>
                <p>Two other programs, ones that are more routine to USIS operations and therefore
                    not so noticeable, were ably run in Tokyo. While Bill Hutchinson was the
                    director of Press operations in the first two years of USIS, our placement in an
                    always resistant Japanese press was good, and our publications program moved
                    along productively even though up against a growing Japanese magazine industry
                    that now probably eclipses any other in the world. Bill's successor was not as
                    imaginative or as energetic, and I believe we were less successful in this area
                    after his departure.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>the Exchange of Persons Program with Japan was unusually large. It did not
                    compare with the resources devoted to this operation in Germany, but as other
                    USIS operations go, it was large. It was supervised by Don Ranard, and was a
                    separate unit within USIS Tokyo. To this operation, among other things, can be
                    credited our getting William Faulkner for the Nagano Seminar in 1955, and the
                    American Symphony of the Air that same year. Those were the two more spectacular
                    achievements. Don's unit also cooperated extensively with the Fulbright office,
                    organizing volunteer help to assist in student counseling, giving the annual
                    Fulbright competitive examinations, and negotiating with the Japanese Government
                    for expanded exchanges. The Fulbright program today is 50% funded by the
                    Japanese Government, and although that development matured after Don's time, he
                    can be credited with having laid the groundwork for later success.</p>
                <p>Well, Allan, I think that is enough discussion on Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1956, you were transferred from Tokyo to Rio, which was
                        then the Capital of Brazil. What was it like then? You were the Deputy
                        Director and Acting Director of USIS there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: I was sent there as Deputy Director. My PAO was a man with a newspaper
                    and radio background. I don't know if he first came into the Agency as an
                    information man, or through VOA. At one time he was Program Director of the
                    Voice of America but had gotten himself integrated under the Wriston program
                    into the Department of State. His name was Jack Vebber, V-E-B-B-E-R. And then
                    although he had become an FSO State had assigned him back to USIA and there he
                    was a PAO.</p>
                <p>My experience in Brazil was relatively limited. I think you mentioned earlier I
                    managed to contract polio after I'd been down there only about seven or eight
                    months and had to come out. My rehabilitation was so long that I never got back
                    to Brazil in an official capacity.</p>
                <p>However, it was an interesting time because the Soviet Communist Party Congress
                    of 1956—I've forgotten which session it was of the USSR Communist party
                    congress—had only recently concluded. It was the occasion at which Khrushchev
                    had given his speech denouncing Stalin; when he was making his effort to get the
                    administration of the communist party out of some of its more restrictive
                    doldrums and get the country moving, an attempt by the way which ultimately
                    ended in his overthrow.</p>
                <p>But anyway, he'd given this long speech. It had been taken down by the American
                    Foreign Broadcast Service, and translated into English. We had an English copy.
                    We were fortunate in Brazil in having on our staff of locals two or three top
                    flight journalists who had come over from newspapers in Brazil to work for USIS.
                    I remember the first names of the two gentlemen so I'll refer to them as
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The senior gentleman was named Roberto and I've forgotten his last name now. And
                    the younger man who only recently retired from USIS in Brazil was Rodriguez.
                    They both were quite fluent in English and exceedingly capable people. In fact,
                    the whole Brazilian staff was almost as capable as the Japanese staff. And I
                    found that they were very high quality individuals, unusually well educated,
                    very smart and very energetic, very innovative.</p>
                <p>We went into a session shortly with Roberto whose English was perhaps a little
                    more fluent than Rodriguez. He translated the entire Khrushchev speech into
                    Portuguese. And we published it in paperback format which we managed to get into
                    a large number of the schools, universities, newspapers and magazines in
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>At that time, Brazil had a very large communist party and a fairly influential
                    one. I think to this day there is much left wing influence in Brazil despite the
                    long term administration of the Army there which only terminated a few years ago
                    after running a dictatorial government for nine or ten years. But the communist
                    influence really was effective in Brazil in my time there.</p>
                <p>This move on our part among other things triggered a rather wide scale counter
                    offensive on the part of communist sympathizers. Since a fair amount of the
                    press had leftist leanings, they were getting a lot of material into the
                    Brazilian papers. Furthermore, publications were not censored, and they had
                    their own magazines and publications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Communist Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: The Communist Party, yes. I believe that when the Army took over about
                    10 or 12 years ago they suppressed the Communist Party. And I do not know
                    whether it is once more operating as a legal party. The CIA decided that
                    something had to be done to counter this, and they orchestrated in conjunction
                    with us the rather extensive program of anti-communist posters, newspaper
                    placements, etc., exploiting the weaknesses of the Soviet government as exposed
                    by the Khrushchev speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring strictly to information activities I
                        gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Pardon?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're referring strictly to information activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: I'm referring strictly to information activities just now. And in fact,
                    during the relatively short period I was there, most of my efforts personally
                    were directed toward the information—media—side of the program.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>We did have a very large cultural center in Rio. It was one of the Binational
                    centers of which there are a great many, not only in Brazil, but all over Latin
                    America. These centers were begun originally under the Institute of
                    Inter-American affairs (IIA) that began operating as early as 1937-38 in that
                    area under the direction of Nelson Rockefeller. They were known as Binational
                    Centers, because they were designed to engage the joint participation of the
                    U.S. and host country leaders. They are directed by binational boards, composed
                    usually of equal numbers of prominent local leaders and resident Americans.</p>
                <p>I will not go into detail about them here, because John Ewing, who served with me
                    in Brazil, will later provide an interview for our oral history project in which
                    he will cover the origins and activities of these centers. John began his career
                    in the center in Mexico City shortly after WWII. When he served in Brazil, he
                    began as an officer in a single center, but later was named head of the
                    Binational center program for all of Brazil. Although there were already several
                    centers in Brazil, they had not everywhere reached the level of prominence they
                    were later to attain, and they were mostly confined to major cities. It is to
                    John Ewing that we owe their phenomenal growth in both prestige and numbers.</p>
                <p>Most of this effort took place after I was forced to leave Brazil. However, the
                    Center in Rio was already a prominent force in the community long before my
                    arrival. Many of the USIS cultural activities were staged in or through the
                    centers. This was especially true of the exchange programs—not only important
                    visitors, and exchange scholars, but also visiting performing arts groups.
                    Although USIS contributed personnel and money to their operations, they were not
                    directly part of USIA/USIS. USIS generally placed Agency-contracted personnel in
                    the centers as Center Directors, and in the larger ones, one or two other
                    similarly employed Americans as well. They were paid by the Agency, which also
                    contributed some operational funds, but the ultimate policy control had to rest
                    with the center's board. Furthermore, the centers were only partially dependent
                    on USIS financial aid. They developed much of their own operating costs through
                    an enormous English Language teaching program. John Ewing either personally, or
                    with the aid of assistants, produced most of the teaching manuals used for the
                    program throughout Latin America.</p>
                <p>But getting back to my activities jointly with the CIA, I must explain that in
                    those days there was occasional collaboration between USIS and CIA in the
                    so-called gray areas—never in the “black.” CIA had ways of getting materials
                    into certain media outlets, and had distribution channels not available to us.
                    In this particular instance we mounted a large scale effort which was supposed
                    to be choreographed pretty much by the political section of the embassy. But
                    since they didn't have experience in the case of informational operations, USIS
                    people were the ones who were putting the informational products together.</p>

                <p>The part that the political section was playing was to advise us, and keep the
                    Brazilian government advised as to what we were doing, making sure that we were
                    not going beyond the bounds of what the Brazilian government would approve. An
                    amusing situation took place during that period. Many of the old line Foreign
                    Service personnel of the State Department of that time still held the pre-war
                    and early post-war attitude toward USIA, that we were second class citizens,
                    really didn't know how to operate very well abroad and needed the guidance of
                    more sagacious foreign service people.</p>
                <p>The political counselor at that time was a man by the name of Eric Wendelyn, who
                    was a typical holder of that old view. The ambassador was—cut it a minute.</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: The ambassador was Ellis Briggs. Briggs was a very fine gentleman and he
                    was always warmly hospitable to me personally. Yet, I could always detect a
                    feeling that he somehow didn't quite trust anyone with foreign service duties
                    who hadn't come up through the old guard foreign service channels.</p>
                <p>Schmidt Named Acting PAO in Brazil: October, 1956</p>
                <p>Just before we entered fully into this cooperative venture with CIA, our PAO,
                    Jack Vebber, was suddenly called to be Deputy Chief of Mission in Guatemala.
                    Once again, on short notice, I became Acting PAO, this time in Brazil. The time
                    was somewhere near the middle of October, 1956.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were in the middle stages of planning for the joint USIA/CIA effort,
                    and so, I was asked to attend a meeting designed to discuss details. Eric
                    Wendelyn was there, along with the DCM, and the Station Chief (as the head of
                    CIA was known). He and I had become close friends. He was a well-educated man
                    who looked the part of the patrician that he was, but had no airs. He was easy
                    to know and work with. Eric started to outline the course of action to be
                    followed, then turned to me, who was orchestrating the information side of the
                    effort, and said condescendingly, “You know, of course, what we're trying to do
                    here, don't you?” I thought, well—you know I could have made a very sarcastic
                    remark, but for once figured discretion was the better part of valor, so I just
                    said, “yes, I'm quite aware of it,” and let it go at that. But that little
                    exchange illustrates the attitude many old line diplomats held toward USIS and
                    USIA.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>However, personally, we got along very well. In fact, I got along well with
                    almost everyone in the Embassy. USIS helped publicize projects such as the
                    construction of a large dam that was to be the driving power for a major
                    electrical generating plant. This was a project of the predecessor of AIDS (I
                    have forgotten by what designation it operated then), and I became a very close
                    friend of the program Director, Howard Cottam. Howard was the first Foreign
                    Service Officer to hold the double job as Counselor of Embassy for Economic
                    Affairs and Director of the AID operation in Brazil. This dual assignment was
                    tried several times in different countries later, with varying degrees of
                    success. I don't know of any such arrangement in recent times. Howard was a
                    highly capable and cooperative man, very friendly toward USIS, who often helped
                    USIA in various ways. He was a few years later America's first Ambassador to
                    Kuwait when it became an independent country. Unhappily, he died of cancer two
                    or three years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you fluent in the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: I didn't know any Portuguese when I went to Brazil. I was transferred
                    directly from Japan. I did know a fair amount of Japanese and got around pretty
                    well in Japan at that time. But Portuguese was something else again. I was
                    studying Portuguese and trying to become reasonably fluent. I had just reached
                    the point where, although I was not yet able to carry on extensive conversations
                    on important matters, I at least could carry on in ordinary social conversations
                    and get myself around satisfactorily.</p>
                <p>Polio: Back to the U.S. for Recuperation 1957</p>
                <p>Then, I was stricken with polio in January of 1957. At first they thought I would
                    recover quickly. It didn't happen that way. I was there for a month after that,
                    first in the hospital and then at my residence. Even when I was taken back
                    stateside I thought that I was going to be able to go back to Brazil. I didn't
                    know how long it was going to take to get rehabilitated. So I got back to
                    Washington, from there I was sent out to Seattle. My parents were still living
                    at that time and had returned from Alaska to Seattle. I entered the Northwest
                    Respirator Center which was in Seattle's Harborview Hospital. It was run by the
                    medical staff of the University of Washington Medical School under the direction
                    of Dr. Plum who in the intervening years by the way has moved to New York and
                    become a great authority on respiratory difficulties and related troubles,
                    paralytic difficulties, and has made himself a national reputation. He was young
                    then and just getting started.</p>
                <p>In any event, my rehabilitation, even before I could come back to work took about
                    seven or eight months, and so I never returned to Brazil. USIA had to send down
                    both a director and a deputy director finally. Johnny McKnight ultimately became
                    the PAO down there, but Steve Baldanza was sent down first as deputy PAO until
                    McKnight arrived. He and Johnny didn't get along, and Steve was subsequently
                    transferred out of Brazil.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>1957: Deputy Assistant Director, USIA, for Latin America</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, as I said, I never returned to Brazil in any official capacity.
                    When I did get back to work it was in late July or early August in 1957. At that
                    time I came back as the deputy assistant director of the U.S. Information Agency
                    for Latin America operations, and spent the next two years in Latin America
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the major issues of concern in those
                        years when you were Deputy Director? You were also the Acting Director for
                        Latin America for a period of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, the first major concern was an administrative one. Because I had
                    been the Acting Director there was no deputy when I left. So for many months
                    there was neither an acting head nor a deputy director in Brazil. For some
                    reason Frank Oram, who was my boss—Assistant Director, USIA for Latin America
                    could not make up his mind whom to appoint. Ambassador Briggs became seriously
                    annoyed because the Agency didn't get anyone down there. Even by the time I came
                    back to work in late July or early August, seven months after my departure, a
                    new PAO had not been appointed.</p>
                <p>I have mentioned that Frank Oram was the Assistant Director at that time for
                    Latin America. Frank is a wonderful, highly intelligent and personable guy but
                    he often had difficulty making up his mind. He just couldn't decide whom it was
                    that he wanted to send to Brazil. Finally, at one time Ellis Briggs became so
                    charged up over the fact that he didn't have either Director or Deputy Director
                    that he got on the phone to Washington. Those were the days when we still had
                    long distance from abroad over radio telephone, and in an effort to overcome
                    fading and static, you sometimes shouted loud enough to be heard from one end of
                    the hemisphere to the other.</p>
                <p>Arthur Larson was then Director of the Agency. He had only been in the position a
                    few months. I don't think Larson really ever fully understood the functioning of
                    USIA, and he wasn't a terribly successful director. But anyway it happened that
                    about seven o'clock p.m. Washington time when the call finally got through from
                    Ellis Briggs to Washington, phone operators couldn't rouse anybody in the
                    headquarters except in the Director's office. Arthur Larson was there, so he
                    picked up the phone.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>And I guess Ellis Briggs really let him have it. He could be very profane when
                    angry. He was not only voluble, but eloquent, eloquent both in excellent grammar
                    and in profanity. Briggs didn't know he was talking to the Director of the
                    Agency, and I don't think Arthur Larson fully focused on who was calling him.
                    According to somebody who came into the office just at that time, Arthur Larson
                    just sat there dumbfounded as Briggs went on for about five minutes with certain
                    interruptions in the transmission saying that he absolutely had to have somebody
                    down in Rio immediately. The net result was that they did get somebody down
                    there within just a couple of weeks after the phone call, after all those long
                    months of delay. That was the first major crisis that we had.</p>
                <p>The next thing that came up was that the Agency had just come around to employing
                    their earliest concepts of management by objectives. This was before the concept
                    was later perfected in academia and was instituted in all sorts of courses on
                    public administration and management in business as well as in universities.</p>
                <p>Agency management got the idea, not without some justification, that we weren't
                    being specific enough and sufficiently directed in our efforts abroad to operate
                    according to a set of objectives around which we should tailor our programs. I
                    was given the task of writing a directive as to how to develop objectives and
                    how to report on them once established. I had not done any of this myself,
                    although I had been operating in Japan setting out the directives sort of by
                    instinct. But I'd never really sat down and written any set of directives as to
                    how one should implement a program of management by objectives. I did the best I
                    could—and got out a directive telling posts how they should establish objectives
                    and tailor their annual reports around the degree of progress made in achieving
                    them.</p>
                <p>Every year, every PAO was then required to write an annual report back to
                    Washington as to what they had done in the preceding year and to what degree
                    they had made successful steps toward the achievement of their objectives. When
                    the annual reports started coming in it was then given to me to write a
                    critique, an analysis of each report. I must say that I spent a heck of a lot of
                    time in the fall of 1957 and the early winter of 1958 writing responses, because
                    we had about 24 programs in Latin America at that time, some them very small.
                    But we had some large ones too in Argentina, Brazil, Chili, Venezuela and to a
                    lesser extent in Colombia and Ecuador. The majority of them are rather small
                    because the countries are rather small. Nevertheless, each one submitted a full
                    report that had to be analyzed.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Then the Bureau of the Budget got into the act and wanted to see what we were
                    doing, so I had to submit all of my reports not only to the Agency but also to
                    the analysts over in the Bureau who were handling our program. And all the time
                    I was in the midst of this mess, I was trying to do something else. Latin
                    America always got the lean end of Budget resources, in what had already become
                    an impoverished appropriation so our Policy Officer (Eugene “Rocky” Staples) and
                    I were trying to get some kind of a non-governmental organization set up in
                    Latin America through which we could funnel some of our activities and which
                    would in part help by financing from private enterprise. Private enterprise had
                    even in those times, although not as bad as earlier, a rather unsavory
                    reputation in Latin America for having gone down there and set up big
                    businesses, particularly in extractive enterprises, such as mining of copper,
                    phosphates, tin and other metals, and literally robbed the Latin countries of
                    their natural resources, employed what amounted to slave labor and generally
                    brow beat the local populace, taking all their proceeds out of the country and
                    doing little for the benefit of the country's people.</p>
                <p>We had two or three very enlightened businesses in Latin America at that time,
                    notably Standard Oil's subsidiary. There was a gentleman called Nelson who was
                    resident in New York. He was, I believe, their top public relations man. He was
                    sympathetic to the idea of trying to work through the Business Council and
                    trying to rally businesses into helping us through business organizations
                    outside governmental lines of information dissemination, perhaps taking over and
                    financing some of our projects.</p>
                <p>I spent an awful lot of time on this effort while I was still the Deputy
                    Assistant Director, and continued later when I became the Acting Assistant
                    Director for the area. In the meantime, Andy Berding, who had been Deputy
                    Director for Policy and Plans in the Agency was called by Secretary Dulles to
                    assume an assistant secretary position in State. Sax Bradford, who had been PAO
                    in Spain since 1956, succeeded Andy. From information I was given in bits and
                    pieces, I am sure that Sax was largely responsible for the personnel shuffles
                    that soon occurred.</p>
                <p>Sax did not have a high opinion of my supervisor, Frank Oram. The next thing I
                    knew, Frank had been notified he was to be removed from the Assistant
                    Directorship, and Al Harkness, for whom Sax had developed a great liking, was to
                    succeed him as Assistant Director for Latin America. Well, Frank had had no wish
                    to leave his job, in which he was very happy, and, he thought, entrenched.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Frank became PAO to Madrid, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, but not immediately. He spent an academic year as the USIA
                    appointee to the first State Department Senior Seminar session, which then was
                    not so prestigious as it has become, but now is a competitor, and some believe
                    superior, to the National War College. I remained the Deputy Assistant Director,
                    but after about three months, the Assistant Director for Cultural Affairs was
                    transferred, and Al Harkness was again moved to replace him.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was ICA at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Schmidt Becomes Acting Assistant Director for Latin America</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, it was ICS then. So that left me. I became the Acting Assistant
                    Director of USIA for Latin America. That was, I think, early in 1958. No, I'm
                    sorry. It was late '58 and early '59. So, for about six months, I headed Latin
                    America operations. I remained there until June of 1959. The Agency then brought
                    John McKnight back from Brazil to be the Assistant Director. He arrived in July,
                    and took over the position. I reverted briefly to the Deputy position. In the
                    meantime, I had been appointed to the National War College for the academic year
                    1959-60, and left to enter there about August 20.</p>
                <p>Before finishing a brief discussion of my last half year or so in Latin America
                    affairs, I want to recount a couple other incidents involving Bradford. Not
                    infrequently after the Director's weekly staff meeting, Sax would convene a
                    smaller meeting of just the Area Directors. On the day I'm talking about, Jim
                    Hoofnagle, the then Assistant Director of USIA for Administration had spoken for
                    about five minutes on some major administrative question. I don't remember what
                    it was, but it did not involve any program matters at all. In the middle of the
                    later Area Directors session with Sax, the discussion was dealing with some
                    program decisions. Suddenly, Sax broke off and said: I just want to warn you
                    guys that you've got to watch out that the administrative types don't jump in
                    and try to take over your program work. They'll do it any time they can.</p>
                <p>Whether Hoofnagle's completely non-program remarks triggered this comment I have
                    no way of knowing. There was absolutely no reason that anyone could see why Sax
                    should suddenly out of context introduce this thought. It was another clue to
                    his anti-administrative bias, or maybe he thought, because I was there, now in a
                    program capacity, that he would reemphasize his feelings.</p>
                <p>On another occasion, in a Director's staff meeting that immediately preceded the
                    annual promotion panel meetings, some of the policies on how panels should
                    proceed were being considered. Suddenly, again, out of context, Sax remarked
                    that the panels would have to be careful about appointing some women to too high
                    a level. Then, he looked directly at me, and said, (and if my recollection is
                    correct, this an almost an exact quote) “I think you know particularly the woman
                    I mean.” Since he knew my high opinion of Pat van Delden, whereas he didn't like
                    her aggressive defense of her program positions, the reference could not have
                    been to any other woman in the Agency.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Well, in talking about organizational changes and the two incidents involving
                    Bradford, I got diverted from my discussion of the attempts to get business
                    assistance for Latin American information activities. I'll wrap that up briefly
                    now. I spent an awful lot of time and energy trying to put this idea across. I
                    never succeeded in doing it during the time I was Deputy and then Acting
                    Director for Latin America, although Mr. Nelson of Standard Oil seemed much in
                    favor of it. At one point I thought he was going to be able to swing some
                    support from certain business organizations, but it didn't work out.</p>
                <p>Later, only about a year later, the Business Council of Latin America did set up
                    a program headquartered in Venezuela, Caracas. The Council carried out a fairly
                    large number of informational type programs. Whether their program was in any
                    way stimulated by what I had been working on, I don't know. In any event, they
                    did it primarily without contact with USIA. They apparently didn't want to be
                    associated too directly with USIA. My old boss, Jack Vebber, by that time having
                    retired from the Foreign Service, was given the position of Executive Director
                    of that enterprise in Caracas. He moved down to Venezuela and headed it for
                    three or four years before he finally retired a second time and returned to his
                    old hometown just outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Jack, by the way, died just
                    about a year ago. He lived to be 84 or 85 and died I think in November of 1986.
                    But for about three or four years he was the head of that business-operated and
                    financed effort in Caracas, largely to give American business a better image on
                    things American. So I like to think those were some of the major efforts in my
                    period as Deputy Assistant Director and Acting Assistant Director for Latin
                    America.</p>
                <p>Vice President Nixon's 1958 Visit to Latin America:and the Role of “Rocky”
                    Staples in that Trip</p>
                <p>One of the other things we did during my tour in those positions was to help
                    orchestrate the visit of then Vice President Nixon to Latin America. That was
                    the famous trip he made in which he was vilified in a number of countries. Rocks
                    were thrown at him, he was spit on; he was the target of riotous attacks in Peru
                    and Venezuela.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Caracas he had a very difficult time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yeah, he had a bad time in Caracas. He also had a bad time in Lima. His
                    troubles began in Lima. He'd gotten along all right in Brazil. I was not there
                    at the time, of course. I was here in Washington. But I was one of those who
                    helped to set up some of the arrangements for Nixon when he went. The White
                    House wanted to have someone with him from USIA who spoke fluent Spanish, was
                    familiar with the Latin America media and could act as sort of his spokesman and
                    his informational assistant for any efforts in which he was involved when he was
                    dealing with people who spoke only Spanish.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>“Rocky” Staples was at that time the Policy Officer for Latin America in the
                    Office of Latin American Affairs in USIA. “Rocky” fitted that bill precisely, a
                    brash, very bright, energetic man, absolutely fearless. And his Spanish was
                    perfect. He had lived in Mexico as a UP correspondent for a number of years and
                    perfected his Spanish down there, then later served with USIS in Chile.</p>
                <p>So we detailed Rocky to be the one to accompany the Nixon party. They welcomed
                    him like a long lost brother. He was unbelievably effective on that trip. We got
                    more accolades out of “Rocky's” performance than I could have imagined. Nixon
                    was absolutely enchanted. And I will say this: although Rocky—I don't know what
                    his political affiliations were; I never was quite sure whether he was a
                    Democrat or a Republican—”Rocky” wasn't terribly fond of Nixon when he started
                    out on that trip. But he became an admirer of the Vice President because he said
                    Nixon had the mind of a sponge. He assimilated and retained masses of
                    information in very short order. He not only retained what he learned but he
                    could analyze it, come to astute conclusions, and bring it forth in arguments
                    very effectively. “Rocky” said that he gained a tremendous amount of admiration
                    for Nixon on that trip. Whatever anybody else thought about him politically he
                    was probably the smartest man in that part. He could talk to any person if
                    they'd give him a chance. His grasp and analytical usage of the information he
                    had at his fingertips, “Rocky” felt, far exceeded that of the people who were
                    running the program for the Department of State. Of course, State didn't like to
                    hear that, but that was “Rocky's” opinion. Maybe not everyone felt that way. But
                    Nixon thought “Rocky” was great. And it was a big plus for USIA.</p>
                <p>It also finally earned Rocky a special award. The Junior Chamber of Commerce
                    granted an award every year to two or three young people in government. The
                    recipients had to be young men under 40 years of age. Rocky had made such an
                    impression during the trip that I decided we should submit his name. And I'll
                    say without being too humble about it, that I wrote a damn good citation for him
                    and he got it. He was awarded the citation as the outstanding young man as far
                    as the Junior Chamber of Commerce was concerned for that year. I think it was
                    awarded in late '58.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Right now I don't know where he is. He went to language school after
                    that to study Russian. He was so good, so linguistically gifted, that at the end
                    of one year of study he rated a four plus in both spoken and written Russian.
                    His wife, Charlotte, who also had been a foreign correspondent and whom he had
                    met in Mexico during his years there with the UPI, or the UP at that time, took
                    it with him. She scored three plus each way. And she wasn't able to study as
                    intensively as he was because they still had young children at home, and she was
                    tied up a good part of the time with home duties.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>After a year here they sent him to a Garmisch Partenkirchen in Germany to study
                    Russian terminology relating to military affairs. He studied in the military
                    school there for another six months, then went on to replace Lee Brady who had
                    been our first, well, not really our first, Cultural Attach� in Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Tom” Tuch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Tom Tuch was the first USIS officer in Moscow. Although at the time he
                    was too junior to have the title of Cultural Attach� and was not allowed to
                    serve as a USIA officer. Lee Brady was the first one to be able to operate as a
                    USIS man. Lee was only there two years and then “Rocky” replaced him and was
                    there from 1962 I think until 1964—no, he must have gone in '61 because he was
                    there three years or almost three years and came back in '64. When he got back
                    in '64 he and Tuch weren't seeing eye to eye. Tuch and Brady had given “Rocky” a
                    somewhat discouraging efficiency rating. And he was pretty exercised over that
                    fact.</p>
                <p>He also had caught the eye of George Bundy who thought he was a superb performer
                    in Moscow. And so George, with his connections and his later position with the
                    Ford Foundation, advised the Ford Foundation to offer Rocky a very lucrative
                    position with them. At that time the Ford Foundation was much more influential
                    than it has been in the most recent years, and their operations were very highly
                    publicized in the U.S. I don't exactly remember what position it was that Rocky
                    got. But in the fall of 1964 he finally decided to leave USIA and go with the
                    Ford Foundation.</p>
                <p>He was with them several years in New York. Then they offered him the job of
                    going out to be the head of the Ford Foundation in India, which was, I think the
                    largest overseas foundation office they had. He was out there for almost ten
                    years. His wife Charlotte developed cancer while they were out there, and
                    although she managed to hand on for several years, she did die before he left
                    India.</p>
                <p>He came back to the States about the end of '83 or early in '84. By that time the
                    Ford Foundation top management had completely turned over. The old group was
                    out. “Rocky” felt that he really wasn't doing much and probably didn't have a
                    big future there any longer. So he resigned, and about that time was offered a
                    job as Deputy Assistant Director of AID for European Affairs—European and they
                    had part of another area—it wasn't all in Europe. I've forgotten just how
                    they're organized over there now.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Anyway, he came down to Washington and took that job. And was there in '84, '85
                    and early '86. But at the time he said, I don't know whether I want to stay in
                    government or not. Then he suddenly left, and I lost track of him. I don't know
                    where he is now. He left before Christmastime of '86, and when I wrote him our
                    usual Christmas card and greetings in '86 it came back saying he was no longer
                    resident at his D.C. address. I haven't been able to find out where he went.</p>
                <p>1960: Schmidt Named Assistant Director/USIA for Administration</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to your career after the year at the National
                        War College, you were named Assistant Director of the Agency for
                        Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was a time when the Kennedy transition team
                        landed on the Agency. Would you tell us about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, the first several months I was head of administration—from July to
                    December, 1960, George Allen was still Director. Kennedy was elected in
                    November, and the transition team arrived shortly afterwards. I will come to
                    that part of the story a little later. I didn't want the job as Assistant
                    Director for Administration. I'd pretty well gotten out of administration, and I
                    didn't want to get back into it again. I was going to the National War College.
                    When I first left to go to the War College I went up to see George Allen who was
                    then the Director of USIA. He agreed that when I got out of the War College that
                    I could go to Spanish language training and be made PAO in Mexico City.</p>
                <p>That was something I wanted very much to do at that time. So once I had that
                    agreement I thought things were going to be fine. I would come out of the War
                    College and get my Spanish language training. I thought my Portuguese, as little
                    as I'd had of it might help me, then I could really consolidate my Spanish.</p>
                <p>Along about the end of February or the first of March of that year 1960—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, I went into the War College in August of '59. And I was in the War
                    College 1959-1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Along about the end of February or the first part of March of 1960, I
                    got a call from George Allen saying he wanted me to come up and see him. So I
                    took the afternoon off from War College and I went up to his office. I walked
                    into his office—no one ever called Mr. Allen by his first name. He was always
                    Mr. Allen. You never called him George like you could call Ed Murrow, Ed, or
                    Carl Rowan, Carl—so I just said Hello, Mr. Allen.</p>
                <p>He said, sit down, Lew. So I sat down. He didn't say anything for about two
                    minutes. I was beginning to get a little nervous. He said, how would you like to
                    be the Assistant Director for Administration? I said, well, Mr. Allen, I feel
                    it's quite an honor. But, you know, you had promised me that I could be PAO in
                    Mexico. And I said I really prefer to go to Mexico since I've been out of the
                    field now for some time because of my bout with polio. Also I said, if I thought
                    you were going to stay on I'd feel much better about it. Besides, I don't know
                    who might replace you, but you and I both know that the Eisenhower
                    Administration is drawing to a close and that there's going to be a new
                    president at least come next January. I don't know whether it's to be a
                    Republican or a Democrat, but in either case it's going to be a total change in
                    practically all the top offices. And I don't imagine you will be here after
                    that. Absolute silence from Allen.</p>
                <p>And I said, therefore, I really wish you would let me escape from that job, not
                    take it. He just sat there for a while, then swiveled around in his chair and
                    looked out the window for what seemed to me several minutes, though it probably
                    was not over a minute. Then he said, “Yes, Lew. There's no doubt. You're the man
                    to be the Assistant Director for Administration. Jim Hoofnagle, who had had that
                    position, had just been named PAO in Germany. He was taking off for Germany in
                    two or three months. I guess they were going to put him through German for three
                    months, three or four months first. But in any event the job was coming open.
                    Since I would be out the first week in June from the War College he felt the
                    timing was right and I was the one who should take it. Well, one didn't say no
                    to Mr. Allen when he put it that way. And I came on as Assistant Director for
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>In retrospect I think it turned out to be one of the most fortunate experiences
                    in my career, because I couldn't have foreseen the fact that Ed Murrow would
                    become the Director of USIA and would give me the opportunity to be both an
                    administrative managerial person and a deep participant in program operations as
                    he did. Nor would I have had the good fortune to have been so closely associated
                    with a man whom I still consider to be one of the greatest Americans that ever
                    lived. I'm a great admirer of Ed's. I think he was a tremendous man. And I
                    wouldn't give up anything the nearly three years that I had while he was still
                    well and able to manage the Agency.</p>
                <p>In any event I came aboard. But before I actually went to work at the job, I had
                    to have an operation myself which kept me out for several weeks. I finally took
                    over effectively about the middle of July after convalescing for about four
                    weeks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes. Mid-July or late July of 1960. I was very fortunate in that my
                    Deputy Director was Irv Schwartz who was an exceptionally sharp and capable man,
                    an absolute whiz at budget work. And, of course, Ben Posner was the chief of the
                    budget division. We had two of the best budget and fiscal people in the whole
                    government in my estimation in that work, and I was heavily supported by both of
                    them. It turned out to be a sad situation: Irv became progressively ill after we
                    were together only about three months. I think he was only about 45 or 46 years
                    of age, but he had developed liver cancer which had progressed very rapidly. He
                    died within a week, within about two weeks after the electoral victory of John
                    Kennedy as President. So I lost a very valued assistant and a very good friend.
                    I've regretted that loss ever since. Later I was able to persuade Ed Murrow to
                    move Ben Posner up to be my deputy. And, of course, Ben was a superb performer
                    also. He was an excellent replacement for Irv. But I deeply regretted his
                    death.</p>
                <p>I suppose that the first thing that we—I really can't remember all the projects
                    that we started. But we were about to embark on a very large number of new
                    projects both administratively and program wise. Personnel was then under my
                    jurisdiction and we were undertaking a complete revision of personnel
                    regulations. We were also called upon to reformulate to some extent the nature
                    of the budget presentation. There was another operation which we were going to
                    revise but it escapes my memory at this moment. Anyhow, we began work
                    immediately on these projects.</p>
                <p>We were in the late summer and fall of 1960. At that time Tom Sorensen had not
                    yet appeared on the scene. He was an officer, a rather middle grade officer in
                    USIS at the time. I don't know whether he was around Washington at that time or
                    whether he was still overseas. He had studied Arabic and had been serving abroad
                    somewhere in the North African area, perhaps in Egypt although I'm not sure of
                    that. I didn't meet him until right after Ed Murrow came in as the Director of
                    the Agency and Tom was pulled up to be the Deputy Director for policy and plans.
                    That was March 6, 1961.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>During the late months of George Allen's incumbency, Sax Bradford was still the
                    Deputy Director for Policy and Plans, which was Tom's job later, and which was
                    then the number three position in the Agency. He had come back from Spain and
                    had taken that position while I was still in the Latin American area. And he was
                    going to be seconded over to the State Department about the time that I came out
                    of the War College. He was going over to CU in State in some rather high
                    position over there. I don't think he was the Director of CU but he might have
                    been the deputy. Anyway, it was a fairly substantial position. And that left a
                    vacancy up there. Bernie Anderson was in the Policy and Plans office—whether he
                    was the actual deputy as he later became, I don't recall. If he wasn't he later
                    became that under Tom Sorensen.</p>
                <p>Also I was very fortunate in that L.K. Little had been the Director of Personnel.
                    He was ready to retire a second time, his earlier career having been for years
                    the Director of the Chinese Government's Customs Service, a position he left
                    because of the communist takeover in 1949.</p>
                <p>Fairly early on after the Agency became independent, he came over to be the
                    Agency's Director of Personnel. A man by the name of Dick Cook was then the
                    Assistant Director for Administration, and it was he who brought L.K. in as
                    Director of Personnel. L.K. was retiring finally after several years in that
                    position about the time that I came aboard as Assistant Director for
                    Administration.</p>
                <p>L.K. was a great admirer, as were a number of other people, of Bill Weathersby.
                    Now, Bill had just been told that he was going to go off to India. I don't
                    remember whether he was going to be Deputy PAO or PAO at that time. He was very
                    reluctant to take the job. He didn't want to come into the administrative area
                    and he wanted to go abroad. But L.K. persuaded him to come on. And he got Don
                    Wilson—no, at that time, not Don Wilson. He got George Allen to promise that
                    after two years Bill could go out to the field, and could name his own post to
                    go abroad.</p>
                <p>Bill reluctantly agreed to stay for two years. At the time Bill was Director of
                    Personnel it was still part of the Office of Administration. It hadn't been
                    separated as it was after I left four years later, and became an independent
                    organization for about five or six years. Now it's back again under
                    Administration's management.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>At the urging of Henry Loomis, we brought Lionel (”Mose”) Mosley up from VOA to
                    be Deputy Director of Personnel. Bill and I both decided that the restrictions
                    in regulations governing of what people could or could not do on home leave and
                    what they could do about transportation to and from their field posts and a lot
                    of other things were unduly restrictive and that they really were prejudicial to
                    the best interest of the Foreign Service officers coming in on home leave. So we
                    launched a real program to try and get that changed. We rewrote pretty
                    extensively the personnel regulations making them much more liberal in what you
                    could do when you came in, in treating people who were on home leave, extending
                    their leave for extenuating circumstances or giving them special breaks if for
                    some reason or other they were called back to their post earlier than they had
                    to be than they would have gone and to cut short their home leave. And there
                    were a number of other things that we wrote into the regulations which should
                    and to some extent did facilitate the role of foreign service officers.</p>
                <p>I found out later that some of the people in personnel undercut those regulations
                    after Bill Weathersby had gone on out to India. But that's another story. They
                    had continued to insist upon the old regulations. I found out about this some
                    six or seven years later when I was inspecting Paris and ran into the press
                    attach� who had been the victim of one of those misinterpretations.</p>
                <p>When Kennedy was elected President, Mr. Allen promptly resigned. He had been
                    given an opportunity to be the executive head of the Tobacco Institute. A lot of
                    people were rather disappointed that he would take that position where he had to
                    be sort of a huckster for the tobacco industry. Because Allen had always been a
                    man of considerable principle. And they felt he was perhaps denigrating some of
                    his own scruples in taking a position. But he took it. I guess it was a very
                    lucrative one. And he served in it for a number of years before he retired a
                    second time, went back to his home state of North Carolina.</p>
                <p>The Kennedy Transition Period: Abbott Washburn Becomes Acting Director and
                    Schmidt Acting Deputy Director of USIA</p>
                <p>In any event he left almost immediately. I don't think more than a week or two
                    after the election of Kennedy. That meant that there was no director. We knew
                    that there wasn't going to be any director appointed until a new president came
                    in, and probably not for some time thereafter, given the usual delays of filling
                    jobs when a new administration assumes office.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Abbott Washburn then took over as Director of the Agency. I don't know whether
                    Abbott would have named me or not. I never asked him. He might or might not have
                    wanted to do it. But George Allen as almost his last act before he left, issued
                    an order within the agency that I would be the Acting Deputy Director until the
                    Kennedy transition team took over. I was the Acting Deputy Director, and Abbott
                    stayed on as Acting Director until about two weeks before Ed Murrow came in. I
                    was never designated the Acting Director of the Agency although Abbott was gone
                    most of that time the last two weeks. I remained the Acting Deputy Director
                    until Ed Murrow came in. Don Wilson, who had been the head of the transition
                    team at USIA for the Kennedy Administration was nominated by Kennedy to be the
                    Deputy Director, and I reverted to my regular status.</p>
                <p>So I was the Acting Deputy Director of the Agency for the latter part of
                    November, December, January and most of February, I guess all of February. I
                    think Ed didn't come in until about the first week in March because Kennedy had
                    had a hard time persuading him to take the job. I am told although Ed never told
                    me, somebody else did, that President Kennedy offered Ed the job almost as soon
                    as he was inaugurated. Ed at that time did not take it. So meanwhile, two or
                    three other people were under consideration. I don't know whether any of
                    them—Josephus Daniels was one—turned it down. I think Daniels probably did.
                    There was someone else who was considered. I can't remember who it was. And I'm
                    not sure whether he rejected the offer or whether for some reason or other
                    Kennedy decided not to ask him to accept.</p>
                <p>Edward R. Murrow Becomes Director of USIS</p>
                <p>Finally, towards the end of February Abbott called me up at home one Saturday and
                    said, we have a new director subject only to Congressional confirmation. And I
                    don't think we'll have any trouble. So I asked him who it was and he said, well,
                    I can't tell you now until it's officially announced. But he said, you'll like
                    him and he will be a great plus for the Agency.</p>
                <p>The rumor began to get around the following Monday that it was Ed Murrow although
                    nobody would confirm it. I think we had our first meeting, first director's
                    meeting with Ed Murrow the day he arrived. Abbott Washburn brought him in,
                    although he had left the Agency by then. He brought Ed Murrow in and introduced
                    him, and, of course, that confirmed the rumor. Everybody was ecstatic about the
                    appointment. As I recall, that was about the first week in March, although I
                    can't be absolutely sure. My memory's not firm on that point.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I had been working very closely with Don Wilson. By that time I
                    was thoroughly familiar with all the internal operations of the Agency which, of
                    course, Don was only beginning to learn. So I was actually Don's principal
                    advisor on how things were being handled in the Agency, how each Agency elements
                    interacted with the other, some of the problems that existed, some of the things
                    that in my estimation at least I felt ought to be changed.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>During the time that I was Acting Deputy Director I had also been engaged in a
                    number of problems that the Director and Deputy Director normally would have
                    handled, but if you asked me now what they were I would have a hard time
                    explaining what they were.</p>
                <p>So, as soon as Don knew that Ed was to be appointed Don asked me to write a
                    complete analysis of all the major programs in which the Agency was involved,
                    what the major difficulties were, what progress was being made on their
                    implementation and some recommendations as to where I thought they ought to go.
                    I spent almost, I'd say, 80 or 90 percent of my time the last month before Ed
                    Murrow came in, in writing that analysis which I gave to Don about the time that
                    Ed came aboard. It became to a large extent the initial blueprint out of which
                    they operated.</p>
                <p>A few days after Ed officially became Director, I was sitting in Ed's outer
                    office. Marian Anderson had been waiting to see Ed when I came in. It was the
                    first time I'd ever seen her in person except from a great distance at Easter of
                    1939 when she sang from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. She was sitting in
                    the outer office. I sat down along with Jim Halsema, facing her. She was a most
                    gracious lady. She didn't say anything while we were sitting there and I didn't
                    really feel that I was called upon to go up and introduce myself. But she had
                    the appearance of a very self composed, great and gracious woman.</p>
                <p>Well, in a few minutes Ed Murrow came out of his office. Of course, he knew her
                    very well. He went over and said, how are you Marian and shook hands. Then he
                    introduced us to her and took her into his office. We sat there again for a
                    while waiting, not too long. I don't think she was in there more than 15 minutes
                    before she came out. About that time a young man entered and without stopping
                    went right into Ed's office. That turned out to be Tom Sorensen. It was the
                    first time I'd ever seen him. Jim and I sat there for another ten or fifteen
                    minutes., then Tom emerged, didn't say anything to either of us, just walked out
                    into the hall.</p>
                <p>Halsema looked at me and said, our new Deputy Director for Policy and Plans? He
                    apparently had heard a rumor. I hadn't. But that turned out to be what it was.
                    In those days that position didn't require a Congressional confirmation. Tom was
                    a very capable guy, but I'm sure that he was plucked out of his middle grade
                    level in the Agency and given that position, one of the top three or four jobs
                    in the Agency, only because his brother, Ted, was top White House Assistant to
                    Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side 1 of Tape 3 of an interview with G. Lewis
                        Schmidt being conducted at his home in McLean, Virginia on February 18,
                        1988. It is a continuation of an interview begun on February 8th. The
                        interviewer is Allen Hansen. Lew, we were talking about Tom Sorensen coming
                        on board as one of the new Deputy Directors, or as the Deputy Director,
                        Policy and Plans, under Ed Murrow. And Ed Murrow had just arrived I think.
                        Can you tell us about that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, Ed had arrived a few days before this incident occurred in which
                    Jim Halsema and I were sitting in the outer office when Tom was being
                    interviewed by Ed and came out of his office. It did transpire actually that Tom
                    because the Deputy Director for Policy and Plans. He stayed in that position all
                    through Ed's incumbency and for some period thereafter when Ed had left the
                    Agency because of health. There were many times in which Tom's incumbency in
                    that position resulted in some rather controversial matters.</p>
                <p>I will come back to that a little later. But I'd like to say a few words about Ed
                    Murrow and about what he meant to the Agency. I think that Ed's accession to the
                    job as Director of the USIA was undoubtedly the high point of the U.S.
                    Information Agency existence. He brought to us a prestige and acceptability
                    which we had not really had before. He was such a national personality that he
                    immediately was accepted and the Agency was accepted with him.</p>
                <p>In addition to that fact, Ed had the confidence of the White House. He had a
                    direct hot line—not immediately upon assuming office but shortly thereafter,
                    permitting him to pick up his phone and talk immediately to Kennedy and the
                    White House. At that time also Chester Bowles was the Under Secretary of State.
                    Ed had known Chester for a long time and they were very close friends, so that
                    gave us an entree into the State Department which we had never had before. Also,
                    it gave us a new leg up on our prestige over there.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that Ed did was to ask me to stay on as Assistant
                    Director for Administration. It was very flattering to me. It opened up a new
                    career possibility to me in the Agency, because Ed felt that my long experience
                    in USIA, both overseas and in the Agency, gave me an insight into how things
                    operated which he in those early days did not have.</p>
                <p>As a result, I was given a great deal more to do both in program fields as well
                    as in the administrative area than perhaps any other assistant director in that
                    position had previously enjoyed. It was, therefore, as I say, a very important
                    time to me.</p>
                <p>The influence of Ed first became noticeable on the Hill. It was a time when we
                    were preparing for our fiscal year 1963 budget hearings. Ed had made up his mind
                    that he was going to sit through the entire hearings on the Hill. We had some
                    rather tough customers with which to deal. I'm sure much has been said elsewhere
                    about Mr. Rooney who was the chairman of the Subcommittee in the House of
                    Representatives that heard our appropriation justification. In the past,
                    usually, the Director had only gone up the first day or two and then had left
                    the balance of the hearings to the people in each case who handled the
                    particular section of the agency that was being discussed that day.</p>
                <p>Instead Ed went up in person. The attitude of Rooney was entirely different than
                    it had been with other directors and with individuals who went before him. He
                    treated Ed with a considerable degree of respect and attention, and we were
                    spared quite a bit of the hassling and harassment that we usually experienced on
                    the Hill.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, it didn't result in very much of an increase in our appropriation.
                    Ed had made a very strong appeal for an increase. Rooney, however, played his
                    usual role, i.e., that of being very parsimonious with these civil servants or
                    with these people in the executive branch who were trying, in his words, to
                    overspend. We ended up, therefore, with a very small increase in the
                    appropriation, and Ed was quite disappointed. In fact, he was disappointed
                    through his entire career, because he was unable to bridge that gap.</p>
                <p>Then I'd like to go forward just a moment to mention our appropriation hearings
                    in the Senate. In the Senate the Chairman of our subcommittee was McClellan of
                    Arkansas. But the principal man, the ranking man behind him on the Democratic
                    side was Senator Ellender. Ellender had a particular dislike for the U.S.
                    Information Agency. He felt the whole program was nothing but a boondoggle. He
                    told us frequently that our entire effort in Europe was unnecessary. I recall
                    now, that when I was Acting PAO in Japan, Ellender had visited Tokyo. The head
                    of each Embassy Section was scheduled to appear for a one on one “chat” with the
                    old curmudgeon. When my turn came, he looked at me as I entered and,
                    paraphrased, said: Well, young man, so you represent USIA. I want you to know
                    before we start that I don't believe in your Agency. I think the whole damn
                    Agency is useless.—A complete waste of taxpayers' money. Now you sit down and
                    tell me what you're doing out here. A nice guy to deal with.</p>
                <p>I remember on one occasion in which Murrow faced him in the appropriation
                    hearings. We were talking at that point about the multilateral force agreement.
                    In other words, the offer to the European governments of a multilateral role in
                    the utilization of atomic weapons. The Kennedy Administration was urging NATO
                    nations to set up a multilateral force to handle the atomic weapons. There was
                    considerable opposition to it both in Europe and in places outside the Executive
                    Branch in the United States. It was particularly non-saleable to Europe.</p>
                <p>Ed made the point that we had been able to do some effective work in the
                    information media in Europe in getting this idea across and getting some degree
                    of public acceptance. Ellender refused to believe it. He said, oh, no. Come on,
                    Mr. Murrow. You don't mean to tell me that we had anything to do with it, USIA
                    had anything to do with acceptance of any policies that the U.S. government was
                    trying to institute in Europe. You just can't make me believe that. I've never
                    seen Ed quite so angry before nor did I see him as angry since. There was a
                    pause of about 30 seconds which was a very pregnant silence. And then he said,
                    Mr. Senator, I meant to say precisely what I said. And I will not accept your
                    evaluation that this was a useless effort. We have had influence. There is
                    evidence to show it. It was the only time I ever saw Ellender shut up.</p>
                <p>On our way back up to the USIA officer a few of us were in the car with Ed riding
                    back. He said, “Well, gentlemen. I draw one conclusion from my hearings this
                    morning, and that is that the pigs shall inherit the earth.”</p>

                <p>Episodes Involving Lyndon Johnson</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: I think that rather than try to cover in sequence everything that went
                    on during the Murrow administration, I would like to cite what I consider to be
                    some highlights.</p>
                <p>Early the first significant one came up when Lyndon Johnson who was then Vice
                    President made his famous trip around the world. He visited a great many of the
                    far eastern countries, got over into the Middle East and even made a stop or two
                    in Europe before he returned. When he came back he was very critical of USIA. He
                    felt that he had not been given adequate coverage by the members of the USIS
                    operations abroad. Shortly after his return he was scheduled to speak at the
                    National Press Club. Of course, Ed went over to listen to him.</p>
                <p>Before the luncheon started, Ed happened to be going down the corridor in the
                    Press Club and encountered Lyndon Johnson coming up the corridor in the other
                    direction. They met about midpoint and Johnson immediately grabbed Ed by the
                    lapels and pushed him up against the wall of the corridor.</p>
                <p>He said, I just want you to know that your (expletive deleted) operatives abroad
                    are lousy. They didn't give me any kind of adequate coverage. They often left me
                    when they were supposed to be photographing me. And there were times when I was
                    giving out interviews or statements when they weren't there.</p>
                <p>Ed said, Mr. Vice President, the times that they failed to cover you were times
                    when there were other significant things that were going on and when you were
                    not doing anything that was especially important. My people are not abroad to
                    cover a President or a Vice President exclusively. They are there to do the
                    types of things that are necessary to give the best impressions of the United
                    States to the host country. I have evidence that you were covered in any
                    important event. And I will not accept your criticism of the USIS personnel.</p>
                <p>Johnson never forgot that as he never forgot a lot of other things. His pique was
                    most petty. At the time later when Ed was dying of cancer, had to resign from
                    the U.S. Information Agency, and wanted to leave town, he sent his written
                    resignation sometime in November, 1963, to Lyndon Johnson who by that time, of
                    course had acceded to the presidency following the assassination of John
                    Kennedy. Johnson refused to acknowledge his resignation. He wouldn't either
                    reject it or accept it. He just let it lie without comment.</p>
                <p>The resignation had been submitted in November of 1963. In late January of 1964
                    there was still no word from the White House. Ed had made arrangements to leave
                    Washington. He was still nominally Director because his resignation had not been
                    accepted. He had made plane reservations to leave Washington on I think the 24th
                    of January. He was headed for LaJolla, where he was going to stay with Jonas
                    Salk the man who was the discoverer of the first polio vaccine, and try to rest
                    up. He hoped then to recover from his difficulties.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Finally on the 23rd when he hadn't received any notice from Johnson, he had to
                    call the White House. Johnson would not speak to him. But as a result of that
                    phone call the next morning Johnson issued a one-sentence statement to the
                    press. I don't recall the exact wording, but it was simply a very cursory one,
                    no expression of regret that he was leaving, simply a one line acceptance of the
                    resignation. And that's the way that Ed Murrow was forced to leave the
                    administration, largely because of the antipathy and vindictiveness that Johnson
                    had carried in his mind as a result of that earlier meeting, some 2-1/2 years
                    before in the press club.</p>
                <p>I had a personal brush with the Johnson contingent. When Johnson came back from a
                    trip, he was always extremely demanding. One Friday afternoon I happened to be
                    in my Agency office when practically everyone else had gone home. It was about
                    seven o'clock in the evening and nobody else was there to answer the phone. So
                    the phone which apparently rang first in Ed's office with no answer was
                    transferred to my office and I picked up the line.</p>
                <p>It was a colonel whose name I don't recall but who was the military advisor and
                    personal secretary at that time to Johnson as Vice President. He asked to whom
                    he was speaking and I told him. And he said, have you guys got the clippings
                    from abroad? I said, no that we didn't. The Vice President had been back less
                    than a week, and it took a little time for things to get in through the mails
                    and pouch. He said, by Monday morning the Vice President wants at least one copy
                    of every article that was written about him at every post that he went to. Where
                    the articles are in a foreign language he wants them translated and appended to
                    the foreign language copies. In addition to that he wants copies of every
                    picture that was taken of him either by the military photographer or by the USIS
                    photographers abroad. We want those pictures no later than the end of next week,
                    and we want the press stories by next Monday.</p>
                <p>I said, Colonel, that is utterly impossible. We don't even have them yet here.
                    And they're not very likely to be in for ten days or two weeks. When we get them
                    if you want a translation, each one is going to have to be translated. And that
                    takes time. They're undoubtedly hundreds of stories.</p>
                <p>I'm sorry, but the Vice President insists that he have them next week. Whereupon
                    he hung up the phone. I won't go into all the details of this absurdity. But
                    I'll say that we were constantly harassed. And I kept telling him when he would
                    call, which was about every other day, that we were working on it but we didn't
                    have it yet. He finally started calling Ed and other people in the front
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the colonel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: This was the colonel. Insisting that they give him what he had asked
                    for. We couldn't do it of course within the time frame that he wanted. In the
                    last analysis we got most of the articles. We did translate those that were in
                    foreign language when they came in and got them over to him. But as for the
                    pictures we discovered that somewhere in the neighborhood of six to seven
                    thousand photos had been taken.</p>
                <p>At last the Vice President agreed that if we would get all those photos, make a
                    selection of the best hundred or two in USIA, and put them in a leather bound
                    volume for them he would accept that arrangement. But he wanted to look at those
                    selected before he fully agreed.</p>
                <p>So after about two months our photo staff had gone through all six or seven
                    thousand photographs that had been taken and made a painstaking selection. They
                    mounted the chosen photos very beautifully in a leather bound volume, embossed
                    the volume in gold and sent it over to him.</p>
                <p>Within 24 hours USIA got another call back. This time I think from the Vice
                    President himself although I can't be sure because I'm not the person who
                    answered the phone. He wanted 20 of them exactly the same because he wanted to
                    make a presentation of one to the head of each nation that he had visited. USIA
                    was forced to foot the bill of getting an additional nineteen copies of this
                    volume and sending them over to him. I have no idea precisely what the cost was.
                    But it must have run into several thousand dollars. Of course, there was no
                    offer from the White House to meet the bills.</p>
                <p>Incidents Involving Senator Ellender</p>
                <p>Another significant series of events that I would like to record have to do with
                    some of our additional hearings on the Hill. Whenever Ed showed up anywhere in
                    public there was always a train of people that formed after him. We would, as he
                    passed, look back and you could see the immediate conversation going on. “My
                    God, that's Ed Murrow. Look at that.”</p>
                <p>Well, we entered the Senate side of the Capitol one afternoon for the Senate
                    hearings. In the hallway was a rather unattractive woman of indeterminate age
                    who stood off in one of the little niches in the wall. Ben Posner and I were on
                    either side of Ed as we came up the hallway headed for the hearing room. This
                    woman stood there looking like a vulture. I think the nearest description I can
                    give of how she appeared is one that will be familiar to anyone who reads the
                    comic strip, “Peanuts,” when Snoopy the dog sits up in a tree and pretends that
                    he's a vulture scowling down on the people below. That's about the way she
                    looked.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Well, it turned out that she was a former mistress of this “famous” Senator
                    Ellender. About a year before he had sent her on an around the world trip
                    ostensibly to make an investigation of how USIS was operating overseas. She got
                    very bad press from everyone. In one instance she had an encounter with a young
                    Thai in a hotel room in Thailand in which she allegedly enticed him to the room
                    and, according to him later, made sexual overtures to him. Well, Time Magazine
                    got that story because the then PAO happened to recount it over drinks one
                    evening in one of the hotel barrooms, and the story appeared in Time
                    Magazine.</p>
                <p>Senator Ellender immediately hit the roof. He demanded that the Agency give him
                    copies of every account that had come in from Thailand about this woman's visit,
                    that we repudiate the story, that we name the person who gave the information to
                    the Time interviewer and otherwise that we come up and publicly submit ourselves
                    to a hearing on this incident.</p>
                <p>Well, Ben Posner was the one who was in custody of these reports, so he was the
                    one that Ellender got on the phone. That was the reason that the woman was in
                    the wall niche on the occasion of our trip down the hall to the hearing room.
                    She blamed Ben for holding out and failing to give Ellender the reports that he
                    wanted. Ellender tried to bring this up in the hearings, but it became so
                    embarrassing to the rest of the Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate that
                    finally McClellan, who was the chairman said, now, just a moment, gentlemen. I
                    think that we had better remove this last exchange from the record. I don't
                    think this is an appropriate subject for a hearing on the budget of the U.S.
                    Information Agency, and we will delete it when the text is up for editing. That
                    shut Ellender up. But it shows you the extent to which this man would go to
                    embarrass the Agency and generally to put us in a bad light. The thing finally
                    simmered down over the next year or so. But it was a bad time for the
                    Agency.</p>
                <p>The first thing that Ed set out to do after he came into the Agency was, to the
                    extent to which he could do so, start building a reputation for the Agency's
                    accomplishments abroad. He allowed himself to be questioned, to be interviewed.
                    He gave out innumerable statements. And he instituted a number of new ideas on
                    how things should be handled. Above all, as I said, he had this rapport with the
                    White House and with the State Department and immediately raised our prestige
                    there.</p>
                <p>The Latin American PAO Conferences of 1961</p>
                <p>He also wanted to get to know the USIS personnel abroad. So in the early fall of
                    1961 which was his first year in the Agency, he set up two public affairs
                    officers conferences in Latin America which he attended and which he persuaded
                    Chester Bowles, who was still at that time the Under Secretary of State, to
                    attend.</p>
                <p>The first was in Lima attended by all the public affairs officers from the South
                    American countries. The second one was in Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica,
                    where he had all the public affairs officers from the Central American
                    countries, Mexico and the Caribbean countries.</p>

                <p>In Latin America he was quite a well-known personality too, so the Agency got
                    lots of excellent publicity there. One of the incidents that arose that was
                    interesting and amusing at the first conference which was in Lima resulted from
                    the fact that in addition to having the persons I've already mentioned, we also
                    had young Mr. Symington, the son of then Senator Symington of Missouri. Young
                    Jim was subsequently himself elected to Congress in later years. But at that
                    time he was as a very young man, one of the regional directors of the Food for
                    Peace Program.</p>
                <p>Also in attendance was Carl Rowan who at that time was the Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Public Affairs but who later became the Director of the Agency after
                    the resignation of Ed Murrow.</p>
                <p>Symington wanted some time on the agenda in his capacity of an officer in the
                    Food for Peace Program. He gave a very emotionally impassioned plea for what we
                    could with Food for Peace. One of his pitches was that the Food for Peace
                    Program had devised a means of making a very high protein meal out of ground
                    fish, and also adding a flour made from soybeans that was equally nutritious.
                    According to Symington, we (the U.S.) had been able to bring that product to
                    Pakistan and feed thousands if not millions of poor people, giving them a proper
                    diet—and also much to the Pakistan Army, thus enhancing their ability to
                    discharge their military duties.</p>
                <p>Well, the plea got so emotional that finally Chester Bowles felt young Symington
                    was taking far too much time and becoming embarrassingly emotional. So he
                    managed to damp him down and get him off the air as it were.</p>
                <p>Sy Nadler who at that time was the PAO in Buenos Aires and was attending the
                    conference slipped me a note containing a little poetic verse which I remember
                    to this day. He wrote, “Western civilization has surmounted its darkest hour,
                    saved by the meal of the fish, and the beans converted to flour.” Murrow had
                    several less than complimentary comments about that particular episode. As
                    usual, he won over practically all the people who were attending from Latin
                    America and made a great impression especially on the local employees. We moved
                    on, stopping in Quito, Ecuador where Maurice Bernbaum was then ambassador, then
                    on to Panama, Colombia, and ultimately to Costa Rica where we had the second
                    conference. Much the same thing was repeated there. Everywhere we went he spoke
                    to the embassies, again, winning prestige for the Agency. I'll come back now.
                    Let's pause a moment.</p>
                <p>Frictions With Tom Sorensen</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: I mentioned earlier that Tom Sorensen was from time to time a rather
                    controversial figure in the Agency. There were a number of people who didn't
                    like what he was doing, who felt that he was being overbearing and arrogant in
                    the administration of his area in program operation. On occasion there were even
                    caustic exchanges between him and Don Wilson.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>The battles between him and the Voice, the VOA, were particularly acute. I'm sure
                    that most any reader of these remarks who has been with USIA will recognize that
                    there has always been a certain amount of friction between VOA and the policy
                    directives, both from the State Department and from the Agency. The Voice feels
                    that it is essentially a news organization and that it should not be unduly
                    inhibited in telling the news as it sees it. It concedes that it should
                    certainly exert caution—that it should follow the usual journalistic practice of
                    getting two clear confirmations of the story before it puts it on he air. But
                    having done so, having confirmed a story from reliable sources, it ought to be
                    able to broadcast the story without regard to government policy sensitivities,
                    as it would if it were any other news agency of credible nature.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the policy people have felt, I think less from USIA than from
                    the State, but even to a certain extent from USIA, that they ought to be able to
                    screen out or tone down anything being broadcast by the Voice of America that
                    impinges unfavorably in the U.S. image, because people accept it abroad as the
                    authoritative voice of our country and government. Anything which reflected too
                    adversely on the U.S. they should at least shape in such a way that it came
                    across strained through the oversight of policy direction.</p>
                <p>Tom Sorensen particularly felt this way. He wanted to put his policy stamp on the
                    Voice. As a result, there were some real pitched battles between Henry Loomis
                    who was at that time the Director of the Voice and his people down there and
                    Sorensen. I don't think the disagreement was ever completely resolved. It
                    reached a point on two or three occasions when the Director of the Voice and or
                    other representatives of the Voice came up and put their pleas to Ed, claiming
                    that they were being unduly inhibited. Ed tried to mediate these differences. To
                    some extent he was successful in doing so, but never completely.</p>
                <p>Later, when Ed had had to undergo his surgery for lung cancer and had to all
                    intents and purposes left the real direction of USIA to his deputies, the
                    difficulty between the Voice and Tom flared anew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Henry Loomis the Director of the Voice at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, he stayed on during the—at least during a substantial part of
                    Murrow's incumbency. Henry was VOA Director at the time Murrow came in, having
                    been appointed to the position by George Allen when Allen was Director. In those
                    days, Senate confirmation was not required for any USIA officer but the Director
                    and the first Deputy Director.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>All of us who were Assistant Directors of the Agency felt Henry should remain as
                    VOA head. So a few of us talked to Don Wilson about it while he was still
                    heading the Transition for the Kennedy Administration. This laid the groundwork,
                    and when Don became Deputy to Ed, he was influential in getting Ed's and
                    eventually the Administration's approval for Henry to stay. I don't recall
                    exactly the date of Henry's departure, but I think he did not leave until after
                    Ed himself had left, at which time he left to become President of the
                    Corporation for Public Broadcasting.</p>
                <p>The frictions that existed between Tom and VOA personnel was representative of
                    difficulties with other Agency elements. One particular obsession with Tom was
                    prejudice against the European program. I sometimes thought he challenged even
                    the necessity of the Agency's European operations. The dislike approached a
                    vendetta, and included not only the program itself, but some of the officers in
                    it. He felt that European posts were (a) over-staffed, (b) over indulged
                    financially, and (c) that certain officers serving in Europe had become so
                    entrenched in their posts—so smug in their continued European sophistication
                    that they had become effete and elitist. He was determined that they should be
                    moved to other more difficult areas where, he felt, they would probably fail to
                    perform with the same excellence they seemed to exhibit in Europe.</p>
                <p>Parenthetically, it is my opinion that Ed shared a little of the feeling that
                    Europe was over-blessed, and should be cut back, though not emasculated. I think
                    he felt the German operation especially was a bit bloated. It was still the
                    largest in Europe. Also, however, Ed was an unabashed Anglophile. He had shared
                    with the British the merciless bombings of the Nazis during the war; had admired
                    their resilience and determination to win out over disaster. I suspect he never
                    fully forgave Germany for that action. However, his antipathy in no way matched
                    Tom's virulent dislikes.</p>
                <p>John Mowinckel, PAO, in Paris, and Ed Schechter, Deputy PAO in Rome were
                    especially in Tom's disfavor. To a lesser extent his personal antipathies
                    extended to Mickey Boerner, previously PAO in Bonn, and Bill Cody, then
                    Assistant Director for Europe. There were others whose names do not come to mind
                    at the moment.</p>
                <p>His dislike for Schechter had a deeper, personal base. Schechter was sitting on a
                    promotion panel in late 1960, just after the election of John Kennedy. One of
                    the officers being considered was Tom Sorensen, then a regular mid-level career
                    officer in the Agency. The panel had already considered Tom, and had not placed
                    him at a competitive level from which he was likely to be promoted. Before the
                    panel concluded its work, Schechter was visited by an Agency officer who
                    suggested that Tom Sorensen ought to be promoted. The point was made that his
                    brother Ted was likely to be in a high position in the Kennedy White House, and
                    it would be politic to promote Tom. The panel did not reconsider its initial
                    decision. Although the deliberations and actions of all promotion panels are
                    supposed to be confidential, Tom somehow knew of the attempt to influence his
                    promotion, and of course since he had not been promoted, knew the attempt had
                    been rejected by the panel.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I don't believe Schechter had ever met Tom in person. Sometime after Tom became a
                    Deputy Director, he made a European trip the itinerary of which included Rome.
                    Schechter met the airplane. Shortly after the preliminary greetings, Tom turned
                    to Schechter and said, with overtones that carried ominous meaning, “I just want
                    you to know that I don't hold any grudge against you because you didn't promote
                    me!”</p>
                <p>When Schechter's tour was up in Rome, Tom saw to it that he was appointed to a
                    rather disagreeable African post. The assignment did not come about, however,
                    for reasons of which I am not aware. In any event, Tom got in his dig. Schechter
                    was an excellent linguist. He knew several languages, including English. His
                    English was, and still is, heavily German accented, though grammatically quite
                    correct. Tom got him ordered to FSI Language School for three months to
                    study—English! A move I considered petty and vindictive. Schechter later was
                    assigned as PAO first in Bolivia and then Caracas, in both of which he was a
                    successful operator. Mowinckel was assigned to Africa—I believe to Zaire. Other
                    European hands were also reassigned to less desirable posts.</p>
                <p>The Special European Program Study of January-March, 1963</p>
                <p>Tom's dislike of the European program resulted in his persuading Ed in the fall
                    of 1962 to make a study of USIA operations in West European countries with a
                    view to seeing where we could cut excess work and divert resources thus saved to
                    non-European countries.</p>
                <p>I was selected to head the study group that went to Europe to make the study. I
                    apparently selected two people whom Tom especially didn't care for, though I was
                    at the time unaware of his dislike. I selected Pat van Delden for whom I had and
                    continue to have, great admiration. She may not still be living, but she
                    possessed unusual abilities, program imagination, and a keen, incisive mind. I
                    also selected Chet Opal who was one of the brightest people we ever had in USIA,
                    but who had a knack for rubbing people the wrong way. He was brilliant and he
                    never failed to make it known that his opinions were perhaps worth more than
                    those of people who objected to his ideas. As I later realized, he obviously had
                    rubbed Tom the wrong way. The fourth member of our party, other than the
                    secretary, was Bob Benedict who at that time was deputy head of the Personnel
                    operation, Mosley having taken over from Bill Weathersby as Director when
                    Weathersby went to India as PAO.</p>
                <p>We traveled to most major posts in western Europe. I thought we made a very
                    careful evaluation. None of us felt—after examining it very carefully—that the
                    program merited the kind of wholesale slashing that Tom Sorensen apparently felt
                    it should undergo. So we tried to select very carefully those aspects of each
                    country program that we did feel were, though not entirely superfluous, could be
                    eliminated without seriously affecting the operations and influence that the
                    program enjoyed in that country.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>We spent about six weeks in Western Europe analyzing and evaluating the western
                    European program.</p>
                <p>This, of course, involved England, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy,
                    Germany, and the low countries. We came back after six weeks of investigation
                    and spent about another month writing the report. Ed thought it was an excellent
                    report and he complemented us greatly on it. He said he thought it was a first
                    rate piece of writing and also a very careful evaluation of what could be done
                    to lower a bit the threshold of European financing and personnel.</p>
                <p>At the time, although Tom was in the meeting when Ed made these remarks, he
                    didn't say anything. But a day or so later he encountered me in the hall and
                    said, you guys didn't really do half a job. He said, you didn't cut the program
                    the way it ought to be cut. It should have been slashed to the bone. And you
                    left it with an awful lot more than it ought to have.</p>
                <p>I made no reply. I just said that I thought we had done the best we could, and I
                    didn't share his view of how deeply the program ought to be cut in Europe.</p>
                <p>Later after Ed was gone and after I had left the position of Assistant Director
                    for Administration, Tom was much more free to exercise his options. I understand
                    that he did cut the European program much more severely than our report had
                    indicated we felt was acceptable. But that came later after I had departed and I
                    didn't see it first hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that timing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Well, the report, the team that went to Europe was appointed at the end
                    of 1962. We started in Europe about mid-January 1963 and spent approximately six
                    weeks there, then returned to Washington and spent another 3 or 4 weeks writing
                    the report so we were involved for the last two weeks of January, all of
                    February and the better part of March.</p>
                <p>Establishment of Office of Soviet and East European Affairs</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were going to comment why you did not go to
                        eastern Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, the reason that we didn't go to eastern Europe was something that
                    had occurred prior to that time. There had been a lot of feeling in the Agency
                    that not enough attention was being given to talking to the Soviet Union and to
                    the eastern bloc nations. Perhaps not enough attention in the sense that we were
                    not selecting the themes that were best calculated to influence the peoples and
                    authorities of East European nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>So Ed asked me and several other officers to give some thought to it. After
                    consulting a number of people, some of whom were opposed to what I was
                    suggesting, and others of which felt it was perhaps a solution, I recommended
                    that we split the European program. At that time the European area office
                    included both eastern and western European countries. I recommended that the
                    Agency set up, at least for a few years, a separate Assistant Directorship for
                    East Europe, breaking it off from the western European program.</p>
                <p>After some substantial disagreement and opposition the recommendation was
                    adopted. Two officers were particularly opposed to it. One was John McKnight who
                    at that time was Assistant Director for Latin America and, of course, Bill Cody,
                    who was then Assistant Director for Europe.</p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: As I was saying when we came to the end of the last tape, the other
                    person objecting most strenuously to he split of the European operation was Bill
                    Cody, understandably—because at that time he was the Assistant Director for
                    European operations. Nevertheless, Ed felt it was a good idea. He gave it his
                    blessing. And we did set up the east European area office.</p>
                <p>Lee Brady was the first head of it. Lee had been the second person, second
                    officer of USIA, and the first to serve in the Soviet Union as, technically, the
                    Cultural Affairs officer. It was, of course, understood both by the Soviets and
                    by USIA that in reality he was PAO for the country. But the Soviets didn't want
                    him designated that way, and wished to restrict USIS activities to the cultural
                    field, with primary emphasis on cultural exchange operations.</p>
                <p>Lee had just completed two years in Moscow at the time we set up this arrangement
                    and was coming in ready for re-assignment. So he was made the first director,
                    i.e., the first Assistant Director, USIA, for Eastern Europe. Just
                    parenthetically, the first USIS officer in Moscow was not Lee but had been Hans
                    Tuch. However, at that point since he was pioneering, the Soviets wouldn't let
                    him remain a USIS officer. He technically had to resign and be appointed by the
                    State Department as a State Department FSO, and for the duration of his tour in
                    the Soviet Union he operated as a State Department rather than a USIA officer.
                    When Lee went out, the Soviets finally conceded that he could remain a USIA
                    officer and he served in that capacity. Tom Tuch became Lee Brady's deputy in
                    the east European affairs office.</p>
                <p>The Soviet and East European Affairs office remained separate from the Western
                    European one for several years. I think it was only somewhere in the late '70s
                    or early '80s that a decision was made to put it back together. Now all Europe
                    again is handled by one office. But for more than ten years Eastern Europe
                    operated separately. I do think at the time it was able to place more emphasis
                    on the programming for the Soviet Bloc than it had been able to place when it
                    was part of the total European operation. Nowadays, probably that time has
                    passed, and it is well that it has been rejoined. But at the time that it
                    happened I think it was a good idea. Ed Murrow seemed to think so too.</p>

                <p>The Cuban Missile Crisis</p>
                <p>I have gotten a bit out of sequence in discussing my time as Assistant Director
                    for Administration, so perhaps it won't be too wrenching to backtrack a little
                    and speak about the Cuban Missile affair. USIA, having squawked loudly over
                    being kept in the dark about the Bay of Pigs invasion, was thoroughly involved
                    in the Cuban Missile crisis. I, however, was not part of the Agency group
                    planning the Agency role. Of course, I was reading the papers, and knew the
                    allegations being made about the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. But that
                    was as far as my knowledge went.</p>
                <p>I was working in my office the Saturday preceding President Kennedy's television
                    bombshell, when I received a call from an old friend and former boss of mine in
                    State—Henry Ford. He was obviously clued into DepState's planning, and began
                    asking me questions about what the Agency was doing in specified areas of
                    preparation. My ignorance was immediately evident, and he signed off quickly. At
                    the first opportunity, I sought out Sorensen to ask him what Henry Ford's query
                    was about. He was furious that I had gotten wind of the coming event. His
                    outburst was so volcanic, that it immediately let me know some frantic planning
                    was underway to meet the missile question. When it was announced a day or so
                    later that there would be a special Presidential telecast on, I believe, Tuesday
                    evening, I knew a confrontation was about to take place.</p>
                <p>A party of some sorts had been planned a week or two before to take place in a
                    conference room at USIA, so a substantial number of Agency employees was there.
                    A TV had been brought in. Everyone was a bit jittery awaiting the moment of the
                    telecast. A few minutes before the president's scheduled appearance, an
                    announcer came on, giving some preliminary remarks about the gravity of the
                    situation, and stating the obvious, that the president was about to make a
                    momentous statement to the American people. Everyone expected the president to
                    be immediately on screen. But no! Not in America! First a commercial. The ad
                    then being shown daily for Doublemint Gum flashed on. Two attractive look-alike
                    young women scantily dressed began cavorting across the screen, singing “Double
                    your Pleasure, Double your fun; Doublemint, Doublemint, Doublemint Gum.” Then,
                    without even a fade-out — fade-in, the President was there, making the
                    announcement of his determined response to Soviet effrontery that, for all we
                    knew, could end in nuclear holocaust! I have never been able to forget the
                    absurdity, the effrontery of commercial broadcasting in showing a frivolous
                    commercial ahead of possible Doomsday revelations.</p>
                <p>Bobby Kennedy's Worldwide Safari and Later Talk to USIA Officers on the Lessons
                    We Should Learn from his Experiences</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I believe it was sometime in 1963 that Bobby Kennedy, then Attorney General of
                    the U.S., made a trip around the world, concentrating primarily on developing
                    countries where considerable leftist agitation was prevalent among students. In
                    each instance, he asked USIS to arrange an appearance for him before the entire
                    student body of each country's principal university. He would speak briefly,
                    then invite the students to fire questions. The thrust of inquiries from a left
                    leaning student body to a capitalist government high official who was also the
                    president's brother can be imagined. Kennedy fielded them pretty well, though as
                    is usually the case, the students were not greatly dissuaded from their
                    semi-Marxist certainties. Press coverage, at least in the U.S., was extensive,
                    and Bobby got the kind of publicity he doubtless was seeking.</p>
                <p>When he returned, Ed and Don Wilson asked him to attend a Director's staff
                    meeting, enlarged for the occasions by a substantial number of officers who did
                    not usually attend. Bobby talked at some length, but the principal theme of his
                    remarks was the USIS abroad was dropping the ball on student contacts. Wherever
                    he went, he said, he found that USIS was not in touch with students. In fact, HE
                    had to go to these countries and appear before the student bodies to give them
                    their first chance at exchanging views with a representative of the American
                    government.</p>
                <p>I knew from personal experience that this was a bum rap for USIS abroad. When
                    Bobby opened the session for questions, I gained recognition, and began my own
                    statement. I said that in the first place it was not true that USIS failed to
                    seek contact with students. If he wanted to take the time, we could inform him
                    of a number of posts that were doing quite well in such an effort. However, I
                    said, when students are determined to go left and castigate the U.S. it isn't
                    very easy to get next to them. I continued that there was a great difference in
                    the ease experienced by a high ranking U.S. official, who happened also to be
                    the president's brother, getting an entire student body to assemble for his
                    remarks, and a regular USIS officer abroad, trying to penetrate the students'
                    politically protective shell.</p>
                <p>My remarks were not appreciated. I could see Kennedy's face redden with visible
                    and not too well controlled anger. I had heard much about the anger of the
                    Kennedys when crossed, and especially of Bobby's vindictive responses. I
                    couldn't help wondering if I had let myself in for retaliation. It never
                    occurred, and I have often wondered if I escaped it only because of Ed
                    Murrow.</p>
                <p>Ed Murrow's Expressed Opinion About Bobby Kennedy</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Ed's opinion of Bobby was formed rather early. I don't remember the exact time of
                    the little story that follows, but it was before the date of Bobby's appearance
                    at USIA. Ed had just attended a National Security Council meeting. I don't
                    recall how it was that he picked me up in his limousine, because I obviously
                    never attended an NSC meeting. In any event, he had dropped by wherever I had
                    been, and was giving me a ride back to the office. He began talking about the
                    just concluded NSC meeting. He began by saying, “Thank God, there isn't much of
                    Bobby in the President.” He went on to explain that in his estimation, Bobby was
                    far more rash, less reasoned and disciplined in his approach to crises—much more
                    inclined toward precipitate action and more vindictive. He sensed that the
                    President was able to keep a damper on Bobby's more rash inclinations. It was
                    the only time I ever heard him express an opinion about the Attorney General,
                    but it was revealing.</p>
                <p>Murrow's Methods of Operation as USIA Director</p>
                <p>I mentioned earlier Ed's efforts to raise Agency prestige. He was particularly
                    zealous in trying to do that. In his appearance at the National Press Club, in
                    radio and occasional TV appearances, in his contacts with press and radio
                    representatives, he stressed the competence and experience of Agency personnel.
                    Because he was so highly respected, his support went far in enhancing the
                    Agency's reputation, which had not always been too high among professional media
                    practitioners.</p>
                <p>But I was impressed as much by his methodology of operation within the Agency.
                    There are those in the years since his death who have stated that he was not a
                    good administrator. I would qualify that. It is true that he had no experience
                    as a technical manager, and there were sometimes flaws in his judgment of
                    personalities. But he had the quality of seeking advice and assistance in areas
                    where he recognized his lack of knowledge. He relied on those who did know, and
                    listened to what they had to say. Not that he didn't reach his own conclusions,
                    but his openness to reason and advice was refreshing.</p>
                <p>His availability to his top staff was a joy.</p>
                <p>He was also always available. I could call him up, and if he wasn't in conference
                    with somebody else, I could ask to see him, and he would invite me to his office
                    within five minutes time. It was an open door policy. The same was true of any
                    other officer in the Agency who felt that he had something of immediate
                    importance he wanted to get off his chest with Ed or any policy about which he
                    wished to consult him.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I think back upon that time because although I left the Agency some years ago, I
                    still know a little about what goes on and how things are handled there today.
                    The difference is amazing. If often takes several days to get an appointment
                    with the Director now, I'm told. And very frequently it is necessary to send an
                    advance memorandum indicating the subject matter to be discussed. With Ed there
                    was never any such problem. If you told him in two or three words what you
                    wanted to discuss, you could come down and talk to him about it, often get half
                    an hour of his time, a thorough consideration and usually a decision if one was
                    necessary as to what should be done.</p>
                <p>1962: The Trip to Paris and Tehran</p>
                <p>During Ed's incumbency he made a couple of trips abroad other than the 1961 tour
                    around Latin America. One of them was in the summer and fall of 1962. He went
                    first to Paris. He became ill in Paris, diagnosed as a low-grade pneumonia, and
                    he was held up there for a few days. But he was so insistent about going on that
                    he got up before he was really ready to do so, and went on to Tehran. He had a
                    relapse there and was very ill. At that time I wasn't aware of the fact, because
                    I had not known him personally before, that for years he'd had a persistent
                    weakness in the lungs, and had had many of these bouts of similar nature, some
                    of which were exceedingly serious.</p>
                <p>Finally after he was able to travel he had to cut out the rest of his itinerary,
                    and come on back to the States where he spent some time recuperating before he
                    could come back to work.</p>
                <p>Everyone recognizing his heavy smoking was of course immediately wary and afraid
                    that perhaps he was developing lung cancer. The X-rays taken at the time I've
                    been told subsequently showed enough suspicious shadings to have developed more
                    attention than his illness received. But the doctors who looked at it felt
                    perhaps it was just old scar tissue from former bouts with pneumonia and they
                    let it go. A little more than a year later Ed did come down with the final
                    illness which was diagnosed as lung cancer. There is no use repeating the
                    account of what happened thereafter.</p>
                <p>Murrow's Angry Speech to the Conference of theNational Association of Newspaper
                    Editors</p>
                <p>I think there's one final story about Ed that probably is worth recounting now.
                    And that is that he had become so frustrated by his constant attempts to gain
                    more resources for USIA, particularly larger appropriations, that he finally
                    decided to make one all out push in the spring and summer when we were up for
                    our hearings in 1962—no, 1963—with Rooney and see if he couldn't improve our
                    fiscal position.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>So we all spent a tremendous amount of time, an unusual amount of time in
                    preparing for the hearings that year. I thought we presented a very excellent
                    case. Rooney himself seemed to be impressed. When we left the hearings he made
                    some remarks the exact nature of which I cannot now recall. But it led all of us
                    to believe that he was favorably disposed towards giving us a better
                    appropriation break than he had in previous years.</p>
                <p>Well, when the committee report came out which it did along in July or August—I
                    don't recall the precise date, late, of course, because in those days the
                    appropriations were supposed to be enacted by July 1—Not only had he not given
                    us any increase to speak of, but he had actually placed a couple of
                    restrictions, limitations in the appropriation which limited our ability to give
                    adequate representation allowances and to carry out certain program activities
                    that we had planned as new initiatives. Ed was absolutely livid. He felt that he
                    had been betrayed by Rooney and been led down the garden path. He made up his
                    mind that he was going to blast out in public at this lack of appreciation of
                    what the Agency was doing—was capable of doing abroad.</p>
                <p>It happened that he was due to make a speech either before the National
                    Association of Broadcasters or the National Association of Newspaper Editors in
                    Atlanta. I can't recall at the moment which one it was, though I think it was
                    the Newspaper Editors. So he elected to make his pitch at that time.</p>
                <p>I think it was the one time he lost his cool. And I'm afraid the rest of us lost
                    our cool with him. Knowing Rooney we should have admonished him not to do it, we
                    did not, Don Wilson, Tom Sorensen and I were called down to his office to help
                    him put the finishing touches on his speech, and he took off for Atlanta where
                    he delivered a scathing denunciation of the Congressional committees which were
                    incapable of recognizing the value of USIA, stating that something ought to be
                    done by the public to force a better consideration of our needs.</p>
                <p>Of course, Rooney took this as a personal attack on him, which in effect it was.
                    All the rapport that had been developed between Murrow and Rooney over the
                    preceding 2-1/2 years was shattered in that one speech. Ed, when he came back
                    from the speech, wasn't feeling too well even at that time. But he tried to get
                    an appointment to see Rooney. Rooney refused to see him. He tried several times
                    and never could get an appointment.</p>
                <p>Last Confrontation with Rooney1963: Ed's Final Illness and Resignation from
                    USIA</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>In the meantime he went up to Baltimore one afternoon in October to give another
                    speech. After the speech was over he was asked to appear on a short radio
                    program being broadcast from a Baltimore station. Right in the middle of that
                    broadcast he lost his voice completely. It just went out on him. There wasn't
                    any voice left. Well, of course, they had to shut off the interview from the
                    air. I don't know. I wasn't listening to it. So I don't know just what
                    arrangements them made to cover up, but it was a frightening thing. Ed was
                    brought out of the studio, came on back to Washington and finally admitted that
                    this wasn't the first time such a thing had happened. It had occurred on other
                    occasions but not under such dramatic circumstances to that it had not become a
                    matter of public knowledge.</p>
                <p>Of course, he was immediately rushed off to the hospital the next day. And that's
                    when doctors discovered that the bronchi and one of the lungs were seriously
                    affected and that it probably indeed was cancer. He was advised to have to
                    undergo almost immediate surgery. Above all he was going to have to stop his
                    smoking immediately. That was probably the greatest perdition that Ed ever went
                    through, to have to stop smoking which he'd been doing so heavily or so many
                    years. But, of course, he did.</p>
                <p>At the time that he went in, the doctor told him that they thought they probably
                    would only have to remove the upper lobe of the affected lung and that it
                    apparently wasn't going to be as serious an operation as it turned out to be. In
                    the event, they had to remove one whole lung. The operation was much more
                    extensive, much more devastating than Ed had anticipated. He tried to come back
                    although he was out for several weeks. I saw him occasionally because he wanted
                    to keep in touch with the Senate side of the budget hearings which were coming
                    up. I went out on two or three occasions to his home to brief him on it and also
                    to get his ideas on the assignment of resources to emphasize certain aspects of
                    the program.</p>
                <p>Well, it was obvious that he even then was in pain and wasn't recovering as he
                    had expected to. I never saw him dressed on any of those occasions. He was
                    always in pajamas, slippers and bathrobe. It looked to me like he was a long way
                    from returning which he said he hoped to do. He did subsequently come back to
                    the Agency for a few days at a time, and he made another effort to see Rooney.
                    The first couple of times Rooney still refused to see him. But finally at last,
                    somewhere around, I don't know just when it was, probably late November or early
                    December. He agreed to see Ed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Congressman John Rooney?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: John Rooney, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was from New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>SCHMIDT: He was from Brooklyn, New York. And he was the chairman of our
                    Subcommittee on Appropriations in the House. I should have said beforehand that
                    Ed having lost one lung was just a shadow of his former self. He could not say
                    more than one sentence—sometimes even less—without running out of breath at or
                    before the end of it. Often he couldn't even finish one sentence. He would start
                    a sentence, tail off because he didn't have enough lung power to finish it, take
                    another breath, finish the sentence and then just be exhausted.</p>
                <p>Well, he went up to see Rooney in Rooney's office on the Hill. I wasn't with him
                    at the time. I think it was our general counsel Stan Pleasant, who went up with
                    him. Rooney was visibly shaken, because he himself had just undergone lung
                    surgery, not nearly as radical as Ed's. But surgeons had taken out an upper lobe
                    of one of his lungs. When he saw Ed in this condition I think he perhaps looked
                    down the vista of the future and thought: there I am a little later on.</p>
                <p>Anyway, he softened notably toward Ed as a result of that and wished him well
                    when he left. And as far as I know the two men never met again. And it didn't
                    affect Rooney's attitude toward the USIA appropriations. We never got any more
                    money out of him either that year or to my knowledge in the next two or three
                    years thereafter.</p>
                <p>Ed still tried to come back to the Agency. By the end of November or early
                    December (1963) he knew he wasn't going to hack it. That's when he submitted his
                    resignation. I have mentioned earlier the cruel experience he had with Lyndon
                    Johnson in trying to resign.</p>
                <p>As a final comment I remember the sadly ironic fact that when Winston Churchill
                    broke his hip several months to a year before Ed's illness forced him out of the
                    Agency, the British Government, knowing that people of Churchill's age rarely
                    outlived a broken hip, cabled Ed asking him if he would write an obituary for
                    the great man to hold for publication at the time of actual death. Miraculously,
                    Churchill recovered and slightly outlived Ed. With that, I think I will leave
                    the discussion of my time as Assistant Director, Administration.</p>
                <p>September, 1964: Consul General, Izmir, Turkey</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next assignment was Turkey, I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, but there was an unexpected interlude. Ed, before he became ill,
                    had asked me what overseas post I preferred. I told him Germany, and he agreed.
                    In March of 1964, I entered the FSI to study the German language. It was a four
                    month course, and I managed to do rather well in it, though I am not a facile
                    linguist. Just a few days before I completed the course, Ambassador McGhee in
                    Germany told DepState that he wanted to appoint Al Hemsing, who was the DPAO in
                    Germany with offices in Berlin, to the PAO. My four months of intensive German
                    went out the window, and I was without an assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>After a month or so of negotiation with State, I was named Consul General in
                    Izmir, Turkey. At the time, I was deeply disappointed, at losing Germany, but
                    the assignment in Izmir turned out to be one of the highlights of my career.</p>
                <p>My first inclination in this account was to exclude any detailed discussion of
                    the Turkey assignment, because it was not a USIA position. However, in thinking
                    about it, I realized that much of what I did in Izmir was similar to USIS
                    activities, so I decided to spend some time recounting the highlights.</p>
                <p>The Mayor of Izmir</p>
                <p>Within the first few days I had met and made a close friend of the flamboyant
                    Mayor of Izmir, Osman Kibar. He was a short stocky character of boisterous
                    nature. He reminded me of a cross between Jimmy Walker, the backslapping, public
                    relations genius who was mayor of New York in the 1920's, and Jimmy Durante,
                    who, with benefit of a large nose, he somewhat resembled. We immediately formed
                    a rapport. Kibar was not only mayor, he was also one of the founders of the
                    justice Party. That party was the successor to the Democrat party that had been
                    turned out of office in 1960 by a military coup that ended with the execution of
                    Prime Minister Menderes. When the Army loosened its controls a bit, the party
                    was permitted to return to politics. It reorganized and assumed the new name of
                    Justice Party, and when elections were again allowed in 1965, overturned the
                    military's supported candidate and won control of the Turkish Government again.
                    Kibar's support during my time in Izmir was invaluable to me in getting entree
                    into many important circles.</p>
                <p>Press Contacts In Izmir</p>
                <p>My next move was to make contact with the local press. There were three papers in
                    Izmir, the largest, most influential, Yeni Asir, was middle of the road
                    politically, and generally supported the new Justice Party. The other two were
                    radically left leaning. They were knee-jerk, radical, anti-American rags with
                    relatively small circulation. I have forgotten their names, but they have long
                    since failed and ceased publication. My good relations with the principal
                    reporters at Yeni Asir, especially their top man, Halik Cansin, on occasion
                    during my Izmir days enabled me to counter anti-American stories and get better
                    explanations in print about matters currently riling the Turkish public.</p>
                <p>Contacts With Turkish Student Organization</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>One of my principal targets in Izmir was the Ege (Aegean) University branch of
                    the national student organization. The latter was pretty well radicalized, and
                    delighted in finding some excuse to riot against almost anything American. The
                    Ege national university at Izmir was not quite as irrational as the Istanbul
                    branch, or the national headquarters at Ankara, but they were a reasonable
                    facsimile thereof. Ships from the U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet frequently visited
                    Izmir, and the students took to holding anti-U.S. rallies on the occasion of one
                    or another of these visits. The most absurd instance occurred on one such fleet
                    stopover when the students, finding nothing else to riot about, claimed to be
                    insulted because the Turkish flags flown by the ships allegedly had misplaced
                    slightly the relative position of the crescent and the star that adorns the
                    national (red colored) flag. The misplacement, if indeed it existed at all, was
                    so slight that I could not detect it. The flags had been ordered from a
                    flag-maker specifically for the fleet's visit. Probably the maker was not a Turk
                    firm. The students pretended to be outraged at the insult to Turkish nationalism
                    by the callous desecration of the sacred flag.</p>
                <p>I decided to tackle the student antagonists. I had already made friends with the
                    Aegean Regional chairmen of both political parties. The revived Justice Party
                    was one. The other was the Republican Peoples Party (known as the RPP).
                    Interestingly enough, the RPP was the party closest to and supporting the
                    military which at that time governed the country, but it was the relatively
                    radical party as opposed to the conservative Justice Party. I knew that the
                    student organization had close ties to the RPP, so I called on my friend who was
                    the RPP regional chairman, and told him I wanted to start meeting with the
                    executive committee of the Ege University student organization once every month
                    or two. I proposed that I meet with them initially at a neutral site. The
                    purpose of the session would be to discuss with them frankly and off the record
                    any point of disagreement they had with American policies. I promised to give
                    them straight answers, and if I could not answer a given question, I would seek
                    the answer later, and give it to them the next time we met. I gave the RPP
                    chairman a couple days to talk to the students, and then I issued them both a
                    written and verbal invitation.</p>
                <p>Obviously my political friend had done his work, because the student executive
                    committee agreed. Initially, we met in a hotel party room downtown. After a few
                    meetings they realized that I was not going to try to overwhelm them, but would
                    talk reasonably and seriously. So I was finally able to persuade them to hold
                    the meetings as the ConGen residence. I would invite them for dinner, and an
                    after-dinner discussion.</p>
                <p>It became something of a game. After a short time, I could guess with moderate
                    accuracy what they would bring up at the next meeting. I enlisted the help of
                    the Embassy Economic and Political sections to get materials on what I expected
                    to have to answer, and would carefully read up on the anticipated subject
                    matter. It worked quite well. In the latter months of my tour, the meetings
                    occasionally lasted into the small hours of the morning, once or twice breaking
                    up after 3:00 a.m. It seems doubtful that if the students weren't interested
                    they would have stayed the course.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I don't claim to have turned the students away completely from their
                    anti-American biases. They were always a little wary of me, but I convinced them
                    by a couple of very frank exchanges that they could rely on me to be honest. I
                    believe the sessions were important and within reasonable limits, successful. At
                    one of our meetings, the then president of the regional student group was a
                    little hot under the collar and was making some outrageously absurd allegations.
                    I said to him that I would be very interested to see where he was in his
                    political viewpoint and regarding his thinking about American policies twenty
                    years from that time. I told him I was betting he would have turned around
                    completely in his political outlook, would be rather conservative, and rational
                    about his views of the U.S. I revisit Turkey occasionally. The last time I was
                    there was nineteen years after the time of my bet with the young man. I didn't
                    see him personally, but my friends from my ConGen days told me that he was now a
                    conservative business man, had given up his student day radicalism, and was at
                    least rational about things American.</p>
                <p>Contacts With the Turkish Provincial Governors</p>
                <p>Another of my targets was the group of men who were then the governors of the 13
                    or so provinces in my consular district. I arrived at a critical time in
                    Turkish-American relations. Turks were still angry at the U.S. because after
                    persuading the Turkish Government to place missiles in Turkey, and training a
                    substantial number of the Turkish military on how to operate the, the U.S.
                    removed them all shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis. Turks were convinced
                    the U.S. had let them down, and used the missile removal as a quid pro quo with
                    the Soviets to get the USSR missiles removed from Cuba. I have been told that
                    the removal was not primarily motivated by the Cuban affair, and on the other
                    hand have been told that it indeed was. I am not sure even today. But in any
                    event, another crisis had arisen. In the summer of 1964, it looked as though the
                    Turkish Army was poised to invade Cyprus. President Johnson sent a vitriolic
                    letter to Ismet Inonu, then Prime Minister of Turkey, stating that if the
                    Turkish army did invade Cyprus, and if the Soviet then attacked Turkey in
                    retaliation, the U.S. would not come to Turkey's aid. Of course, this was a
                    complete repudiation of the guarantees inherent in the NATO agreement, and the
                    Turks were rightly outraged. Johnson was absolutely wrong.</p>
                <p>I spent much of my time the first few months I was in Turkey visiting all the
                    governors, a few more than once. The Johnson letter was invariably a major point
                    of discussion. I met it head on, agreeing that the letter was contrary to NATO
                    guarantees, and trying to reassure the governors that the U.S. would not have
                    deserted them in the face of a Soviet invasion. It was a gamble, because Johnson
                    could actually have done otherwise. I felt, however, that if it came to
                    invasion, the president could not have deserted our NATO ally. Since I made
                    personal friends of nearly all the governors, I believe I contributed greatly to
                    calming down their fears and indignation.</p>
                <p>The Turkish and American Military</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Finally, both the Turkish and the American Military had been rather stand-offish
                    with my predecessor. I was told that neither were on very good terms with him. I
                    undertook to reverse this situation, and did so. I developed close friendships
                    with the commanding generals of both Land Southeast (the Southeastern command of
                    NATO based in Izmir) and Sixth ATAF (the Air Command of NATO there). I also,
                    with the help of my Turkish political advisor and interpreter, made friends with
                    the Turkish Air, Navy, and Army commanders in the Aegean region. Every time I
                    gave a reception, I invited all the top military commanders, American and
                    Turkish. The Mayor used to stand close to me as the guests arrived to see
                    whether or not the Turkish military would come. They invariably did, and the
                    Mayor would always comment on the fact, saying that it was a minor triumph to
                    have gotten them all present.</p>
                <p>Attendance at the Turkish Labor Party Meeting</p>
                <p>The Turkish Labor Party was relatively mall, but loudly activist, and loudly
                    anti-American. In the spring of 1966, they scheduled a large meeting in Izmir,
                    at which the Chairman of the Party, Mehmet Ali Aybar, was to speak. He was a
                    tall, greying, distinguished appearing man with shining expressive eyes, and was
                    a spell binding orator. By this time, my successive meetings with the students
                    and the governors were well and widely known. To my surprise, I received a
                    personal invitation from Aybar to attend the Labor conclave in Izmir. I debated
                    as to whether I should or should not go. I realized this was a challenge to me,
                    and if I didn't attend, I would probably be ridiculed in the leftist press as a
                    cowardly evader of contact with this leftist attacker of American policies. On
                    the other hand, I felt sure that if I did go, I would be ridiculed in some other
                    way. Without consulting the Embassy at Ankara, which I felt might well forbid my
                    attendance, I decided to go. And did. I had my interpreter with me so I could be
                    constantly aware of any slurs or attacks being delivered by Aybar at me
                    personally or at the U.S. Aybar spoke eloquently for more than three hours. He
                    made only a few snide remarks about “our American friend” but took off more
                    sternly against some American policies. In balance, though, his speech was not
                    overly offensive.</p>
                <p>The next morning, the Izmir leftist press was at it as I expected. There was
                    quite an article on my attendance accompanied by a number of snide remarks as to
                    what prompted the nosey American Consul General to be there. In addition, there
                    was a political cartoon, a caricature of me that was quite recognizable, dressed
                    in a Texas ten gallon hat, cowboy chaps and shining spurs, a pistol at belt, and
                    $ signs all over my cowboy shirt and trousers. The Embassy was displeased, and
                    told me I should not have appeared. However, the reaction on all sides in Izmir
                    was commendatory, so I guess it played well with the public.</p>
                <p>Departure from Izmir</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I was gratified at the time of my exit from Izmir. I made it a point, starting a
                    couple weeks before departure, to call on all the top contacts I had made,
                    including the editors of the two left-wing newspapers, to say goodbye. With
                    these last two, I said that I realized our political outlooks were at opposite
                    poles, but that I felt we had exercised an honest dialogue over our differences,
                    and I thanked them for their coverage of my activities (even though on several
                    occasions it was hardly pleasing). Accolades on my two year performance were
                    effusive. Even the leftist papers gave grudging praise for my activities. It was
                    the most direct and satisfying public expression of recognized accomplishment I
                    ever enjoyed. It was a highlight of my career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your next post was Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: Yes, but there was a considerable interim before I went out there. I was
                    selected to sit on a joint State-USIA promotion panel that fall, considering
                    class 2 officers for promotion to class 1 (These were the old class grades,
                    before the whole grade structure was re-shaped about ten years or so ago.) This
                    lasted from mid-September to just before Christmas. I then took home leave, and
                    returned to Washington in February. Meanwhile there was extensive discussion in
                    Washington as to where I was to be assigned. It was thought that Barry Zorthian
                    was soon coming out of Vietnam, and that I might replace him. The other
                    possibility was PAO Thailand, where a smaller communist insurgency was in full
                    swing. I had expected to go out in March. Instead decisions hung in the balance
                    for nearly three months. I went on a two week inspection trip to Taiwan, and
                    returned. Barry still hanging in there. Finally, it was decided that I would go
                    to Thailand. (Barry remained in Vietnam close to two more years.)</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me. What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SCHMIDT: This was the end of May, 1967. In my final briefings for Thailand I was
                    told that USIA was expanding the Thai program very rapidly. We felt it necessary
                    to expand because there was a substantial insurgency in northern Thailand, and a
                    smaller one, completely separate from the other, in southern Thailand. We had
                    just opened the last of 13 field posts scattered throughout Thailand in various
                    smaller cities both up country and down on the Malaya peninsula near the border
                    between Thailand and Malaysia. In the north, we had opened the most recent post,
                    the 13th, Nong Khai, just across the Mekong River from Vientiane, the capital of
                    Laos.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>An additional post or two had been tentatively authorized, and I was given every
                    reason to believe that we were going to expand further. However, just as I was
                    leaving, Dan Oleksiw, who was then the Assistant Director of USIA for East Asia
                    and the Pacific, told me that when I got out there, I should perhaps think about
                    cutting back one or two positions, because Director Leonard Marks was getting a
                    bit concerned about the size of the Thai program. He thought perhaps we were
                    overstaffed there. I was never given to understand that Leonard was at all
                    concerned about the number of field posts we had. Nor was I told that he had any
                    reservations about the kind of field program the post was operating.</p>
                <p>Nature of the Field Program</p>
                <p>Each field post had a small library, but its principal effort was in the
                    villages. Every field post was equipped with several mobile units. Teams from
                    the post, sometimes with the Branch PAO along, other times with only Thai
                    employees, would make large numbers of village visits each month. The BPAO was
                    expected to spend 40 to 50% of his time out in the villages. The communist
                    propaganda effort was touting a principal theme that Thai Government officials
                    didn't care anything about the people living in the back country. They were only
                    interested in feathering their own nests, increasing their salaries, etc. So,
                    each team attempted to get one Thai official, local, provincial or national to
                    go with the team to the target village. There, he would be expected to provide
                    some service (medical, agricultural, etc.) to the village, and give a talk on
                    what plans the government was making to aid the village. Later in the evening,
                    the team would erect mopix screens and show movies. Some of these were merely
                    documentaries; others showed the activities of the King and Queen (very popular
                    figures in Thailand), and later, USIS had its own motion picture studios in our
                    offices in Bangkok, and produced a number of blatantly anti-communist films,
                    using a story line to show how insurgent teams tried to take over villages and
                    impress the young men into the insurgent para-military forces. There were others
                    that demonstrated the tactics used by insurgents to infiltrate a village, and
                    ultimately take it over.</p>
                <p>It was pretty hard hitting anti-communist stuff, featuring Thai actors and
                    locales in the North or South, easily recognizable to the villagers. The
                    insurgents were right up in the areas being visited. From deserting insurgent
                    soldiers who defected to the Government, we later learned that in most cases the
                    insurgent bands had orders not to shoot Americans on these village visit teams,
                    but at the time, knowing the insurgents were all around, we exercised great
                    caution. Just after I left Thailand in 1970, one of our local teams out of
                    Chiang Mai was ambushed, and all three Thai employees from the branch post were
                    killed. We made every effort to teach young officers coming into USIA and being
                    assigned to Thailand to learn Thai. Most of them learned it well, and during
                    village visits, made it a point to converse extensively with the villagers, find
                    out about their wishes and expectations, and generally give a good impression of
                    Americans. I believe we scored many points with the back country people, and
                    now, that Thailand is developing rapidly, and the isolation of the villages is
                    disappearing, the fruits of that program are beginning to be demonstrated.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>The Bangkok Part of USIS was the More ConventionalUSIS Type Program</p>
                <p>Back in Bangkok, we ran the more conventional USIS type of program. Press and
                    publications, a huge binational cultural center with a large well used library
                    collection, and an enormous English teaching effort. In fact, many Thais who
                    later rose to responsible positions in Government and business learned English
                    through the Center. The Center was established as the AUA—The American
                    University Alumni Association, for those Thais who had gone to University in the
                    States. It has high prestige in the country, and continues to add to its
                    prestigious and expanding membership. Most of our exhibits were staged through
                    the center. There was a heavy exchange program, including a very active
                    Fulbright operation.</p>
                <p>In addition, Bangkok was the supply line for the field. The motion pictures were
                    either made or distributed out of our large mopix studio offices. Our print shop
                    produced a continuing series of posters and booklets to be put up or otherwise
                    distributed by the mobile unit teams. Enormous quantities of these products were
                    reproduced in the Regional Service Center at Manila. I had some doubts about the
                    effectiveness of poster and pamphlet/booklet effort. Thai literacy was not very
                    great, and the posters usually needed a little reading ability to make the
                    pictorial themes fully understandable. I don't think they were worth the
                    expenditures we put into them. The actual presence in the villages of our mobile
                    teams, the motion pictures, the visits of the Thai officials, I feel were highly
                    useful.</p>
                <p>Radio in Thailand</p>
                <p>In addition to the mobile unit field program which USIS was running directly, we
                    had obtained the use of a mobile transmitter from the Army. This transmitter we
                    set up in north central Thailand, with a USIS officer in charge, and some mobile
                    units. The purpose was to train Thai Army personnel to carry out a roving
                    reporter type of program in the field. Each Army team was sent out regularly
                    with mobile tape recorders to interview rural Thai people. They would record
                    accounts of the villagers' problems. When the Thai government did something to
                    help a village, they recorded those events. If communist insurgents raided a
                    village, or made efforts to recruit young men into service, these traveling
                    reporters recorded the villagers' accounts of the event. The tapes were edited,
                    and played on the field transmitter beamed back to the villages. It was an
                    effective program. Villagers often heard tapes recorded in their own or nearby
                    villages, and often by voices they recognized as friends or acquaintances. The
                    authenticity made the program. Sometimes, however, it was difficult to persuade
                    the laid back Thais to spend enough time on the road. The effort was designed to
                    train enough personnel so the American could be withdrawn, leaving the Army to
                    carry on with its own resources. I regret to say that after we withdrew the
                    American supervisor/trainer, the Program wound down, and lost much of its
                    vigor.</p>
                <p>The radio section in Bangkok, however, was productive. We had a fine radio
                    officer in Ivan Campbell, put out innumerable shows, and were able to place most
                    of them on regular Thai stations.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The Battle of the Cutbacks</p>
                <p>At urgings from Dan Oleksiw, I did reduce two or three positions in Bangkok, but
                    still there was no indication that we should cut back field posts. Later, I
                    began to get hints that Washington wanted further cutbacks, but it was not until
                    toward the end of my second year that the pressures began to be direct. I guess
                    because of the lack of actual orders, I was late in realizing what was wanted,
                    and was late in coming to the realization that a complete turnabout in the
                    program was in the making.</p>
                <p>The U.S. election was approaching in the fall of 1968. USIS set up its usual
                    “election center” with VOA broadcasts coming in and a huge electoral tote board.
                    The Thais were all cheering for a Nixon victory, because they felt that U.S.
                    support against their own insurgency and secondarily, that in Vietnam, would be
                    better assured under a Republican than under a Democratic administration.
                    Earlier returns indicated that Humphrey might pull out a victory. But as the day
                    wore on, and Nixon's victory seemed assured, cheers arose.</p>
                <p>As things turned out, Nixon began to wind down the war, and the American support
                    for counter insurgency began to dwindle. Frank Shakespeare came in as USIA
                    Director, and began to exert recognizable pressure to phase out our Thai
                    counter-insurgency effort. The Thai Army had a small, lackluster type of village
                    field program, in which they tried to do something of what USIS did in its
                    village effort. However, the army had little stomach for operating in the boon
                    docks. Their fleet of vehicles was small; and they simply had neither the
                    resources, the know-how, the willingness to work with the civilian Thai
                    government people, nor the will to carry on vigorously. They seemed, however, to
                    be the best, if not the only bet to take over the field operation.</p>
                <p>There was a rather ineffective Thai Department of Public Affairs, but its
                    contributions to any sort of counter insurgency were virtually nil.</p>
                <p>So, when it became evident that we would have eventually to either greatly reduce
                    or perhaps fully abandon our field program, we began a serious effort to prepare
                    the Thai army field unit to assume our functions. The going was slow. The Thai
                    army had no desire at all to assume USIS field functions. Periodically I would
                    have calls from the army colonel in charge of the unit pleading with me not to
                    stop our program. Even the prospect of getting all our C-J 6 mobile units didn't
                    titillate them. Nevertheless, they were finally convinced it was going to
                    happen, and so resigned themselves to taking over. Gordon Murchie, who had been
                    closest of all USIS officers to the army group practically lived with them. John
                    Reid devoted 90% of his time in the attempt to push the Thais into learning how
                    to operate in USIS fashion.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>About that time, Frank Shakespeare made the only trip he made during my
                    incumbency to Asia. He was accompanied by the ubiquitous and sour Teddy
                    Weinthal, who was bitterly opposed to any American involvement in
                    counterinsurgency either in Vietnam or in Thailand. Most of the visit was a
                    probe and a push to speed up the turnover to the Thais. I was suffering from a
                    terrible cold, really a flu, and it soon became apparent that Frank and I were
                    not very compatible. The turning point came, I guess, the night the Ambassador
                    gave a dinner for Frank in the Residential compound. Finally Frank turned to me
                    and said: Lew, how long do you think it will take the Thai Army counter
                    insurgency unit to take over the field program. I made a serious mistake. I knew
                    the Thais would never really perform. And even if they did make a semblance of
                    doing so, it was going to be a long pull. I was annoyed at Frank, and I felt
                    lousy. So, facetiously, I said, Oh, about seven or eight years. Frank, I
                    realized immediately, was not amused by facetious humor. It was probably then
                    that he decided I ought to be removed from the Thai program. He didn't know it,
                    but that didn't bother me. I had made it plain that I would go to Thailand for
                    only one three-year tour, which would be up in May of 1970. In any event, he
                    clearly decided at that point that I was a total loss to USIA. This was proven
                    on a few subsequent occasions when attempts of other officers in the Agency who
                    had known my abilities over a long past tried to promote me for good
                    assignments. Frank turned them all down, never having the courage to tell me
                    directly that he was blocking them. It was that antipathy of Frank for me—and
                    vice versa—that crystallized my own decision to retire early, which I did in
                    1972. But I'm getting ahead of my account.</p>
                <p>The program was wound down. The operation replete with all the mobile units, was
                    turned over with pomp and ceremony to the Thai army by my successor a few months
                    after I left Thailand. As we had anticipated, the Thais were happy to get the
                    equipment, but not the program, and it gradually lapsed into innocuous
                    desuetude. The USIS was out of the village operation by late 1970, and all but
                    about three or four of the field posts were closed.</p>
                <p>But I'm getting ahead of my account again.</p>
                <p>Dan Oleksiw and the Field Program</p>
                <p>By late '69, Dan had become a strong advocate of cutting out the field program.
                    Some time after Frank's visit, Dan made one of his frequent visits to the post.
                    His arrival coincided with a planned visit of mine to our southernmost post at
                    Songkhla, not too far from the Malaysian border. From there we were due to make
                    a village visit. And when that was over, I scheduled a few days leave to go over
                    into Malaysia and pay a visit to Malaysia's Penang Island, a pleasant old
                    British colonial type duty free port.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>I told him about my plans, and he decided to go south with me, then on to Penang.
                    I persuaded him to make the village visit with me as well. It happened that our
                    visit coincided with an event of considerable moment for the village. AID ran a
                    training program for midwives near Bangkok. A young woman from the village that
                    was our target for the evening had just completed her training, and was
                    returning to set up shop in her hometown. AID had also built her a small clinic
                    in the village which was being dedicated that evening. In accordance with our
                    plan always to have a Thai official present if possible during a USIS
                    visitation, we had been able with the assistance of AID, to get the Deputy
                    Minister of Health of the Royal Thai Government to be our visiting official. The
                    mood was festive. The clinic was dedicated. The young midwife was introduced to
                    cheers and the Deputy Minister gave a speech, none of which I understood, but
                    evidently the villagers were grateful for the gifts and the visit.</p>
                <p>The next day, I took off with Dan for Penang. We were there two or three days,
                    during which time Dan made no comments about the village visit, or anything else
                    about the Thai program. We had long conversations about many other things, but
                    nothing official. We parted at the end of the visit. He went on to Kuala Lumpur,
                    Malaysia, and I back to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>About three months later I received an “eyes only” cable from Dan. Its opening
                    sentence said: “I direct USIS Thailand to cease immediately all midwifery
                    programming,” and went on to direct other reductions in the USIS operation. I
                    was thunderstruck. I couldn't believe Dan really thought we were involved in a
                    midwife program. I felt it was a grandstand play to catch attention back in
                    Washington, and make it appear that we had been caught in actions completely
                    unrelated to what we were supposed to be doing. I was so angry that I waited two
                    days to send a reply. I should have waited longer. I was still too upset.
                    Instead of calmly replying that his whole statement was foolish and
                    misleading—that this one village visit happened to coincide with the culmination
                    of an AID project (that we would in any event have publicized in support of
                    AID), and had nothing to do with our ongoing work in the country, I blew a cork.
                    I started out by saying we could not stop what we weren't doing, and raged on
                    from there. Clearly, it was a mistake on my part, and probably hurt me more in
                    Washington than even my previous facetious remarks to Frank Shakespeare had
                    done. I will say that the cable got high level attention in Washington.
                    Seemingly, almost everyone heard about it.</p>
                <p>I am revising this part of my interview while editing it, long after the
                    interview was first transcribed. I probably would not have mentioned the Midwife
                    episode had I not read the transcript of Dan's own interview recently. In it he
                    remarks that one of his tasks in his position as Assistant Director East Asia
                    and Pacific, was keeping the Thai program on track, and eliminating their
                    activities in such areas as midwifery. I still can't believe that he ever truly
                    thought we were into such activity in Thailand, but this statement nearly 20
                    years after the event makes me wonder.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I will close the discussion of my USIS tour in Thailand with accounts of two
                    occurrences not directly related to the program.</p>
                <p>The Non-Peace Corps Related Actions of the Peace Corps</p>
                <p>As usual in most countries, the Peace Corps representatives in Thailand were a
                    fine bunch of young people, and for their own program, they were doing a
                    splendid service.</p>
                <p>Their Director was Tim Adams, son of the noted columnist and commentator of the
                    30's and 40's, Franklin P. Adams. Tim was a loudly vocal opponent of American
                    involvement in Vietnam. His opinion was his own and he was entitled to it. But
                    his vocal opposition in Thailand, where the Embassy was deeply involved with the
                    Thai Government in supporting their own counterinsurgency effort, and the U.S.
                    Air Force was flying bombing missions into Vietnam was embarrassing. Whenever
                    challenged, Tim would loudly assert that he owed no allegiance to the Embassy,
                    and was free to express publicly any opinion he held. He also preached the same
                    philosophy to the Peace Corps members, one or another of whom would occasionally
                    sound off adversely, not only on the American role in Vietnam, but also on the
                    U.S. support of Thai counterinsurgency efforts.</p>
                <p>The most irritating incident came when a Peace Corps girl gave an interview to
                    one of the Bangkok English language newspapers, in which she remarked that she
                    had been recently in Ubon (where many of the bombing missions originated). She
                    said that she watched a U.S. bomber take off into a gorgeous red sunset, noted
                    the colorful tail of flame from the jet's engines mix with the grandeur of the
                    setting sun, and wished that the pilot would be shot down in similarly red
                    flames over Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Knifing Incident on the Chao Phya River</p>
                <p>I had been in Bangkok only a few weeks by the Fourth of July. Several of us had
                    been attending the Embassy Fourth of July observance, and had gathered at the
                    home of one of our USIS staffers. Someone came running in to announce that there
                    had been a serious incident on a boat that a group of AID people had hired for
                    the evening to make an excursion on the river. Reportedly a USIA man was
                    involved. A group of us rushed to the dock where the boat had come in from the
                    water.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>It seems that a man who was a VOA monitor whose job it was to monitor foreign
                    broadcasts, particularly those from hostile nations such as the USSR, China,
                    North Vietnam, etc. and also monitor the strength of Voice signals, had been
                    involved. He was independent of the USIS and even of the VOA correspondent in
                    Bangkok. I had never met him. Evidently he had become somewhat intoxicated, had
                    provoked an altercation with an AID officer, and when the latter defended
                    himself, grabbed the man's $250 camera, threw it overboard, pulled out a hunting
                    knife and stabbed the man. Fortunately, the blade struck the AID officer's belt,
                    glanced off, and only penetrated his abdomen superficially, but otherwise, he
                    might have been fatally wounded.</p>
                <p>Inquiry revealed that the assailant had a history of bullying attacks on people,
                    especially, though not only, when drunk. He was reported to beat his (Finnish)
                    wife occasionally, and was an all around belligerent personality. We reported
                    the incident to Washington, and asked for his recall. He came to see me,
                    threatening, defensive. He also visited the Embassy Assistant Administrative
                    Officer who was reporting the matter to DepState. The latter was a black. The
                    assailant tried to intimidate him by saying that where he came from down in
                    North Carolina, they knew how to handle “niggers.” It took about ten days to get
                    him out of Bangkok and back to Washington, where he filed a grievance claim
                    against the Agency that took six months to resolve.</p>
                <p>But the worst effrontery came about a month later. An Embassy officer was
                    listening one morning to the VOA Breakfast show. Suddenly who should be heard
                    but the erstwhile assailant. Evidently looking for some possibly interesting
                    personality to fill in the morning program, the host on the show had flagged him
                    down in the hall, knowing that he had recently come from Bangkok, but unaware of
                    his trouble there, had interviewed him. The guy claimed to be the post Radio
                    Officer, and gave a long exaggerated and scarcely truthful account of his role
                    in Bangkok. The Embassy was outraged. I wrote to Dick Cushing, who was at the
                    time Deputy (perhaps Acting) Director of the Voice, who sent me an explanation
                    of the mistake and an apology. It wasn't one of the Voice's better moments.</p>
                <p>POSTSCRIPT ON THAILAND: When I left Thailand, I was afraid the Thais were losing
                    the battle against the insurgents. A major reason for their success was that
                    China was extensively funding them, as well as helping to impress rural youth
                    out of Thailand, send to a training camp in North Vietnam, then reinfiltrate
                    them into fighting units in Thailand. Somewhat later, China and Vietnam, never
                    historically friendly, had a falling out. Then Nixon opened China to U.S.
                    relations. The Chinese stopped aiding the Thai insurgency, and it gradually
                    faded away. I am convinced to this day, however, that had China sustained its
                    support for the insurgency, the insurgency would have won out. Thailand might be
                    a very different country today.</p>
                <p>1970: Washington—Resource Analysis Staff</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Having been told I was no longer wanted in Thailand, and not wanting to be there
                    any longer myself, I came in for an assignment with the Agency. It was half way
                    a made job, and half way an experiment that Henry Loomis wanted to try out. It
                    was heading up a small element of rather nebulous responsibilities called the
                    Resource Analysis Staff. The idea was that we would analyze resources available,
                    and from our knowledge of program needs would allocate the available resources
                    where most needed. We would make special studies as required, classify posts in
                    descending order of importance for resource purposes, etc.</p>
                <p>Actually, the duties could just as well have been performed by the Office of
                    Administration, and really should have been. As proof of that, it was folded
                    into Administration about a year after I left, and exists no more.</p>
                <p>We did, I think, make a couple of useful studies. One had to do with the value of
                    libraries. Some officers in the Agency doubted their value. It may be that some
                    of them are moribund, but the 15 to 20 we studied in representative countries
                    were booming, and were precious assets to the program. Libraries escaped, for
                    the most part, any emasculation.</p>
                <p>Another investigation had to do with the need for Regional Service Centers—those
                    large in house printing plants that served regional needs for many posts. Then,
                    there were three: Beirut, which has been erased by the troubles of Lebanon;
                    Mexico City; and the original, largest and daddy of them all, Manila. The press
                    service was very concerned, and angry, thinking we were going out with a closed
                    mind to find reasons to dispense with the Centers. I personally was of two
                    minds. We investigated their comparative costs against private contracting in
                    great depth, and came away with irrefutable evidence that their costs could not
                    be beaten, to say nothing of the convenience of having a production plant of
                    that enormous capability at the beck and call of USIS posts alone—no other
                    competition. The Press Service (IPS) was ecstatic.</p>
                <p>I think Henry Loomis, who had initiated the study, was unhappy. Henry had a great
                    bias in favor of private business. A recent inspection of a post where one such
                    plant existed (I think it was Beirut), had included a public member on the
                    inspection team who was from Readers Digest. On the basis of two work days
                    looking at the plant, he had come back in the inspection report with the
                    recommendation that it be scrapped and the posts of the region rely on private
                    printers. Henry would not accept the report we made until I had personally taken
                    a trip up to the Readers Digest aerie in New York, and talked to the guy who had
                    been the inspection team public member. After two or three hours of discussion,
                    he finally agreed the report was ok, with one or two relatively minor changes.
                    On the basis of this, Henry agreed to use it. For some time, it was the
                    definitive report on the Centers, though I imagine by now it's long
                    outdated.</p>
                <p>There were other studies, but not of major significance, and it seemed that their
                    primary use was to throw them as bones for a lot of element heads to chew on,
                    come up, each one, with a pet objection, and haggle over the carcass for
                    weeks.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>After a little more than two years of this, I had had it. When I returned from
                    Thailand, I had made up my mind that if this assignment, which never looked good
                    to me from the start, did not pan out, I would retire before I was so old it
                    would be too late to find anything remunerative on the outside. I felt that
                    under Frank Shakespeare, the Agency was rapidly slipping into mediocrity, and in
                    many places, ridicule. I retired the end of November, 1972. Three months later,
                    Shakespeare resigned, and was replaced by Jim Keogh, a former Time Magazine
                    editor and more recently a White House aide under Nixon. I am told by those who
                    were still in the Agency that morale and reasonableness revived a bit under
                    him.</p>
                <p>I had loved the Agency. It brought me the happiest working years of my life. But
                    I would not have wanted to return, even minus Frank Shakespeare. Retirement was
                    a good decision.</p>
