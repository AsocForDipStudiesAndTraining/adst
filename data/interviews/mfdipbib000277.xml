                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 16, 1994</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 16, 1994. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Willard A. De Pree and is being done on behalf of the Association
                        for Diplomatic Studies and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Bill, could you
                        start off by giving us a little of your background. I notice you were born
                        in the great year of the dragon, 1928.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I am a product of small town America. I am from Zeeland, Michigan, a
                    town of about 5,000 between Holland and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Zeeland was
                    originally settled by Dutch Calvinists, Dutch Reformed. I had a very strict
                    upbringing. Church three or four times on Sunday, once in the middle of the
                    week. My interest in overseas work probably originated right there because we
                    had a number of missionaries who came through and spoke at the church. One in
                    particular, a Dr. Thoms, who had been in Muscat, Oman had some fascinating
                    stories. For a young kid growing up in the mid-West that was excitement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the '30s, too, when you wouldn't have much
                        exposure to overseas affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I guess the furthest I ventured away from home was Chicago. We didn't
                    travel that much. It was the depression years and we didn't have the money to
                    travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your parents do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Well, my father was in the furniture business. My mother grew up,
                    homesteaded in the West. Both had Dutch backgrounds and settled in Western
                    Michigan. I was from a family of five children. I was the middle one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much in the way of foreign history in school?
                        I take it you went through public school.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. The high school offered only American history. They didn't teach
                    Latin. The only language you could take was Spanish. I think I had a year of
                    Spanish and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Dutch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No Dutch. The community was divided into two groups. There was one group
                    that wanted to become totally American; the other group clung to the Dutch
                    culture. My parents were in the first group. They spoke Dutch but didn't teach
                    me Dutch. I regret it now looking back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same experience. My mother spoke German, but it
                        stopped with her, I didn't learn it. You graduated from high school
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: In 1946, and then went to Hope College. That was the school supported by
                    the Dutch Reformed Church and it was five miles from home. I had a full tuition
                    scholarship. I was interested in going to the University of Michigan, but at the
                    time with a whole tuition scholarship I decided to go to Hope with the thought
                    of transferring after a couple of years. After two years I transferred to
                    Harvard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going from Hope to Harvard must have been an experience.
                        How did you find Hope as a college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Oh, fine. Looking back on it I had a couple of outstanding professors
                    who were willing to spend time with me and let me go at the pace that I wanted
                    to go or was able to go. Hope has a fine academic record but was parochial in
                    many respects. I wanted more than that. After two years I applied to Harvard and
                    got a small stipend. I went there for a couple of years. It was a new world for
                    me. I hadn't traveled very much before that. I found I had had it relatively
                    academically easy up to that point. At Harvard I found that I really had to
                    buckle down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular field that you were interested
                        in in Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DE PREE: I had an interest in becoming a university professor or teacher, but was
                    also interested in going overseas. As I mentioned before I had been stimulated
                    by hearing about the work of missionaries. And during the war, of course, a lot
                    of young men from Zeeland went overseas. I heard and read a lot about North
                    Africa, Europe and the South Pacific. There was a National Guard unit in Western
                    Michigan that went off to New Guinea. I majored in political science at Harvard
                    and developed an interest in politics. One summer, while working at my father's
                    store in Zeeland, Jerry Ford, just back from the war, walked in and said that he
                    was running for Congress and asked if I would help him. That sounded exciting,
                    so I agreed to circulate some nominating petitions for him. I stayed in touch
                    with Jerry Ford for many years.</p>
                <p>While I was at Harvard the Zeeland Rotary Club nominated me for one of the Rotary
                    Foundation Fellowships. I was selected and asked if I would be prepared to go to
                    the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, Wales. I had to look on a map to
                    find out where it was. I said, “Yes.” I was excited, this was a real
                    opportunity.</p>
                <p>So I went off for a year. It was a marvelous experience. I studied international
                    politics, concentrating on the period between the wars in Europe. But for me the
                    value was largely just getting overseas and mixing with a lot of people from
                    different backgrounds. The Welsh students were largely from the mining
                    communities. They called themselves Nye Bevan's boys and were strong Labourites.
                    However, they all joined the Tory Club. I couldn't figure out why. It turned out
                    that they could get beer there an half-penny a pint cheaper than in the Labour
                    club. I did a lot of speaking at Rotary Clubs in Wales, England and
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Since we are exact contemporaries, what was your
                        impression when you were in school about the United Nations? I went to
                        Williams from 1946-50 and I remember the United Nations was really the thing
                        that was grabbing us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I too had high hopes for the UN during the immediate post-war period. In
                    1950, when I was in Aberystwyth, the war in Korea broke out and the United
                    Nations provided a useful vehicle to marshal international resistance to the
                    invasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Harvard while you were studying government, what was
                        the impression that you were getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: In retrospect, I guess Harvard reflected the Eastern Establishment's
                    view of world politics, which wanted to see the United States engage actively in
                    international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated from Harvard when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DE PREE: In 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went on to....?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I had a year at the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth. While
                    there I met a lot of students from the British colonies. Quite a number were
                    from Africa - Tanganyika, Uganda, and Mauritius - and I developed an interest in
                    African issues.</p>
                <p>The year abroad was very important in another respect. I had some money left over
                    from the grant at the end of the year and looked around to see where the dollar
                    would stretch the farthest. It was Austria, so I decided to go there to study
                    German. While studying in Salzburg, I met the woman who eventually became my
                    wife five years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Austria at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was still under occupation. The American dollar went a long way
                    there. It was a beautiful country. I didn't delve much into the politics of
                    Austria or the position of Austria in international affairs. I was more
                    interested in the young girl from Sweden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was in the military around the same time, I spent
                        time in Japan. When I came before the Foreign Service Board they asked me
                        about the politics of Japan and I drew a blank. That was not my major
                        preoccupation at that point. So this takes you up to 1951.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: At that point I had developed an interest in the Foreign Service but I
                    wanted first to go on and do graduate work. I had thought I might want to go
                    into politics or teaching, and if so, the University of Michigan seemed a good
                    place to be. So I enrolled at the graduate school in political science. At the
                    time I was still corresponding with Congressman Ford and there was an outside
                    chance that I might be invited to work for him in Washington. Eventually I was
                    offered such a job but I turned it down because by then I had decided to pursue
                    other interests.</p>
                <p>So I went back to Michigan and spent a couple of years there working on a Ph.D. I
                    had a job as a teaching fellow in government. I was a little disappointed with
                    my studies. I was interested in big picture issues, but the graduate school
                    seemed to want to narrow my focus so that I could come up with something
                    original for a Ph.D. thesis. I wanted to move in the other direction.</p>
                <p>I had applied for a Fulbright and had received one to go to the University of
                    Bonn, but the draft board caught up with me at that point and I was drafted into
                    the Army in 1954. By that time I had completed all the required course work and
                    had taken my orals.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I took basic training at Fort Knox and then went overseas to Germany,
                    Heidelberg, where I had a job in psychological warfare research. An enlisted
                    colleague and I occasionally lectured at NATO conferences. He became Dean of the
                    Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Minnesota. Being
                    enlisted personnel, we had orders not to disclose our rank, were given a
                    civilian clothing allowance and billeted in the officers' club.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the Foreign Service begin to appear on the
                        horizon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: During the summer of 1952 I had an internship at the Department of
                    State, working in the Office of British Commonwealth Affairs. I took the Foreign
                    Service exam in Washington that Fall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I took it in Frankfurt in 1954.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: When I was in the Army in Kentucky I was invited to come to Washington
                    for the orals, and fortunately I passed. The oral was brief, only a half hour. I
                    had the exam in the morning and was told that afternoon that I had passed. I
                    decided when in the army that I would defer going back to graduate school, and
                    have a crack at work in the Foreign Service first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I got out of the Army in February in 1956. I had informed the Department
                    that I would be available immediately for Foreign Service work. I was engaged at
                    the time and interested in getting married. At that time, one needed to get
                    permission from the Department to marry a foreigner.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after leaving the army, I was home in Michigan and was called on a
                    Thursday and asked if I could be at work on the following Monday. I accepted at
                    once. The Department didn't tell me what the job was, just to report to a
                    certain office. When I reported in, I was sent off to Cleveland to recruit
                    secretaries for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little glimpse of this. The Foreign Service
                        secretary is really a different breed of cat in this mid '50s than came
                        later on. Where were these women coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DE PREE: They weren't coming fresh out of any secretarial school nor were they
                    unemployed. Most had good secretarial jobs, but had decided that they wanted to
                    try something else and thought work overseas would be exciting.</p>
                <p>Our recruitment team usually was given space in the State employment office. I
                    recall in Atlanta there were two employment offices, one for blacks and one for
                    whites. We started off with our space in the office for the whites. When our
                    team told the state employment staff that the State Department was interested in
                    recruiting black secretaries as well as white secretaries, the Atlanta
                    employment officials politely told us we would have to move to the employment
                    office at the other end of town if we wanted to interview black applicants. They
                    didn't expect us to move, but we did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The interest was there and we began to recruit blacks, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still the days of segregation in the South. Were

                <p>DE PREE: Yes, I was told that we were to make it clear that we were interested in
                    recruits from all races, black and white. The team was warned that we might
                    encounter difficulty in Atlanta.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: When I wasn't recruiting secretaries, I worked in the college relations
                    section arranging recruitment trips for Foreign Service officers to college
                    campuses. After one year in the Employment Division, I entered the A-100 class
                    at FSI.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1957. Can you describe a bit the training
                        you got in the A-100 class, which was the basic officer training
                        course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I thought it was pretty good. At that time consular training was
                    included in the A-100 course. It was taught by Frank Auerbach. I thought our
                    consular training was the best part of the course. It was good hands-on
                    training.</p>

                <p>DE PREE: We had a good class. Larry Eagleburger was in our A-100 class. So was
                    Elinor Greer, now Elinor Constable and Deputy Assistant Secretary in OES. I
                    think I got as much out of my fellow students as I did out of the
                    instructors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a little feel about the group coming in?
                        Each generation is a little different. What was their outlook, those coming
                        in in the '50s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: There was a mix at that time. We were not primarily East Coast Ivy
                    League. We were getting people from the mid and far West. We had a number of
                    women in the class. There were no blacks. Many of us had done some graduate
                    work. Most of the men had had military experience. The average age was probably
                    around 27. At that time, the Department still had an age ceiling of 32, or
                    something like that. I gather the average age of current classes is much
                    older.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I think most of us were trying it out for size. At least I was, and I
                    think a good many of my colleagues were. At that time we weren't quite sure what
                    it was going to be like, life in the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know when I came in I sort of had the feeling that I
                        wasn't sure whether it was my type of work, these diplomats being more
                        social types and all. I just didn't feel comfortable with that. I was
                        relieved to see that the people who came in with me were also of the same
                        background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: In the '50s it was still tough getting into the Service, so one wanted
                    to give it a good try.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DE PREE: It was in Cairo, Egypt. Actually, throughout my career I have had a
                    pattern of assignments being broken at the last minute. In this case I was
                    initially assigned to Elisabethville in the Congo. But when our daughter was
                    born premature, the Medical Bureau thought the medical facilities there were
                    questionable, so I was reassigned to Cairo as vice consul. When we were about to
                    leave Cairo, we were told we would probably be assigned to a post in Africa, but
                    that was changed when a vice consul was shot in Cyprus and we were assigned
                    instead to Nicosia. When I was in INR, I was assigned to go to Kaduna, but that
                    was broken at the last minute because of an unexpected opening in Ghana and I
                    was assigned instead to Accra. While I was in Ghana, we were told we were going
                    to Benghazi, but that was changed when there was a coup in Sierra Leone, and the
                    Department, looking I guess for someone with West African experience, sent us to
                    Freetown instead of Benghazi. So much for the bidding system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's move to Cairo where you were from 1957-58. You
                        were doing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I was vice consul and did citizenship service the first year and visas
                    the second. There were four consular officers in Cairo at the time, the Consul
                    General, his deputy, an officer for the visa side and one for the consular
                    services side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of applicants were coming for citizenship
                        services, where were they coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: There was quite a large resident American community. We also had a
                    number of tourists who lost their passport or had other problems. And we had
                    some prison visitation. On the visa side at that time everyone wanted to go to
                    the United States and our rolls were filled with applicants. We had an excellent
                    FSN staff on whom we depended.</p>
                <p>I learned a number of things about myself at that post. First of all we had
                    instructions at that time not to issue visas to members of the FLN party in
                    Algeria, then resident in Cairo, without first getting an okay from Washington.
                    One afternoon a note came in from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry requesting visas
                    for members of the Egyptian delegation leaving that evening to attend a meeting
                    the nest day at the United Nations. I looked at the list and there were some
                    Algerians of the FLN included as members of the Egyptian delegation. What do you
                    do? Do you deny the Egyptian government the right to appoint whomever they wish
                    to serve on their delegation or do you deny the visas because there wasn't time
                    to get the okay from Washington? Ray Hare was ambassador at the time. I asked
                    him what I should do. He in turn asked me, “What would you suggest?” I said, “I
                    would issue the visas and then send a cable to the Department saying we did it.”
                    Ray said, “That's fine, I will back you up.” I appreciated the confidence the
                    ambassador had shown in me and his willingness to back me up in case I got in
                    trouble. We never had a peep out of Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I also made my share of mistakes. I thought I knew the visa legislation. One day
                    a Swiss citizen, who had a job with the Hilton Hotel, came in for a visa. He
                    wanted to transit through the States to a conference in Canada. He told me he
                    was a resident in the US and wanting to become an American citizen. I advised
                    him that since he was only transiting the States, I would issue him a transit
                    visa, which I said was cheaper and less trouble. “Fine.” He came back in after
                    returning from the conference saying that when he had arrived in New York he had
                    been told that all the time he had spent in the US to become an American citizen
                    had been lost because I had given him the wrong kind of visa. He asked if there
                    was anything I could do. I said I would try my best since I had given him bum
                    advice. I cabled the Department, acknowledged that I had been at fault and urged
                    the Department to take corrective action. A cable came back, wrapping my
                    knuckles, but stating that since I had acknowledged I was at fault, the
                    Department would introduce private legislation. So in the end the man wasn't
                    penalized. I realized that I had better be less sure of myself in the
                    future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you were in the consular section, what was the
                        political situation in Egypt at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was an exciting time because Nasser was at his height. While I was
                    there Egypt formed the union with Syria, the United Arab Republic. It didn't
                    last long but Nasser was strong and very active in the non-aligned movement.
                    There were a large number of political exiles in Cairo. Many would come in for
                    visas.</p>
                <p>It was an opportunity for me as a vice consul to do some reporting because the
                    political section was eager to get information about these people. I developed
                    contacts with a few of the African political exiles. I got to know Felix Moumie
                    of the Cameroon, who was subsequently poisoned, and some of the exiles from
                    Nigeria, who were studying at Al-Azhar University. I did a few reports that the
                    political section welcomed.</p>
                <p>The US wasn't particularly happy with Nasser at the time. We thought he should
                    have been more appreciative of the support we gave him in the Suez war when
                    Eisenhower intervened to halt the British, French and Israelis. But Nasser
                    didn't see it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Ray Hare, who died just last
                        week? What was the general feeling about him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DE PREE: I liked Ray Hare. He went out of the way to make junior officers feel
                    part of the team. It was a strong mission. The deputy was Pete Hart, who
                    subsequently became an assistant secretary. Tony Ross was head of the political
                    section. There was excellent reporting coming out of the unit. We, in the
                    consular section, weren't that close to what was going on. We were separately
                    physically, although in the same compound. We had enough to keep us busy. Once a
                    week we would attend a general staff meeting. I saw some of the political
                    officers because of the side reporting I was doing. At the time I felt that the
                    United States should be making more of an effort to try to work with Nasser. But
                    this wasn't the views of the mission or Washington, who more or less concluded
                    that US-Egyptian relations were not going to improve as long as Nasser was in
                    power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the impression one had and it was reflected by
                        Dulles who couldn't abide Nasser. What was the view of Israel within the
                        embassy at that time? Israel was still a new state and we weren't giving it
                        a lot of support.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: From where we were in Egypt, the fact that the US had been the first to
                    recognize Israel and had a close relationship with Israel didn't help in terms
                    of developing a working relationship with Egypt. Yet it appeared to me that we
                    were being reasonably even handed. We had after all intervened to halt the
                    British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt. Unfortunately Eisenhower's
                    intervention didn't earn us as much credit as we thought it should from the
                    Egyptians and from Nasser.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is your first Foreign Service post. Were you at all
                        tempted to become an Arabist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, I wasn't. I was still interested in Africa. I told the Department
                    when I entered the Service that I was interested in Africa. The Department had
                    originally assigned me to Elisabethville in the Congo, but for medical reasons I
                    had been reassigned to Cairo. In my annual April Fool's bid list, I continued to
                    ask for an assignment in sub-Sahara Africa. But then, in 1958, when I was about
                    due for reassignment from Cairo our vice consul in Cyprus in Nicosia was
                    mistaken for a Britisher and was shot, and the Department needed somebody in
                    Nicosia quickly. Since I had just about completed my two year assignment in
                    Cairo, I was picked. I packed off the wife, and the kids, (at that time we had
                    two kids), to my wife's parents in Sweden while I went off to Nicosia. Once
                    again an African assignment had to wait.</p>

                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: She wasn't all that happy, but took it in stride. I was more
                    disappointed that my family wasn't able to accompany me than I was concerned
                    about going into Cyprus. I had talked to Toby Belcher who was consul general in
                    Nicosia at the time. He reassured me that the Greek Cypriot resistance movement
                    was not targeting Americans. Of course, I realized that I might be mistaken for
                    a Britisher, as had been Basil Wentworth, but it didn't really bother me.</p>
                <p>

                        on Cyprus at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: When I arrived the struggle of the Greek Cypriots for Enosis, or union
                    with Greece, was still raging. General Grivas was the leader of the Greek
                    Cypriote resistance, EOKA. They were engaged in guerrilla activity against the
                    British forces on the island. Sir Hugh Foote was governor at the time. There had
                    been talk of a truce but at the time I arrived they still hadn't reached an
                    agreement. So we had to be very careful where we went. I can recall being
                    invited to a reception at Government House, where we had to be escorted in by
                    military convoy. But there was an air of expectation that agreement on the
                    transition to independence would soon be reached. In fact, it did take place
                    within a few months. With the agreement came a cease-fire.</p>
                <p>My years in Cyprus, 1958-1960 were a promising time to be in Cyprus. Greek
                    Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots were talking and mixing together. The Consulate
                    General was often the site for these meetings. The Consul General, Toby Belcher,
                    was particularly active in bringing Greek and Turkish Cypriots together. Alas,
                    it didn't last very long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling towards Enosis, union with Greece, at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Many of the Greek Cypriots preferred union with Greece to independence,
                    but they began to realize that this probably was not achievable. Therefore, the
                    next best option was independence. The issue then became how much power would be
                    in the hands of the Greek Cypriots who were the majority and what rights would
                    the Turkish Cypriots have. These were sensitive subjects. Neither trusted the
                    other. You could tell the Island was headed for trouble, when the only flags you
                    saw around the island were either the Greek or Turkish flags, not the
                    newly-designed Cypriote flag. I left before independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much of a feeling for the role of the Turks?
                        Were they pretty much a peasantry as opposed to the more commercially minded
                        Greeks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Most Cypriots, Greek or Turkish, were peasants. Some Turkish Cypriots
                    had commercial interests, but the big mines and most commercial trade were
                    largely in the hands of Greek Cypriots. The big banks were controlled by the
                    Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots didn't like it, but that was the situation
                    on the island.</p>
                <p>We had a problem in the consulate general. No American officer on the consulate
                    staff spoke Turkish. Toby Belcher tried hard to treat the two communities
                    equally, but because he spoke Greek there was a perception among some of the
                    Turkish Cypriots that he favored the Greek Cypriots. I gather now the US tries
                    to have at least one Turkish speaker on the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Toby Belcher as a principal officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I thought he was first rate, one of the best officers I worked for. He
                    was good with people, an excellent reporting officer, adept in negotiations, and
                    highly respected by everybody on the island. He didn't stay on to become the
                    first ambassador, but was brought back a couple of years later after fighting
                    broke out again because of the high regard in which he was held by the Greek and
                    Turkish Cypriots on the island.</p>
                <p>Nicosia at the time was a very small part. There was Toby Belcher, myself, a CIA
                    officer, and a rather large administrative support section because of the radio
                    relay station and FBIS station. There was no AID staff, no defense attach�, nor
                    anyone from USIA. That was it. As the vice consul, I doubled as reporting
                    officer and the public affairs officer. It was a great learning experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As public affairs officer, did you have any contact with
                        the local press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We had contact with both Greek and Turkish press. Toby Belcher largely
                    handled these contacts. I did know one or two of the editors. I kept busy with
                    our small exchange program. I also worked to found the Cypriote/American alumni
                    association, which was made up of graduates of American universities, both Greek
                    and Turkish Cypriots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the hand of the American embassy in Athens at
                        all? Were they taking an interest in what was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we did. But the embassy was letting Toby Belcher call the shots in
                    Cyprus. It did not try to treat the Consulate as a constituent post. Actually we
                    had more to do with London, since Cyprus was still a British colony.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The Greeks on the mainland in a sense looked down on the Greek Cypriots.
                    Cypriots were country cousins. But there is a kinship of Greek speakers and the
                    mainland Greeks were supportive and tried to make sure that Greek-Cypriote
                    interests were not shortchanged during the transition to independence. The
                    feeling in Greece was that the Greek Cypriots should have power corresponding to
                    their numerical numbers. They had about 80 percent of the population, and the
                    Turkish Cypriots about 18 percent, as I recall. In this respect the
                    Greek-Cypriots may have been short changed by the London accord.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Grivas appear at all during the time that you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, he came out of hiding. But he wasn't that conspicuous on the local
                    scene. It was Archbishop Makarios, who returned from exile, who captured most of
                    the attention. He was the acknowledged Greek Cypriot leader, not Grivas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the British part of the equation? The Brits
                        were going through a very difficult period all over the world with
                        decolonization. The United States is just sitting back. We had been a colony
                        and basically were opposed to colonialism, etc. Did the British officials
                        that you dealt with kind of resent “you Yanks?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I sensed that there was some of that. A year or two before I arrived on
                    Cyprus, or maybe just shortly before, the British combined the Colonial and
                    Commonwealth Services into a single Service. Cyprus began to get a number of
                    people out of the Colonial Service to serve in the British administration of the
                    island. They had a different mind set. I had the impression that they were more
                    resistant to change than the people in the Commonwealth or diplomatic services.
                    There was a discernible difference. But the differences were largely muted on
                    Cyprus because of the dominant position played by Sir Hugh Foote, who by virtue
                    of his strong personality, was determined that there was going to be a
                    transition to independence and that it was going to take place under his
                    leadership. He was highly respected on the island by all elements.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DE PREE: That reminds me of a delightful story. It involves the governor
                    immediately preceding Sir Hugh Foote, Harding was his name, a general. One of
                    the Greek-Cypriots working at Government House planted a bomb in the bedroom of
                    Governor and Lady Harding, and it went off. No one was in the bedroom at the
                    time so no one was injured. After placing the bomb, the Greek-Cypriote suspect,
                    of course disappeared, joining his colleagues in EOKA. A few weeks after the
                    settlement was reached and the EOKA people came out of hiding, this ex-employee
                    got on a bicycle and peddled off to Government House to request his back pay.
                    Apparently he thought there would be no question, even though he acknowledged
                    that he had been the one who had planted the bomb in Governor and Lady Harding's
                    room.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Our interest largely was to support the transition to independence. We
                    had very few economic interests. There was a pyrites mine which was owned by the
                    American/Cyprus Mining Corporation, but trade was minimal.</p>
                <p>We had a military interest in the two bases, the British Army base at Dhekelia
                    and the British air base at Akrotiri. Even after independence these bases were
                    to be considered to be part of the UK. Given Cyprus' location on NATO's southern
                    flank, we had an interest in this continued British military presence. Perhaps
                    our major interest was to work to ensure that Cyprus not exacerbate the already
                    fragile relationship between our NATO allies, Greece and Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that particular time, did you feel that the problems of

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: They didn't seem to intrude on our work in Cyprus. We had people
                    transiting through Cyprus on their way from Israel to the Middle East, so we had
                    to handle the passport work, otherwise...</p>

                <p>DE PREE: Yes, that is right. We were following developments in the Middle East,
                    but it wasn't a major element of the work done in the consulate general.
                    Cypriots were preoccupied with developments in Cyprus.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, I didn't Stu. I had hoped that after my tour in Cyprus I would
                    finally be assigned some place in sub-Sahara Africa. Instead, the word came that
                    I was to be assigned to Northwestern University for African Studies. I
                    protested, stating that to make it worthwhile I ought to have a tour under my
                    belt before I went to the university. It didn't work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to Northwestern for a year, 1960-61, in
                        African Studies. How would you describe the Northwestern approach and what
                        you were getting out of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was heavy on anthropology. Northwestern had an outstanding
                    anthropology section, headed by Mel Herskovits, who had done some research in
                    West Africa. Northwestern was not as strong in the other social sciences. But
                    there was a very fine African library. I did a lot of reading. The University
                    had a weekly African seminar, which often attracted interesting Africans. But by
                    and large it was a disappointing year. I wanted to get to Africa; I didn't want
                    to sit in a library reading about Africa. My only consolation was that after the
                    year at Northwestern I would get my wish and be assigned to sub-Sahara Africa.
                    But that didn't work out either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Northwestern and Boston University were the two places for
                        African Studies. Looking at it in retrospect, did you feel that Northwestern
                        had any view of Africa that didn't accord with what you later
                        encountered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I have had the impression over the years that academia doesn't quite
                    capture the real world out there, that something is missing, which can only be
                    obtained by residence in the field. There was great enthusiasm in Northwestern
                    and throughout the US for what was taking place in Africa in the late 1950's,
                    early 1960's, which was the heyday of independence. Everybody was excited. In
                    retrospect, I think the media, the US Government and academia oversold Africa to
                    the American public. We didn't foresee the difficulties down the road.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were going to be leading the way and having tremendous
                        influence. We were going to be a very positive influence within the area and
                        bringing it quickly up to standard all over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. At Northwestern too, most everyone thought the sooner the African
                    colonies became independent the better. We thought the British and French were
                    slow in realizing how important it was that these people achieve their
                    independence. In retrospect, one has to ask the question whether everybody would
                    have been better off if the pace had been a little slower.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I thought sure now I would get to Africa I did, but only for a two month
                    orientation trip. A small group of officers interested in Africa - Ed Streator,
                    Tom Thorn, George Sherry, Ray Perkins among them - toured Africa going from West
                    to East, talking to African leaders and embassy people in route. The trip
                    convinced me that I really did want to work in African affairs. But an
                    assignment to the field was not to be. Instead I was assigned to INR to the
                    Office of Research for Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I ended up doing the Horn of Africa in INR and leaving
                        just about the time you arrived. What was the role of INR then and how did
                        you feel it fit into the situation in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I was in INR/RAF at a very fortunate time. This was 1961, at the
                    beginning of the Kennedy Administration. Soapy Williams, former governor of
                    Michigan, had been designated Assistant Secretary for African Affairs. The
                    Kennedy Administration had reservations about Williams. George Ball, who was
                    Deputy Secretary, was looking about for someone in the Department, to keep an
                    eye on the Bureau and Williams for him. That person was Bob Good, who was head
                    of the Office of Research for Africa, in the Bureau of Intelligence and
                    Research. Bob Good came out of one of the universities. In time, the
                    Department's leadership looked to him as its reality check on the African
                    Bureau. Thus, RAF had the attention of the Department's senior policy
                    makers.</p>
                <p>I stayed for three years in INR. There were two big issues that I was concerned
                    with during this period. Ghana was one. Kwame Nkrumah was in power and riding
                    high on the international scene. He was arguably the most influential African
                    leader, at least in the late ''50s and early ''60s, and an important voice in
                    the non-aligned movement. The other issue was the Congo. I didn't have specific
                    country responsibility for the Congo, but Congo issues were dealt with out of
                    our unit, and I had a ringside seat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: West Africa was where the action was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: That's right. West Africa and the Congo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was on the front pages of the paper every day.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: In Ghana the big issue for us was whether the US Government should
                    assist in the construction of the Volta dam. The White House was uncertain. One
                    day it would decide we should go forward, and then Nkrumah would say or do
                    something to make the White House have second thoughts. Eventually, we decided
                    to go ahead with it.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I came into INR, for the first time somebody was
                        saying, “Nkrumah really has charisma.” That was the first time I had ever
                        heard the word and I thought, “Is it fatal, or what?” It had just started to
                        become a buzz word about that time. You were sitting there dealing with
                        Ghana, how were we seeing Nkrumah and wither Ghana with him at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We were unsure, I think, at that time. Obviously he had garnered the
                    respect of most of the black Africans. He was their spokesman. Ghana had become
                    one of the first African states to become independent. He championed
                    independence for all of Africa. Nkrumah had a wide following in the American
                    black community. What got him in trouble with many in the US was his willingness
                    to develop close relations with everybody including the Soviet Union and China.
                    This caused us concern because we were still in an era in which many perceived
                    that you had to be on one side or the other. It was very difficult to be neutral
                    or non-aligned. We weren't sure in what direction his true sympathies lay.
                    Eventually the Kennedy Administration made the decision to go ahead with the
                    construction of the Volta Dam. It was a calculated risk. I thought at the time
                    it was the right decision. I still do.</p>
                <p>But the Congo was the big issue during the three years I was in RAF. It was
                    constantly in the news. We were concerned about a host of things; the
                    instability of the Congolese government, the safety of American citizens, Soviet
                    influence in the country, Tshombe's secessionist movement...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was down in Katanga.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, Katanga. We had hoped that we could restrain Tshombe without having
                    to resort to military force. Eventually, as you know, the UN did send in
                    military units. Tshombe was the target of the UN action. I can recall
                    participating as note taker at a meeting which was called when the fighting in
                    Katanga had reached what appeared to be a decisive stage, where the issue was
                    whether the US should allow the UN forces to achieve a military victory, or
                    whether the US should try to stop them and seek a negotiated settlement. Many of
                    the Department's big guns were there...George McGhee, Governor Harriman,
                    Governor Williams. Opinion was divided, but eventually the group decided to try
                    to persuade the UN Secretary General to call for a cease-fire. Somebody went out
                    of the room to telephone Adlai Stevenson in New York to urge him to intervene
                    with Dag Hammarskjold but they couldn't get Stevenson on the phone. It was then
                    decided that somebody should fly to New York and try to track down Stevenson.
                    (Apparently there was some thought that Stevenson would not want to intervene
                    and might deliberately have left instruction with his staff not to be
                    disturbed.) But it was a very wintry day in Washington and all flights were
                    grounded because of bad weather. As a result, the US did not intervene with the
                    UN and the UN forces defeated Tshombe's forces. There were a number of us
                    working on African affairs who felt that this was fortunate, since a cease-fire
                    would have left the door open for Tshombe to continue to create problems.</p>
                <p>Before we leave my work in INR, I should perhaps mention one other incident,
                    which tells us something about the Kennedy Administration's operating style. I
                    think it was 1963. I was duty officer for RAF. It was on a Sunday and there had
                    been a coup attempt in Togo. The President of Togo, Sylvanus Olympio, had been
                    assassinated and died on the American embassy compound. I went in to the
                    Department to find out more about what had happened and to add an INR comment to
                    a paper that the Department would be sending to the White House. I wrote that
                    the French were the dominant power in Togo, that they seemed to be on top of the
                    situation and that in the circumstances, the US should wait to see how the
                    situation developed before deciding what action, if any, it should take. I sent
                    my comments forward and the next day it came back with the note that this was
                    the Kennedy Administration and it was not appropriate to recommend a policy of
                    doing nothing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like somebody from the political side of the
                        Kennedy Administration just wanting to do something. Well, tell me, in some
                        interviews I can recall having people saying during this period when they
                        would report from an African post that the government is ineffective, there
                        is a lot of corruption, etc., they would sometimes get a rocket back from
                        Soapy Williams or from his office, essentially saying that you don't report
                        nasty things. Did you have any feeling that in INR you were supposed to be
                        sort of the honest broker, that you were kind of looking for things beyond
                        some of the reporting? Did you feel there was a muzzle on or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I didn't sense that during the period I was there. I had the impression
                    on the basis of the reports that I was seeing that the posts were calling the
                    shots pretty much as they saw them. I think there may have been a general
                    disposition within the US government to view some of these adverse developments
                    as inevitable and not to get too alarmed by a turn in the road that doesn't go
                    in the direction we had wanted it to go. But I didn't have the impression that
                    we were carried away with that. That came a little later I think. This is still
                    1961-64. I certainly didn't sense there was a muzzle on us in INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the Soviet influence at that time?
                        Did that weigh heavily?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It did. It was always there. The Chinese were also very, very active in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you doing papers about what the Soviets and the

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Very much so. What were the Soviets' interests? What were they up to,
                    where could they make inroads into our major interests in Africa? Some of us in
                    INR thought the US did too much worrying. Maybe it would be a good thing if the
                    soviets would take over some small African country. Someone suggested Zanzibar.
                    It was an island off the mainland. Let the Soviets have it; See what they could
                    do with it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding at that time dealing with West Africa
                        that you were in collision some times with the European Bureau, particularly
                        because of the French. The British had pretty well washed their hands of it
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The French very much so. We were very much interested in what the French
                    were up to. We never felt we were on top of what they were doing.</p>

                        that the French were playing us? This was before the French pulled out of
                        NATO, but de Gaulle was being de Gaulle. Did you have the feeling that the
                        French were using the European NATO card to keep us from getting involved in
                        Africa or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I didn't have a sense particularly of a NATO card, but the French did
                    play on our efforts to counter Soviet activity in the continent to their
                    advantage. Also, the French would constantly remind us that they had been in
                    Africa a long time and understood the Africans better then we did and that we
                    didn't appreciate the long term consequences of some of our actions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Most of us in RAF took the view that the blacks in South Africa would
                    eventually obtain independence and majority rule. But we also knew the whites
                    would resist. It was thought the struggle in South Africa was some years off;
                    probably a decade or more.</p>

                <p>DE PREE: Yes, it was coming and it was inevitable and couldn't be stopped. The

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The European Bureau saw this as largely a European issue. The resistance
                    movement in Angola and Mozambique didn't really begin until the tail end of my
                    tour in INR. It was felt that the movement for independence was going to have to
                    run its course in these territories as well, but that the Portuguese had a bit
                    more time and that they would benefit from what happened in the British and
                    French colonies.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I don't know; I wasn't reading the daily traffic from the Portuguese
                    Territories. I had the impression that our embassy in Lisbon may have been
                    putting a metropole spin on the reporting of developments in Mozambique and
                    Angola.</p>

                        suppose, were the thing. But really talking about Portuguese Africa just
                        didn't come up on your radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, that is right. It hadn't come up on the screen as yet. Everybody
                    was thinking it was inevitable, it is going to happen there, but we were
                    preoccupied with the Congo and the British and French colonies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our policy was then and it is now, that African boundaries
                        may not make much sense but if you start breaking away from them you are
                        talking about absolute chaos because of the tribal patterns. Was there any
                        dissent or any feeling in INR that maybe the tribal things are
                        un-overcomeable and maybe we should take another look at this policy or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, there wasn't. None of that at the time. Nobody questioned that.
                    Everybody thought that the boundaries divided so many tribes that you didn't
                    want to touch this one. Once you did there would be no end to the unraveling. I
                    did a paper at Northwestern University on this question of boundaries cutting
                    across tribal units, and I concluded in that paper, as I think the Department
                    concluded, that the US had best live with the current boundaries. It was also
                    the view of the African leadership at the time. They didn't want to touch it
                    either.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At least it was a problem all over and it makes sense.
                        Once you start, and we are learning that right now, we are having a nasty
                        civil war in former Yugoslavia of the same nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Apparently, there are some Africanists today who suggest that Africa
                    might be more governable or manageable if the tribe were the basic unit of
                    governments. But at that time there wasn't any of that. The issue surfaced
                    significantly at the time Biafra wanted to separate from Nigeria, but that was
                    later.</p>

                        the judgment, if you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we were getting intelligence collected by the CIA. I think the
                    African area was relative easy for the CIA to operate in. It was quite easy to
                    buy information. But the best reporting was still coming out of our posts in
                    Africa. I don't think we had a problem of access so much in Africa. You could
                    talk to people. You just had to have people who spoke the language on the spot
                    to dig out the information. The area where the Agency was good was finding out
                    what the Soviets, Chinese and other supporters of the Soviet bloc at that time
                    were up to. That was the area where intelligence from the CIA was very
                    useful.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>DE PREE: I don't know. Our relationship with the British has always been a close
                    one. We were sharing intelligence. We were periodically meeting with the British
                    to discuss country by country what their views were and what our views were.
                    That was also true with the French although I don't think there was as much
                    sharing as with the British. So on British East Africa, we were probably getting
                    pretty good information from the British, to the extent that the British were on
                    top of developments.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Guinea had opted to break its relationship with France, which prompted
                    de Gaulle, of course, to pull out, to unscrew the light bulbs, as the story
                    goes, and leave them on their own. Of course, Sekou Toure was heavily supported
                    by the Soviet Union and China. For the longest time we were concerned that he
                    might permit the Soviets to establish a military base in Guinea. However, in
                    time, Sekou Toure became disillusioned with his relationship with the East and
                    realized that it was in Guinea's interest to have a relationship with both
                    sides, including us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: When I was in INR, it was, although President Kennedy appointed
                    political supporters as ambassadors - Bill Attwood in Guinea, Bill Mahoney in
                    Ghana, both of whom made a college try at winning over Sekou Toure and Nkrumah.
                    I think Mahoney in Ghana had more success than Bill Attwood. Bill Attwood, I
                    think, became disillusioned sooner than Mahoney. Sekou Toure gave us more
                    concern than Kwame Nkrumah.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We had two routes. Obviously, for those of us at the working level in
                    INR, our contacts were at Desk level, both in EUR and AF. But RAF's director,
                    Bob Good, had direct access to George Ball who had a great deal of confidence in
                    Bob Good and wanted RAF's independent judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Desk officers sometimes wondering what you were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>DE PREE: No, at the working level I think there was an excellent relationship and
                    sharing of information. Many on the Desk had graduated out of INR. It wasn't
                    “we” against “them.” Everybody was trying to do the best job they could.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kennedy died shortly before you left, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: That is right, in 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this have any repercussions on how things were dealt
                        with or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Kennedy was held in high esteem by almost everybody in black Africa.
                    They thought he cared. They had access to him. During the Kennedy Administration
                    I was a member of the African luncheon group, made up of people working on
                    Africa from all agencies, which met once a month for lunch and a program. I was
                    president of the group for a time. We hosted people like Roy Welensky of
                    Rhodesia, Kenneth Kaunda, and African leaders visiting Washington. One time I
                    invited Martin Danquah, who was head of the Agricultural Workers Union of Ghana,
                    to speak to the luncheon group. Even a person of his standing was able to get in
                    to see President Kennedy. This obviously paid off. People in Africa were
                    devastated by Kennedy's death, as in the United States.</p>
                <p>If we can jump ahead, when I was assigned to Ghana from 1964 to 1968, the embassy
                    received copies of the film that USIA had put out entitled, “Years of Lightning,
                    Day of Drums,” about the Kennedy Administration. You probably remember it Stu.
                    Shortly before that film was produced, the embassy had sent the regional
                    governors of Ghana to the United States for a tour. They had been escorted by
                    Jack Matlock, who was then an officer at the embassy in Ghana. When the film
                    arrived, the embassy decided to show it around Ghana at each of the regional
                    capitals. I can recall going up to Bolgatanga with Jack Matlock. The governor
                    put the screen in the middle of the town square and thousands of people, seated
                    on all sides of the screen, showed up to see it. It was incredible, the reaction
                    and feeling of black Africa toward Kennedy and the Kennedy Administration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: After INR, I was assigned to go to Kaduna as principal officer. This was
                    the summer of 1964. Shortly before I was due to leave, however, Bill Edmondson,
                    who was chief of the political section in Ghana, had to curtail because his son
                    had an accident which required medical treatment in the US Oliver Troxel who was
                    DCM in Accra, asked if I would be interested in the job. I was. Nkrumah was
                    still in office and Accra was where the action was in Africa. So my assignment
                    to Kaduna was broken and I was assigned to replace Bill Edmondson.</p>

                        did you feel any change in interest or not from the top?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No. I didn't sense any change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two questions before we leave this because this is a very
                        interesting period we are talking about. This is sort of the discovery of
                        Africa by the United States. What about Rhodesia at that time? How were
                        things playing out there from our perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I guess there were two main issues. One, was whether the Central African
                    Federation, comprising Rhodesia, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, would hold
                    together. Of course, it didn't.</p>
                <p>The second issue was whether the British would grant independence to Rhodesia and
                    if so, under what circumstances? Would they insist on participation by the
                    blacks in the government of an independent Rhodesia? Of course, Ian Smith and
                    the white Rhodesians jumped the gun and declared their own independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during your watch?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was more or less on the stove but hadn't boiled
                        over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we were hopeful that the Rhodesians would begin to bring the blacks
                    into the government and there would be a multiracial government in Rhodesia, but
                    it wasn't a burning issue at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Last question on this, what about aid? Was the aid program
                        going on and you really didn't know what was happening, were we getting any
                        feedback that it was doing what we think it should be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: INR was very much interested in aid. The thinking of the time was that
                    Africa had great promise. You may recall that Walt Rostow's book, “Stages of
                    Economic Growth,” was popular at the time. In the book, Rostow looked at what
                    conditions were needed to bring countries to the stage of self-sustaining
                    growth. Many African countries were thought to qualify.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where you reach a certain point and take off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, what level of technology, training, infrastructure or trade was
                    required. I can remember attending a meeting in the Department, on Sierra Leone,
                    a country I subsequently served in, where we debated in all seriousness, what
                    inputs of aid were needed to bring Sierra Leone to the point of self-sustaining
                    growth. So, indeed, aid was a significant factor in our work. And, of course, in
                    Ghana one of the key policy issues was whether the US would guarantee funding
                    for the Volta River project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Volta River project, was the Aswan high dam sort
                        of thrown in our face? Was this a factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes it was. Before we went forward we wanted to make sure we would carry
                    through to completion. We didn't want to say yes, then later to call a halt to
                    it. President Kennedy sent Clarence Randall, a prominent industrialist, to Accra
                    to talk with the door closed to Kwame Nkrumah and to come back with a
                    recommendation whether to proceed. If I recall it wasn't a very clear cut
                    recommendation. It left the question open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop here and pick up next time with your
                        going to Ghana, 1964-68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a continuing interview with Willard De Pree. We
                        are going to take you at last to Africa, to Accra where you served for four
                        years, from 1964-68. How did you feel about that assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Eager. As you know I waited many years to get to Africa. Finally here
                    was my chance. I had initially been assigned to Kaduna which I think I mentioned
                    in our previous discussion. That was broken because Bill Edmondson, who was head
                    of the political section in Accra had to return to the States for family
                    reasons. Oliver Troxel, the DCM, asked me if I would be interested in going out
                    to replace Bill. I had to be repaneled but I was pleased with the assignment.
                    Kwame Nkrumah was riding high in Ghana and that's where the action was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ghana was sort of the focal point of almost everything of
                        American interests at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DE PREE: That's right, and Ghana was the first sub-Saharan black African state
                    after World War II to achieve independence and Nkrumah was active not only in
                    Africa but in the non-aligned movement. Everyone was there. All the foreign
                    diplomatic missions had strong missions because Ghana was in the limelight. So I
                    was pleased with the assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I was chief of the political section. Bill Mahoney, a political
                    appointee of President Kennedy's, was Ambassador and Oliver Troxel was DCM. We
                    had a four-person political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out there did you talk to anyone on the
                        desk or elsewhere in the African Bureau? What were our interests as far as
                        you gathered from the State Department and all, when you went out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: As I said, Nkrumah was active, Ghana was active, and our hope was that
                    the policies he pursued would on balance be in Western interests. Our concern
                    was that he was being courted by the Soviet Union, Red China and he responded
                    positively, letting himself quite often, in our judgment, be used to promote
                    their global interests.</p>
                <p>We also wanted to keep tabs on what he was up to in Africa. There were reports
                    that Ghana was training Nigerians and some Francophone Africans to subvert
                    governments back in their home countries. It was in our interest to try to find
                    out what he was up to.</p>
                <p>We also reported on the activities of the other diplomatic missions in Accra,
                    particularly the Soviets and the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation like when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was mixed. In general, Ghanaians were pleased with Ghana's influence
                    and the attention Ghana was receiving. But internally the cocoa farmers were
                    unhappy. The price the government paid them for their cocoa was far less than
                    the price cocoa commanded on the international market. The government was buying
                    the cocoa cheap and selling it at a better price, or hoping to sell it at a
                    better price...quite often it miscalculated and sold it prematurely. Trades
                    people were unhappy because of regulations that were being imposed on their
                    activities. The economy wasn't perking along as Ghanaians had hoped it would and
                    disgruntlement was beginning to set in.</p>
                <p>In addition, many were unhappy over Nkrumah's close relations with the communist
                    regimes.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there how were the officers in the political
                        section feeling about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We had a strong section. Foreign Service officers bid on Ghana because
                    of what was taking place there. The number two in the political section was Jack
                    Matlock, who subsequently became our Ambassador to the Soviet Union. The number
                    three was Tom Walsh and there was a junior officer. All of us in the Political
                    Section liked the assignment because Ghanaians are a delightful people,
                    engaging, well-educated, and easy to get to know, including government
                    officials. There was a strong cadre of civil servants, particularly in the
                    Foreign Ministry. If we needed information we just called somebody in the
                    Government and generally were able to get the information we were looking
                    for.</p>
                <p>The other diplomatic missions were a good source of information. The Nigerians,
                    for example, saw themselves as rivals of Ghana in West Africa. Ghana at that
                    time was supporting opposition elements in Nigeria. People in the Nigerian
                    embassy were well aware of what Nkrumah was doing and readily shared their
                    information with us. So Accra was an exciting place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Nkrumah trying to do as far as subverting
                        Nigeria, or was this pretty much felt this was what he was trying to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Well, I think he was impatient. He wanted all of black Africa to be
                    truly independent. If the government that assumed power at independence was
                    maintaining what in his judgment was too close a relationship to the former
                    Metropole, he was unhappy. In most African countries there were some people who
                    agreed with Nkrumah, who talked his language. Lumumba in the Congo was one.
                    There were some in Nigeria. Nkrumah supported these people financially and
                    occasionally with military training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there were you seeing indications of
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we were getting information. Nkrumah separated his conduct of
                    diplomacy. He had a Foreign Ministry and an African Affairs Secretariat. It was
                    the African Affairs Secretariat that promoted Nkrumah's wishes in Africa. It was
                    this organization that operated the ideological and military training camps that
                    were located in the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>In the four years I was there, there were a couple of coups in Africa that could
                    be traced back directly to people who had been trained in Ghana. There was a
                    camp in Winneba, just west down the coast from Accra, where African radicals
                    received their ideological training. Some of these people subsequently led
                    opposition movements or engaged in subversion in independent Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the hand of the British left wing Socialist
                        movement coming out of the London School of Economics in Nkrumah's
                        economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: That was certainly there. Fabian socialism and the trade union movement.
                    But Nkrumah, of course, pretended that he was coming up with something
                    different, something unique. “Consciencism” was the title of one of his books.
                    The political section had to try to analyze it. It was almost an impossible
                    task, a mixed bag of anti-colonial, anti-imperialist rhetoric. A good many
                    Ghanaians had studied in Russia and Eastern Europe. Generally we found that
                    these people were not too difficult to deal with. From their experience in
                    Eastern Europe and Russia, they realized there was a wide gap between communist
                    rhetoric and communist practice. They found racism to be very prevalent.</p>

                        revolt from Bulgaria of all the African students. They all came through my
                        office in Belgrade asking to get to school in the West. We placed a lot of
                        them in schools in the West. They were tired of being called black monkeys
                        by the Bulgarians. They were not the most subtle people.</hi>

                <p>DE PREE: Ghanaians who had lived in the Soviet Union came back with their eyes
                    open. Quite often graduates of American universities and the UK created more
                    problems for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude at that time towards these efforts
                        to subvert other countries? Did we just sit back and watch or pass word on
                        to the other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We were pretty much sharing information that we had with respect to what
                    Ghana was engaged in. And, of course, we shared too what we knew about Soviet
                    activities.The Nigerians had a very active mission and they were passing
                    information to their African colleagues. So it wasn't as if other African
                    governments were oblivious to what was taking place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the Nigerians and other black African diplomats, were
                        you getting from them that their view of Nkrumah was not a benevolent
                        one?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>DE PREE: That's right. For most of the time I served in Ghana there was division
                    in sub-Saharan Africa between the radicals (the pro-Nkrumah camp) and the
                    moderates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we being active trying to tell Nkrumah to cool it or
                        something or at that point were we just sitting back and being rather
                        passive and watching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, we certainly were not passive. This was the immediate post-Kennedy
                    period. We were concerned with our own problems in Vietnam, of course, but we
                    were not sitting back. We were frank in our discussions. Ambassador Mahoney had
                    an exceptional relationship with Nkrumah, in retrospect, maybe the relationship
                    was too close. Nkrumah may have felt that he could do pretty much what he wanted
                    and Ambassador Mahoney would understand. Not that he did, of course. But if we
                    had somebody a little more aloof who could go in and say, “Look, this is what we
                    know you are doing and we don't like it,” Nkrumah might have taken more heed.
                    The close personal relationship may have led to some misunderstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it reminds me of Howard Jones in Indonesia with
                        Sukarno. They were very close and Sukarno would twit Jones and kid him, and
                        Jones would just take it because he felt he had this very close
                        relationship. And yet it didn't work out to our advantage there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Ambassador Mahoney didn't mince his words with Nkrumah but Nkrumah may
                    not have taken what Mahoney was saying as seriously as he would have had they
                    not been so close. We used to talk about it in the mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk to Mahoney about it too, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, it was something that we talked about. I had a good deal of respect
                    for Mahoney.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Mahoney's background? He was a political
                        appointee.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He was a lawyer and had been Kennedy's campaign manager in Arizona,
                    maybe more than Arizona. He was one of several political appointees in Africa.
                    There was Bill Attwood in Guinea, Kaiser in Senegal. Before, as you know, most
                    political appointees went to Europe, but under the Kennedy Administration a lot
                    of them found themselves in the third world. For the most part they were
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Soviets and the Communist
                        Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>DE PREE: At that time it was a confrontation, a rivalry. We concluded that what
                    they were engaged in was not in our interests. To the extent that they were able
                    to develop a close relationship with Ghana or other African states, we were
                    unhappy. Many people viewed it as an either/or situation. One either had to be
                    pro-West or one was on the other side. Oh, there was some sophistication, but
                    this still was the prevailing mind-set in the way we looked at Soviet and
                    Chinese activities. There was, of course, a Soviet and Chinese rivalry that
                    developed, and you could sense that and see that. We reported that to
                    Washington. The Soviets and Chinese were, themselves, competing for African
                    support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the Soviets up to as far as we could see during
                        this period, 1964-68?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I think they were trying to cultivate leaders in Africa who would side
                    with them on global issues. They wanted to stir up trouble for the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they doing? Aid projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The Soviets had a large aid program, primarily economic rather tan
                    military. A lot of Ghanaians were being trained in the Soviet Union. Our aid in
                    Ghana captured more attention because we were facilitating funding for the Volta
                    Dam, which in turn, generated the power for Kaiser's alumina smelter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking around and saying, “My God, the Soviets
                        are here and we had better get into this field too?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we didn't want to leave the field open to them. We were competing.
                    We had the good fortune, of course, that Ghana is English speaking. And far more
                    Ghanaian officials had been trained in the West and were familiar with the UK
                    and the US than with the Soviet Union. We had an advantage over the Soviets.</p>
                <p>Throughout my tour in Ghana, US funding and support for the Volta River project
                    and the smelter was the most contentious bilateral issue. Kaiser had a very
                    strong team in Ghana. We were very close to Kaiser officials. Edgar Kaiser used
                    to come to Ghana a couple of times a year. It was always seen as a big event in
                    Ghana. The State Department and embassy always briefed Edgar Kaiser before he
                    saw Nkrumah so that he was privy to the state of US-Ghana relations. We hoped
                    Edgar Kaiser would use his influence with Nkrumah to further US interests in
                    Ghana and Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>A little sidelight. Nkrumah enjoyed novelties. Every time Edgar Kaiser came to
                    Ghana, he would have something special by way of a gift or a novelty for
                    Nkrumah. One time he presented a toy blimp that could be directed by remote
                    control. He gave that to Nkrumah in his office and throughout the conversation
                    that little blimp was hovering over the conversation. I guess it was rather
                    distracting.</p>
                <p>Edgar Kaiser was concerned too with what was taking place in Ghana, but had
                    negotiated what he considered a very favorable arrangement both for Kaiser and
                    Ghana, and stuck with the project, as did Nkrumah. The smelter turned out to be
                    one of Kaiser's most profitable investments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was funding the Volta Dam, itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was multiple funding. The construction of the smelter, and Kaiser's
                    agreement to purchase the power at a fixed price made construction of the Dam
                    viable. The US guaranteed some of the loans which financed the Dam, which was
                    built by Kaiser. There was international funding, the World Bank, and Ghanaian
                    funding as well. So it was a multiple funded project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With these aid projects, how did we at that time view the
                        problem of corruption? Was it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was there. In retrospect, looking back on my experience in Sierra
                    Leone and Bangladesh, it was there but it wasn't as blatant or as pervasive.
                    Some of the money no doubt found its way to Nkrumah, not so much for his own
                    personal gain, as to promote his political wishes throughout Africa. Some of his
                    ministers, however, were living far beyond their governmental salaries. That was
                    beginning to irritate the Ghanaians. You could see the unhappiness setting in.
                    Civil servants, police and military, began privately to express their concern.
                    The army was unhappy with the creation of Nkrumah's presidential guard, which
                    was viewed as a rival to the professional army. Senior police officials were
                    unhappy at the way corruption was beginning to find its way into their service.
                    And as you know, eventually some of the police and some the military, General
                    Ankrah and Chief of Police Harley and his deputy Deku got together and plotted
                    the coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was the coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>DE PREE: The coup took place in 1966 while Nkrumah was in China on his way to
                    Vietnam. He had approached us before the trip asking if we would support his
                    efforts to negotiate a cease fire or settlement in Vietnam. The Johnson
                    Administration was convinced that nothing good would come of Nkrumah's efforts,
                    but we didn't want to publicly discourage him, so we indicated that we would be
                    interested in whatever he could find out, without encouraging him in any way. It
                    was while he was in China that the police and the army moved against him and
                    toppled him. Many of those who were with Nkrumah came back, but Nkrumah never
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For an embassy a coup is always a highlight of one's
                        professional business. Had you, the embassy and the political section been
                        sort of paving the way saying this could happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We reported what we were hearing in Ghana. The unhappiness with Nkrumah
                    and rumors of some plotting had been reported back to Washington. So a coup was
                    not that unexpected, although when it occurred it came as a surprise and caught
                    a lot of people unaware. The army and police obviously took advantage of his
                    being out of the country to stage and carry out the coup. There was some
                    fighting around Flagstaff House, which was Nkrumah's offices, but for the most
                    part resistance was short-lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well was the country team plugged into what the

                        and all. How were relations with the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Relations were very good. Many of the senior officers had fought in
                    World War II in Burma. They had been trained by the British. They were friendly
                    to the West. Our Defense Attach� had very good contacts. So too did many of us
                    in the embassy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the CIA? Were they giving you information or
                        were they sort of operating their own show?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: They were sharing the information with us. As I say, it was easy to
                    collect intelligence of what was going on. You just had to have stamina.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Partly. This was a good way to meet Ghanaians. They are an outgoing
                    people, who generally let you know what they are thinking. Many would share
                    information about what they were up to.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>There was no division within the embassy, the country team worked together. It
                    was a well-run mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about with reporting? You had Soapy Williams as head
                        of African Affairs still at that time. Every once in a while in these

                        warts in a country because Soapy Williams wanted to hear good news of black
                        Africa. Did you have any feeling about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, we didn't sense that at all. There were no suggestions that our
                    reporting was getting out of line. We reported developments as we saw them. That
                    wasn't a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this new group came in what was our immediate
                        reaction as to where they were coming from and what they were going to do as

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Many people saw the removal of Nkrumah as an advantage or plus for the
                    West. However, a military takeover was not something we were trying to promote
                    throughout Africa. We perceived it to be in US interest to persuade the people
                    who took over the National Liberation Council, the military and police, to
                    schedule elections and return to civilian rule. We pressed hard as a mission to
                    get them to commit themselves to do that, and they did it. Again in retrospect
                    some people think they probably moved too quickly because the government that
                    came in after the National Liberation Council proved to be ineffective. The
                    country started to go down hill. The Busia government couldn't get on top of the
                    situation. But we didn't foresee that and we pressed the National Liberation
                    Council hard to hold early elections. And they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say pressed hard, here was a country where our

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was. We had good influence. We had had access to Nkrumah and the
                    government of the day, but they didn't listen to us. In Harley, Ankrah and Deku,
                    we had three leaders who were close to the West. They listened. They had no
                    experience in running the government. They looked to the West, the United States
                    and Britain, for advice on what to do. Both the British and we urged them to
                    schedule early elections, to get on with the job of transition and the return to
                    civilian rule. They were hesitant, wanting to go a little slower than we were
                    urging them to go.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Soviet and the Chinese when the coup came?
                        What did this do to their activities?</hi>

                <p>DE PREE: A good many of the people in the Soviet embassy left. A number had been
                    training Nkrumah's own bodyguards. They suffered some casualties, as I recall,
                    when the army took over Nkrumah's residence. The new government that came in
                    made it clear that they wanted a different relationship with the Soviet and
                    Communist missions. They didn't break relations, but relations were much
                    cooler.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I guess the Spring before the coup. The coup was in the Fall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Franklin Williams's background and how did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He had been active in the Democratic Party, a supporter of President
                    Johnson. He had a law background. He came in questioning US government policy
                    with respect to Nkrumah. I think he thought the US was too critical of Nkrumah.
                    He was also critical of the Foreign Service. I can remember he came in and told
                    us that he didn't think much of the Foreign Service. We were going to do things
                    his way and we had better get on board. He was rather open about the whole
                    thing. But over time he began to realize that he had inherited a darn good staff
                    and that changed. He, too, became discouraged with what was taking place in
                    Ghana. Then, of course, the coup came he developed a good relationship with the
                    National Liberation Council. He was not the easiest ambassador to work for. He
                    talked quite a bit, out of school. Information that we were picking up we
                    obviously shared with him. But he wasn't able to keep some of the sensitive
                    information within the embassy. So we began to be a little reluctant to share
                    everything with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody able to kind of talk to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we told him he should be more careful. Some of the leaders of the
                    post-coup government also were unhappy with his loose tongue. He would share
                    rather freely what the Ghanaian leaders were telling him, which he should not
                    have done.</p>

                        professional, at time of fast change and all this, would have made more
                        sense then to have somebody who is playing the normal political game of
                        glad-handing and going out and around.</hi>

                    book he planned to write upon completion of his tour as ambassador. It would
                    have better in my judgment to have had someone more professional as ambassador
                    at that time.</p>

                        I imagine this must have driven us wild because this was the one place where
                        a country like Ghana can kind of stick it to the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: And they did under Nkrumah. Ghana quite often voted in opposition to the
                    way we voted. After the change of government we found that Ghana was lining up
                    with us on almost all significant issues. So in that sense we were far better
                    off after the coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the British there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The British at independence had a very good relationship with the
                    government. The British had been helpful in moving Ghana towards independence
                    and it was appreciated. But over the post-independence period, this relationship
                    began to erode, while our relationship began to be perceived by Ghanaians as
                    more important. There were several reasons for this. I think the big reasons was
                    that we were the global power. Moreover, we had funded and made possible the
                    Volta River project, which was the biggest development project in the country.
                    We had a very active mission, but the British did too. We shared information
                    fully with our British colleagues. However, I think we were one step ahead of
                    the British in knowing what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still in Foreign Service terms, high Africa,
                        wasn't it? I mean Africa was still a place where the eager, high charging
                        young officer might aim for.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Well, yes, Ghana was the place to be. Certainly as long as Nkrumah was
                    there and also in the immediate post-coup period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the coup always sends adrenaline through one's veins
                        anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>DE PREE: It certainly does. I can remember the night of the coup I woke up and
                    could hear the shooting. We lived on the outskirts of the town near the airport
                    and from our roof I could see the tracer bullets. I decided I had better get
                    into the mission. I decided that on the way I would drive by the Flagstaff House
                    to see what was going on. As I got close to Flagstaff House a car about a
                    hundred yards in front of me blew up and I knew that wasn't the place for me. A
                    soldier came out of the bushes and told me to get the hell out of there. I
                    didn't have to be told, and I high tailed it to the mission by way of a back
                    road. My adrenaline was high at the time.</p>
                <p>The final two years I was in Ghana the embassy was busy getting to know the new
                    people. I developed a close relationship with the head of the new trade union
                    movement, a fellow by the name of Ben Bentum, who was helpful in rallying
                    support for the new government. But I was not happy with some of the people who
                    were obviously going to find themselves in positions of power under a civilian
                    government once elections took place. Many in the new government were rather
                    vindictive. Admittedly, some of them had come out of years in prison, but it
                    seemed to me that Ghana needed to look ahead rather than to the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the trade union movement? I think one of
                        the most pernicious things that the British exported has been its trade
                        union and labor movement which tends to be very class orientated. It is
                        divisive. How was it translating in Ghanaian terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: There is a class difference. Most of the trade union people didn't have
                    the education that people in the bureaucracy had, for example, or the military
                    services and the police had. But in Ghana extended families had members in the
                    bureaucracy, the military and the trade unions. Although there was a difference
                    in income it wasn't as noticeable as you might find in Europe, for example. And,
                    of course, trade unions at this time were quite powerful in Africa. They could
                    bring out people for rallies and for elections. In Ghana in the immediate
                    post-coup period the trade unions played a very constructive role.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left just before the coming into power of a duly
                        elected government in Ghana in 1968. What was your next assignment and how
                        did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: A few months before leaving Ghana I was informed that I was being sent
                    as principal officer to Benghazi, Libya. Quite frankly I was looking forward to
                    it. I had been four years in West Africa and was ready for a change. But shortly
                    before we were due to leave a cable came in telling me that my orders had been
                    broken and I was going to Sierra Leone as counselor of embassy, as number two at
                    the embassy. And that was it. I thought Sierra Leone was going to be more of the
                    same. It was still in West Africa just up the coast, a former British
                    colony...in that sense we were pleased because we loved the Ghanaians. But when
                    we got to Sierra Leone, in the Fall of 1968, we found it quite different from
                    Ghana.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1968-70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was different in the sense that independence in Ghana had really
                    brought about significant change. Things were different; the Ghanaians sensed
                    that. They really had had a revolution. This was not true in Sierra Leone. In
                    Sierra Leone power had been transferred from the UK to Sierra Leoneans. Siaka
                    Stevens was in power, was Prime Minister, but many people felt they hadn't had
                    their revolution, that they really hadn't broken their ties with the UK as had
                    the Ghanaians. Freetown had been settled by slaves that the British picked up
                    off the high seas and returned to Freetown. This tribally-mixed Creole community
                    as it was called was comparable to the African-American community in Liberia.
                    The Creoles were very Victorian in their outlook. Most of them had trained in
                    the UK and were much more concerned with form than substance. Creole-rule was
                    akin to colonial rule but with a black face. The up country tribal peoples had
                    little say in government. This was not the case in Ghana.</p>
                <p>I had a fellow working for me in the embassy, the commercial Foreign Service
                    National, a Creole who had a card which gave not only his name, but an exam that
                    he had sat in the UK, with the notation that he had failed the exam. I couldn't
                    figure out why one would pass out a card noting that the person had failed an
                    exam. Well, to the Sierra Leonean, it was important that he had reached the
                    point where he was qualified to sit the exam. That elevated him above most of
                    his Sierra Leonean colleagues, who never sat an exam. Again, form over
                    substance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: So my wife and I discovered that one ex-British colony could be quite
                    different from another. From this I concluded that one must be careful when
                    generalizing about black Africa. The differences between one country and another
                    can be enormous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sierra Leone is basically a river bank isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It is located along the Sierra Leone River. It had everything going for
                    it at independence. It had the best university in West Africa, Fourah Bay
                    College. It had an able civil service, trained by the British. The police and
                    military were professional. It was exporting rice. It had ample foreign exchange
                    earnings through export of diamonds and iron ore. Its government was
                    pro-Western. We had influence. We had an AID program. They looked to the West
                    for support. It had good roads and an excellent port. It had a multiparty
                    political system, a free market economy. It seemed to have everything going for
                    it. But yet it was going down hill. I returned...I will jump ahead 25 years...a
                    year ago to Sierra Leone to inspect the embassy. The country had gone to pot. A
                    number of coups had taken place. The government was run by young army officers,
                    some of whom were on drugs, some engaged in diamond smuggling. The
                    infrastructure had deteriorated. Roads outside of Freetown were in horrible
                    shape. The university faculty had drifted away. Corruption in the bureaucracy
                    was rampant. Insurgents were active in a third of the country. The army was
                    ineffective and undisciplined. The place was in shambles.</p>
                <p>Here was a country that in the early 60's, when I was in INR, was picked as a
                    country with a bright future. I recall attending a meeting in the Department,
                    where we discussed what inputs from outside would be necessary to bring this
                    country to self-sustaining growth. We were serious about it. Yet it went
                    progressively down hill. It wasn't obvious while I was in Freetown that it was
                    going to reach the depths it has, but there was a great deal of tribal trouble
                    and corruption was growing. I can recall talking to the head of the army,
                    Brigadier Bangura, who was distressed that the army was being asked to send
                    troops to try to control poaching and smuggling in the diamond mining area. He
                    resisted, knowing that his poorly-paid troops would be paid big sums - more
                    often than they could earn in a year - if they would cooperate with the
                    poachers, often just agreeing to look the other way. He was sure that corruption
                    was going to penetrate the military. It did.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Sierra Leone because I had just completed four years in Ghana
                    and Washington was looking for someone with West African experience. The
                    Ambassador at the time was Bob Miner, a peach of a fellow, but with no African
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was he from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>DE PREE: His background was Yugoslavia, Turkey and Greece. He was a Roberts
                    College graduate. I think he knew Turkish and some Greek. During World War II he
                    had been in Yugoslavia, which was one of his areas of expertise. But because he
                    had been involved with Tito and the Partisans during World War II, McCarthy and
                    that crowd were suspicious of him and the Department didn't have the courage to
                    take them on. So the Department initially sent Bob Miner as ambassador to
                    Trinidad, then to Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>Bob Miner didn't have his heart in the assignment. His wife was ill. He was
                    disappointed that the Department hadn't gone to bat for him to get him the
                    assignment that he should have had. Bob Miner gave me pretty much a free hand to
                    meet whomever I wished in the government and to oversee the embassy's
                    reporting.</p>

                    Newsom was Assistant Secretary when I was in Sierra Leone. He was to visit
                    Guinea after his stop in Freetown and decided he would like to go by land. So we
                    drove up to the border where I put Dave into a dug-out canoe, and he was paddled
                    across the river. There wasn't much land contact between Guinea and Sierra
                    Leone. Sierra Leone, of course, was Anglophone while Guinea Francophone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any AID program in Sierra Leone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>DE PREE: We had an AID program and it gave us some problems. We were supporting
                    the agricultural college at Njala. The University of Illinois had a contract
                    with AID to provide faculty. There was a very high administrative cost factored
                    into the contract. The University of Illinois insisted on sending out people to
                    do administrative bookkeeping work which the Sierra Leoneans thought they were
                    qualified to do at far less cost. In fact they were, but the University of
                    Illinois felt otherwise. The Government of Sierra Leone was unhappy with the
                    contract and wanted to amend it to reduce the administrative costs and delayed
                    its renewal of the contract. With the end of the fiscal year approaching we were
                    in danger of losing funding for the project. Finally, the Minister of
                    Agriculture said that the government would sign, but “under duress.” I said,
                    “Nothing doing. This is an AID program and I am not going to report back to my
                    government that you are only willing to sign under duress. Either you want it or
                    you don't want it.” The Sierra Leone government signed. But in retrospect I
                    think we should have amended the contract as the Government of Sierra Leone had
                    wanted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The Peace Corps was strong. A very, very good Peace Corps
                    contingent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at this particular time, talking
                        about the second half of the '60s, of the Peace Corps? This is still the
                        high Peace Corps time. What was your impression of the influence and effect
                        of the Peace Corps in this particular part of Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I thought it was outstanding. They had a very large contingent. Probably
                    larger than they needed. They often had two people in the same village where one
                    might have been enough. But they were doing an outstanding job of getting to
                    know the people in the village. Many of them were teaching or in agricultural
                    development projects. They wanted to make a difference and were working hard at
                    it. They were living in the villages and the villagers appreciated this. Here
                    was somebody who cared, paying attention to their needs and their interests. The
                    Peace Corps made a very positive impression for the United States. And, of
                    course, in the end, the US benefited. We are beginning to get many of these
                    volunteers into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was doing recruiting I was skeptical at first about
                        the Peace Corps thinking they were just a bunch of do-gooders, but I was
                        very impressed by them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I guess one should ask if the Peace Corps made any lasting difference.
                    The Peace Corps itself has asked this question, returning to some of the
                    villages where volunteers had worked for ten or more years. They concluded that
                    the more lasting or more significant impact may have been on the Peace Corps
                    volunteers rather than on village development.</p>

                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No. Sierra Leone wasn't on Washington's screen for the most part. There
                    was the problem with the university contract. I think the cost of the contract
                    was excessive. The Peace Corps took care of themselves for the most part. There
                    was American investment in a rutile mine...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rutile is what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It is titanium oxide which is used in paint. It had some application in
                    space vehicles. An American-owned mine had its problems. It was a Rube Goldberg
                    type operation. The company's dredger, which was its key piece of equipment, was
                    constantly needing repairs and the company had to keep putting more money into
                    its investment. The company never showed a profit while I was in Sierra Leone.
                    There was also considerable American interest in Sierra Leone diamonds, but the
                    diamond companies could and did take care of themselves.</p>
                <p>Bob Miner, I thought, had the right perspective on Sierra Leone's importance to
                    the US On one occasion, when Siaka Stevens was going to the United States on a
                    private visit, at the invitation of one of the US diamond firms, he asked if he
                    might get in to see the President. Ambassador Miner drafted a cable, advising
                    the White House that it need not go out of its way to receive him. Fine if they
                    could do it, but it wasn't important to our interests. Maurice Tempelsman, who
                    bought diamonds in Sierra Leone and maintained a small office in Freetown,
                    however, thought it important that Stevens see the President and asked Herbert
                    Humphrey to help arrange a meeting. A meeting did take place, somewhat to the
                    chagrin of Bob Miner. It wasn't necessary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, to go to Senior Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because this is not just a history of our foreign
                        relations, I also try to get a feel of how the Foreign Service operated.
                        What was the senior seminar at that time and what did you get out of
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>DE PREE: There were about 25 of us in the Seminar, about half from State, and the
                    rest from other government agencies, one each from the military services. A
                    major focus of the Seminar then was on the domestic scene in the US, which was
                    certainly helpful to those of us who had been serving overseas. I believe the
                    National Defense Colleges focus much more on national security and military
                    issues. I couldn't have been more pleased. I traveled all over the United
                    States. I got to Alaska. We had some excellent lecturers. It was a great
                    year.</p>
                <p>But I'm not sure the Seminar is really cost-effective. This is particularly true
                    if officers in the Seminar retire a year or two after the year in the Seminar,
                    which I think had been the case shortly before I was assigned to the
                    Seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. I was in the one in 1975 and a couple of our
                        people retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we just shouldn't do that in the Department. You ought to take
                    people of a younger age who have ten years or so left, people who are earmarked
                    to hold responsible positions. Otherwise we shouldn't be investing that much
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes it was a little place of a parking spot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, I know that Personnel occasionally assigned officers they had
                    difficulty placing, rather than starting from what I gather is now the practice
                    of selecting officers in the Service who have a promising future. There weren't
                    many in my class like that, one or two.</p>
                <p>But it's a marvelous program. I am delighted it continues although it keeps being
                    mentioned for possible closure at budget time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there from 1970-71.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, and then I stayed on because I didn't have an assignment. Bert
                    Matthews, the coordinator, asked if I would be interested in staying on as his
                    deputy until my assignment came through. So I stayed on for about half a year,
                    essentially arranging the program. After the seminar I was assigned to the
                    Policy Planning Staff in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Policy Planning from 1972-76, almost four
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. I served under three directors. The first was Bill Cargo. He was
                    succeeded by Jimmy Sutherland, who stayed just briefly. Sutherland was replaced
                    by Winston Lord, who was given the job by Kissinger when Kissinger moved over
                    from the National Security Council to become Secretary of State. My
                    responsibility on the staff was to follow African developments. Because this
                    wasn't a busy portfolio, I also was asked to work on significant management
                    issues, which had the Secretary's attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a difference in how the Policy Planning Staff
                        was used before Kissinger came while Rogers was there and after, or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Day and night difference. The first two years that I was there the staff
                    spent a lot of time putting together a publication, which reviewed US foreign
                    policy for the year. Kissinger was over at the National Security Council and
                    wanted to be free to conduct policy. To keep the Policy Planning Staff busy, he
                    called for this annual policy review.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which, of course, is the complete antithesis of what you
                        are suppose to be doing. You are looking back instead of looking
                        forward.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. While there was some foreign policy projections, the publication
                    was primarily a review of the Administration's foreign policy initiatives of the
                    previous year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Kissinger became Secretary of State, what happened
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: When Win Lord came in as director, he asked about half the staff to
                    stay, the other half were asked to move on. Win and the Secretary had some of
                    their own people they wanted to place. And the staff's role changed
                    dramatically. Kissinger's style of operation was to confide in a few people.
                    Winston Lord was one of them. Because of that the Policy Planning Staff took on
                    many sensitive tasks, many of an operational nature, for Kissinger. And because
                    Win Lord had Kissinger's confidence, the Policy Planning staff was listened to.
                    The staff did a lot of the speech writing for Kissinger, which was a tough job.
                    His speeches went through many drafts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you worked on these speeches, was he trying to get the
                        perfect speech or was this part of his mental process of thinking something
                        through?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>DE PREE: I think both, a search for perfection as well as a thinking through of
                    an issue. His speeches were significant policy documents. A lot of time and
                    thought went into them. Not only into their content, but also into their timing.
                    He used speech making and public appearances to test the waters and move policy
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that has been said again and again is
                        that so often policy planning and anything doing with it...the Department of
                        State is almost completely reactive and very seldom is able to look ahead
                        whither Patagonia, or what have you. It sounds as though at least you were
                        having more of a handle on policy and looking ahead if you are talking about
                        helping with policy formulation rather than reacting to a situation at that
                        particular time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: There was much of that. Of course Kissinger brought to the Department
                    his own construct, his own global outlook. He knew what he was trying to
                    accomplish, and how to get there. I didn't have a problem with his priorities. A
                    top priority was to avoid a nuclear war or to avoid developments that could
                    provoke a conflict with the Soviet Union which would result in a nuclear war.
                    Ending the war in Vietnam was another of his priorities. Africa was low on the
                    scale of issues that demanded his attention or in which he was interested.</p>
                <p>One of the first major foreign policy issues with which I got involved was the
                    Azores base renegotiations. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, we had used the
                    Azores to resupply Israel. The Portuguese had permitted us to use the Azores
                    whereas a number of other countries, including many of our NATO allies, didn't
                    permit us to overfly or use their airports to resupply Israel. Shortly after the
                    war our Azores base agreement came up for renegotiation. The Portuguese were in
                    a strong negotiating position. We soon learned that the Portuguese wanted arms
                    for use in Africa, which would have meant a breach of our embargo against use of
                    US military equipment in Africa. The embargo had been in effect for a number of
                    years. But the Portuguese were determined. As a quid pro quo for use of the
                    Azores, they made it clear they wanted military equipment for use in Angola,
                    Mozambique and Guinea Bissau. Since this was an African policy issue, Win asked
                    me to work on it. I was told that the issue was sensitive and that the Secretary
                    did not think that the Assistant Secretary of African Affairs need at that stage
                    be privy to what the Portuguese were requesting. This surprised me because if
                    the US was going to breach the embargo there would be major consequences in
                    Africa. To keep the Assistant Secretary out of the negotiations I thought was a
                    mistake. While the Secretary or President Nixon might want to show their
                    appreciation to Portugal, the US should know what the consequences would be
                    before reaching a decision to breach the embargo. Nonetheless, at the initial
                    stage of the study, the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, who was Dave
                    Newsom at the time, was not brought into the picture. The European Bureau had
                    reservations, but wanted to be forthcoming with the Portuguese and favored
                    providing the Portuguese with arms, preferably defensive arms, for use in
                    Africa, if the Portuguese were adamant. When the Portuguese insisted, it became
                    clear that the African Bureau had to be brought into the picture. This was just
                    about the time Don Easum replaced Dave Newsom as Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>The African Bureau's position was predictable. Fine, if we feel we have to be
                    forthcoming with the Portuguese, why don't we simply give them money and let
                    them buy the arms on the world market, but let us not change our arms embargo
                    policy. But that is precisely what the Portuguese wanted us to do.</p>
                <p>I can recall one meeting that Kissinger chaired. Don Easum was there, Win Lord
                    was there. I think Wells Stabler may have represented EUR at the meeting. The
                    Secretary went around the room and asked for comments on a proposal to provide
                    arms. Don Easum was predictably negative. He noted that the embargo was a
                    long-established policy, that it has served us well, and that the reaction in
                    Africa, among some of our NATO allies, in Congress and with the US public, would
                    be strong. Why didn't we just look for a way to support Portugal without
                    breaching the embargo, if necessary give them money to buy the arms. When
                    Kissinger came to Win Lord he asked, “What does my conscience have to say?”
                    which I thought was high praise indeed. Win Lord took the view that we should
                    continue to explore ways to satisfy Portugal without changing our arms policy.
                    Most everyone took this view. You could tell that this didn't sit well with
                    Kissinger who I think was prepared to breach the embargo.</p>
                <p>He then surprised everyone by saying, “Well, does this mean that nobody wants to
                    carry out the wishes of President Nixon?” With Nixon and Kissinger wanting to
                    move forward, the Policy Planning staff was tasked to explore the various ways
                    we could supply arms to the Portuguese. Anton De Porte, who worked on Western
                    Europe on the Policy Planning Staff and I were asked to draft the options paper.
                    Kissinger hoped that the US could provide surplus or obsolete arms from “off the
                    shelf.” But the arms which the Portuguese wanted were not available. We
                    concluded that if we were to provide arms, we would have to go to Congress for
                    authorization and appropriation, and our judgement was that if you went to the
                    Hill, Kissinger or Nixon couldn't win this one. Nonetheless, Kissinger wanted to
                    take some readings with friendly senators. It was at this stage of our work that
                    a coup took place in Portugal, the government was toppled and we could
                    relax.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that I get from these interviews and
                        obviously from reading, was the problem of Kissinger not letting people know
                        what was going on. He would do things and not inform. I get this
                        particularly when he was National Security Advisor that he was often
                        undercutting our announced policy in order to make deals, particularly with
                        the Soviets. In this time did you see this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. Let me give you a good example. After I left the Policy Planning
                    Staff to be our ambassador to Mozambique — Kissinger was still Secretary of
                    State at that time — I received instructions from the Department to discontinue
                    sharing my cable reporting with my colleagues in southern Africa. I believe my
                    colleagues in the area received similar instructions. We were instructed to
                    report to Washington, and the Department would decided what other posts could be
                    sent the report. That was quite contrary to the way I had done things before.
                    Before, I had operated on the assumption that we should make sure we shared
                    information with posts that has an interest in the subject. But Kissinger's
                    style was to keep information very, very close, for fear that bringing more
                    people into the picture would hamper his freedom of movement. I think that was a
                    major failing.</p>
                <p>He often tried to keep the congress in the dark as well. His interest in
                    providing off-the-shelf arms to the Portuguese was prompted, I'm sure, by a
                    desire to avoid having to obtain Congress' OKAY</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, often the accusation, and I think very fairly
                        sometimes I think, is that one of the problems of the Foreign Service is
                        that it really doesn't understand domestic politics and that is where you
                        need politicians at the top to act as a buffer and all. But really the
                        Foreign Service should serve more with Congress as aides to understand it.
                        But in this case I take it it was pretty clear to those of you in the Policy
                        Planning, who were essentially professional Foreign Service officers, what
                        you could and couldn't do within Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, as we got further along on the Azores issue, we had to bring in the
                    Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs. Kempton Jenkins followed this
                    issue for H. Kemp's view was that arms for Portugal to use in Africa just won't
                    fly with the Congress and that if you tried to do it without consulting
                    Congress, it wouldn't work. Congress would eventually find out. However,
                    Kissinger seemed to be determined to find some way of getting arms to the
                    Portuguese. He may have been reflecting, as he said, President Nixon's wishes.
                    Those who argued against this were viewed as according too much importance to
                    African considerations.</p>
                <p>The second major African issue that I dealt with when I was on the Planning Staff
                    was Angola. This came up shortly after we had pulled out of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We pulled out of Vietnam in 1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. The Secretary's concern then was that the Soviets might read our
                    withdrawal as a weakening of our resolve around the globe, that the Soviets
                    would seize this as an opportunity to weaken our foreign policy posture
                    globally. Angola was thought to be one place where the Soviets might test our
                    will. Three groups were battling for power there: one was the MPLA, which had
                    its strength in Luanda. The MPLA was backed by the Soviet Union. A second group
                    headed by Holden Roberto, a Bakongo, was supported by Mobutu in Zaire. And the
                    third group, headed by Jonas Savimbi, had the tribal support of the Ovimbundu in
                    central and southern Angola. Those were the three forces. There were some in the
                    US Government who thought that in the aftermath of our withdrawal from Vietnam,
                    the Soviets might seek to test our resolve in Angola.</p>
                <p>We were providing some support to Holden Robert, but it was nominal. We may have
                    been providing some nominal help to Savimbi as well, but I'm not sure. While
                    Holden Roberto did not appear to be in a strong position, we began to receive
                    reports that he was scoring some successes in the field, suggesting, at least to
                    some in the US Government, that maybe with a little more help form the United
                    States, he could make things difficult for the MPLA and the Soviets. In this way
                    we would send a signal to the Soviets that they must not assume that because we
                    had withdrawal from Vietnam, we were weak and would be relaxing our guard or
                    activities elsewhere in the world, in this case in Africa.</p>
                <p>I don't know who took the initiative, the Department, the CIA, or perhaps the
                    Secretary himself. In any event, someone in the Administration proposed that the
                    US should step up its covert support for Holden Roberto. Incidentally, this was
                    before the first Cuban soldier arrived in Angola. The issue received high level
                    attention, with the Secretary himself chairing a meeting at the White House on
                    the subject. I attended this meeting for the Policy Planning Staff. It was
                    decided at this meeting that the US would increase its covert assistance for
                    Holden Roberto. It was thought that with this additional aid he would at least
                    be able to hold his own against the MPLA and maybe even begin to embarrass them.
                    It was clear to me from the discussion that the decision that was reached had
                    more to do with US-Soviet relations than it did with the various African issues
                    in the matter.</p>
                <p>I thought that the decision was a mistake, that by stepping up our aid to Holden
                    Roberto we would be fanning tribal divisions, that Holden Roberto, from what we
                    knew about him and his followers, was not an attractive force to bet on, and
                    that stepping up our aid, which would quickly become known, would likely prompt
                    the Soviets to step up their aid to the MPLA in reply. We were getting drawn
                    into something that we couldn't see the end of. And we didn't hold a strong
                    hand.</p>
                <p>When I got back to the office I told Win Lord that I was very unhappy with the
                    decision. I thought it was a serious mistake and suggested that another meeting
                    be held to weigh the negative consequences. Win said, “Go ahead and put your
                    concerns in a memo and I'll send it up to the Secretary if you make a good
                    case.” So I sat down and wrote a short two-page memo.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I showed the memo to Win and Sam Lewis, who was Win's deputy at the time, and
                    they agreed to send it to Kissinger. This took guts for I was challenging a
                    decision that had been made. I didn't hear anything for a couple of days. Then
                    Winston called me in and said, “Look, the Secretary didn't like that memo. He
                    really thinks that he should have somebody in S/P to help him on African issue
                    who is more supportive of what he is trying to accomplish than you seem to be.”
                    “But,” Win said, “You've done a good job in S/P and I will support you for an
                    ambassadorial appointment. I think the Secretary will agree to that.” So, I
                    considered what was coming up and told Win that I would like Mozambique. The
                    Secretary didn't object. But what a strange way to be nominated as ambassador
                    for Mozambique! It was essentially because I had misgivings about what we were
                    doing in Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The basic premise was that Henry Kissinger as he looked at
                        things globally saw that we looked kind of weak after leaving Vietnam in the
                        spring of 1975, and felt that Angola was a soft spot where the Soviets could
                        do something, so let us do this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I would put it just a little differently, Stu. The Soviets were already
                    in Angola. The government was pro-Soviet and the Soviets had a presence there
                    and were supporting the government of the day. We had provided nominal covert
                    support for Holden Roberto. When it appeared that there might be an opportunity
                    for us to embarrass the Government and the Soviets, we stepped up our
                    involvement which, I think, provoked the Cuban involvement and stepped up Soviet
                    support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little bit like poking a stick at a tiger and
                        getting him riled up. As we were looking at it at that time, was this part
                        of the great game between the Soviet Union and the United States? What was
                        our interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The interest was that they should not misread US resolve following our
                    departure of Vietnam. We wanted to make sure they didn't see our withdrawal as
                    an opportunity to expand their influence in other third would countries. Africa
                    was perceived to be a place the Soviets might want to test our will. We wanted
                    to show them that it wouldn't work or that it would be very costly. I didn't
                    have problems with Secretary Kissinger's policy priorities with respect to the
                    Soviet Union, nuclear war, or the Middle East. It was that he didn't consider
                    what was happening in Africa to be of much importance in and of itself; Its
                    importance was as an arena for contesting with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were getting into this just about the time we were
                        getting involved, not as much as maintained, but still involved, in
                        destabilizing Allende's government in Chile. There one has the feeling that
                        it was Nixon focusing on that and saying, “Well, we just can't have one of
                        these quasi-communist government's down there and can't we do something
                        about it.” Was this reflecting Nixon do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, that was there too. That was part of the picture. Of course, Ford
                    was President now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Ford.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He wanted to demonstrate that US foreign policy would have just as much
                    a backbone as before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also Kissinger was probably riding high. He had been in
                        the trade for a long time by this point and Ford was the new man on the
                        scene. In the normal course of events he would be heavily influenced by
                        anybody who was Secretary of State. But it is a funny way to look at this to
                        say, “Okay, here we have a guy who is saying things we don't want him to
                        say, so let's boot him out and make him an ambassador to basically the
                        sister country to Angola.” I would think they would be much better sending
                        him up to Mauritius, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: But he wasn't all that concerned about Africa until his last year in
                    office. At that time he was not really engaged on African issues, or when he
                    was, he still viewed our interests there as less important than our interests
                    elsewhere. For example, the breaching of the arms embargo in connection with the
                    Azores base negotiations, would have had dire consequences, in my judgment, in
                    Africa. And yet he was prepared to do it because he wasn't really that concerned
                    about what was taking place in Africa. Africa would be tended to later. That is
                    why he may not have been too concerned who was assigned to Mozambique.</p>
                <p>But in support of my candidacy, I had the backing of Win Lord and others because
                    in addition to working on African issues, which was not a full time job, I had
                    also been providing senior Department officers with staff support on general
                    management issues, budget issues. OMB was pressing the Department to try to do
                    more in linking resources to policy priorities. The Department sought to be
                    responsive. The Policy Planning Staff was a logical place to turn for policy
                    priorities. Since I was not fully occupied on African matters, I was asked to
                    work with the Under Secretary for Management and the budget people on this
                    matter.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I had worked earlier on various management projects for Larry Eagleburger, when
                    Larry was Under Secretary for Management. One of the projects was a review of
                    all State Department positions, the outcome of which was the elimination of some
                    400 to 500 positions if I recall. For the longest time the Department had far
                    more positions than we had people to fill them, so a lot of positions just went
                    vacant. Larry thought we should take a look at all our positions and eliminate
                    those of low priority so our people and positions were more in balance. I was
                    asked to chair this exercise. Every bureau told us that they would gladly give
                    up from 3 to 5 percent of their positions, so long as we let them get rid of the
                    people occupying those positions. Our big bureaus were carrying people nobody
                    else wanted, people who were on the rolls but weren't really delivering. It was
                    not a serious problem for Foreign Service positions, since Foreign Service
                    people rotate every two or three years, but in the Civil Service people remained
                    in their positions until they moved into another civil service position. Often
                    this didn't happen. If the Department could have found a way to remove the
                    deadwood from the roles, the bureaus would have been happy to give up 5 percent
                    of their positions and the Department would have operated more effectively. But
                    the Department couldn't make it happen.</p>
                <p>Larry greatly strengthened the M office during his period as Under Secretary. One
                    thing he did was to bring the Passport Office, which up to then had operated
                    more or less as an independent fiefdom under Francis Knight, back under his
                    control. Francis Knight had strong backing on the Hill because of the service
                    she provided Congressmen. Congressmen could wake her up in the middle of the
                    night to get a passport for a constituent. Because of her congressional backing
                    she could, and did, operate quite independently of Departmental supervision. I
                    think Eagleburger took the view that if Congress was to beholding to anyone, it
                    should clearly be to the Department of State, not to whoever might at the time
                    be head of the Passport Office. So, when Francis Knight left the scene, the
                    passport function was brought more directly under M's control.</p>
                <p>A second pocket of quasi-independent power at the time was the Bureau of
                    Administrative Affairs, then under the direction of Assistant Secretary for
                    Administration, John Thomas. John Thomas too worked closely with the Hill, in
                    this case on appropriation matters, and he had established exceedingly close
                    relations with key members of the Appropriation committees, especially with John
                    Rooney, long-time chairman of our appropriations subcommittee. Also, because
                    Under Secretary for Management often did not concern themselves with the nuts
                    and bolts of the budget, the A Bureau often had a major say on allocation of A
                    operating funds and positions. This was power. Larry realized this and was
                    determined to move the budget function out of the A Bureau under M. This gave M
                    more clout than it had before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For somebody reading this we are really talking about the
                        difference between M and A. A being really more of the housekeeping side,
                        but at the same time they were making decisions that would have tremendous
                        effects over policy. Whereas, Management stood one step higher and
                        technically they were looking at the overall and were very much involved in
                        policy considerations. Are we more interested in Latin America than we are
                        in Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: That's it. Win asked me to work, as a member of the Policy Planning
                    Staff, on this whole linkage between resources and policy priorities. Well,
                    where do you start. I don't want to fault John Thomas, he may have made the
                    right decisions, but he and his staff were making the decisions on the basis of
                    their understanding of policy priorities. The A bureau did hold hearings with
                    the assistant secretaries and the principals, and the budget reflected these
                    hearings, but a lot of key decisions were made which had a significant bearing
                    on policy matters that were made with little high level policy input.</p>
                <p>But how does one get a handle on it for a seventh floor principal who doesn't
                    have time to go through details of the budget, page after page? One way was to
                    make sure that the Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Assistant Secretaries were
                    brought more into the picture, and at an earlier stage. A second way was to make
                    sure the Under Secretary was presented with major budget options, spelled out in
                    policy terms. For example, with additional funding of 5 or 10 percent, what can
                    be accomplished in policy terms. More economic reporting officers? Opening of
                    new posts? More funding for refugees? etc. The Under Secretary for Management
                    must also decide if policy needs are so important that the Department should
                    appeal to OMB and the Congress for more money. Or can the Department live with
                    OMB's budget mark? What are the trade-offs between funding for equipment and
                    funding for people? Aggregating budget details into meaningful policy
                    alternatives is no easy task. But we made a start and I think with some success.
                    Dean Brown, who took over from Larry Eagleburger as Under Secretary, continued
                    to look to Policy Planning for help in according policy priorities more
                    importance in internal budget decisions and for developing a strategy, linked to
                    these priorities, in dealing with OMB and the Congress on budget matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you try to co-opt OMB and bring them into the process
                        early on, or did they sort of let you do your own thing and then go up to
                        OMB?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: At that time OMB had a very low opinion of the Department's budget, and
                    found much of our justification for additional funds or positions weak. So we
                    did turn to OMB for suggestions. And to some extent they were helpful. But the
                    linkage between resources and policy priorities was something we had to work out
                    pretty much on our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were dealing with this, did any of it get up to
                        Henry Kissinger, or did he feel that this was something that you all take
                        care of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Pretty much. He was concerned about budget issues, but his budget
                    problems were really outside the compass of the State Department's operating
                    budget. The operating budget was something that he left to Larry Eagleburger or
                    Dean Brown. His budget concerns were with funding for the larger international
                    affairs budget, or what we call the 150 account. Offers of foreign assistance
                    figured prominently in his foreign policy negotiations. OMB officials used to
                    complain that the Secretary would commit the US to provide foreign assistance in
                    the future (for example to Israel and Egypt) without assurances from Congress
                    that funds would be available in years to come. But the Secretary did not
                    concern himself with the State Department's operating budget so long as his
                    personal support needs were met. Of course, everybody in the Department always
                    takes care of the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of these positions weren't filled even though they
                        were on the books. Could you get rid of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we did remove those that hadn't been filled for a certain length of
                    time. There had been a lot of artificiality in position creation. The Department
                    would go to OMB and the Congress requesting that a position be established,
                    Congress would appropriate money to support that position and then the
                    Department would decide not to fill it and would use that money for another
                    purpose. Unfilled positions generated money that permitted the Department to
                    fund other activities. But in the long run this created problems for personnel,
                    for Foreign Service people often bid on these lower priority positions, which
                    the bureaus no longer had an interest in filling. Or if they were filled, they
                    probably should not have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in 1976 you were off to Mozambique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. I had thought that I would get out there when Mozambique became
                    independent in 1975, but the government of Mozambique just kept delaying action
                    on a request for agr�ment. They took about nine or ten months before responding.
                    Meanwhile I had to wait.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Were you policy planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, I was studying Portuguese. We had six kids by then and we packed off
                    two of the children to Sweden to be with their grandmother. My wife and the rest
                    of the children followed after a month. However, the agr�ment kept being
                    delayed. To permit me to be with the family over Christmas, Larry Eagleburger,
                    then Under Secretary for Management, had me carry out some special assignments
                    for him in East Germany and Moscow.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Eventually the agr�ment came through at the beginning of 1976, nine or ten months
                    after the original request. The Mozambicans were suspicious of the United
                    States. They were unhappy with our support of the Portuguese during their
                    liberation struggle, and they may have thought we were not to be trusted and
                    might work to destabilize the government.</p>
                <p>Before going out to Mozambique, there was a little episode that took place, Stu,
                    that I must relate. I had, as I mentioned earlier, worked on Jerry Ford's behalf
                    in the Fifth Congressional District of Western Michigan, and had stayed in touch
                    with Ford for a number of years. At one stage he even asked me if I was
                    interested in working on his staff, but I had said no. Although I had not been
                    in touch with him for a number of years, I thought I would like to call on him
                    before I went out. So I drafted a memo requesting such an appointment and sent
                    it down to AF for clearance and forwarding to the White House. Apparently that
                    raised a few chuckles in AF for I was told that the practice of ambassadors
                    calling on the president had ended decades ago. I knew that, but thought that
                    because of my past association with the President AF should have sent the memo.
                    At least, let the White House turn me down. Fortunately, I knew Harold Horan who
                    was a career officer working on the NSC staff and I called him and told him what
                    AF had said, and asked if he would find out if a meeting might be possible. Hal
                    agreed to see what he could do. He called back a few days later to say that the
                    President had agreed to see me. I didn't really know what kind of reception I
                    would get as it had been a few years since I had seen Ford. When I did have my
                    meeting with him, I told him about the Department's reluctance to request the
                    meeting. I also told him that I'd taken a few bets as to whether he would
                    recognize me. “You can tell your friends that you've won the bet,” he said. “I
                    do remember you,” adding that he had a very warm regard for Ottawa County, which
                    is the county I came from, which “gave me 70 to 72 percent of the vote for my
                    candidacy year after year.” We had a nice chat talking more about Western
                    Michigan, after which he asked me a few questions about Mozambique. So I did get
                    in to see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shall we stop here at this point? I think it might be best
                        to stop here and then we can continue next time with your going to
                        Mozambique and I would like to spend some time on that.</hi>
                </p>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Stu, you mentioned Graham Greene. During World War II, the British
                    stationed two intelligence officers in Africa, Graham Greene in Sierra Leone and
                    Malcolm Muggeridge in Lourenco Marques — two posts in which I have served. They
                    were there I guess to report on what the Germans or Italians were up to in their
                    respective areas. Freetown was important because it was a staging post for
                    allied convoys out of Africa; Mozambique because both the Germans and Italians
                    maintained a diplomatic presence in Lourenco Marques. Both have written about
                    their experiences. In my opinion, Graham Greene's, The Heart of the Matter, is
                    one of his best books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 9, 1994 and we are continuing with Bill De
                        Pree. We were getting you set to go to Mozambique where you served from
                        1976-80. Before going to Mozambique you had been dealing with the matters in
                        Africa anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: That is right, I was the Africa man on the Policy Planning Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So basically you didn't need to be brought up to speed
                        before you went. Did you have any problems with confirmation or anything
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No. The problem was the delay in getting agr�ment from the government of
                    Mozambique. We had to wait almost nine months. The Department hoped to get me
                    out there by independence day which was to be in the summer of 1975. We had put
                    in the request for agreement long before that, but the Mozambique Government
                    dallied. The Mozambicans were unhappy with our policy of support for Portugal
                    during their liberation wars; they were concerned that the United States might
                    not view with favor its Marxist pro-leftist radical government; and they had
                    some suspicion that the US might use the CIA to create problems. I think they
                    deliberately kept us waiting. We didn't get agr�ment until early in 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this also designed to make sure that the United States
                        would be fairly low on the totem pole as far as the diplomatic corps was
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, I think it was a signal to let us know that we were not the number
                    one player on the local scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Congress give you any problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Congress gave me no problems, but Congress had placed a ban on
                    development aid to Mozambique. There were three countries in Africa where
                    development assistance was proscribed: Ethiopia, Uganda and the government of
                    Mozambique. This was a very clear signal of how the Congress felt about
                    Mozambique. Nonetheless, the US decided to open an embassy since for the many,
                    many years we have professed to be in favor of self-determination. If we meant
                    what our rhetoric said, we should be prepared to enter into a relationship with
                    the government, even if it didn't meet with the favor of many in the US</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you got to Mozambique? The
                        capital of Mozambique is...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Maputo. It used to be Lourenco Marques when it was Portuguese.</p>
                <p>There had been some protocol problems right from the start. The US had a
                    consulate for many years in Lourenco Marques. At independence, the consulate
                    staff flew the flag over the consulate even though the US had not yet entered
                    into formal diplomatic relations with the Government of Mozambique. That made
                    the government of Mozambique unhappy and they asked the Consul General, Peter
                    Walter, to leave. The other Americans on the staff stayed on, as did most of the
                    local employees, although over the next year or two many of the white
                    Mozambicans on our staff left.</p>
                <p>Relations with the government were decidedly cool. It was very difficult to get
                    appointments with government officials. We had problems getting the government's
                    OKAY on housing and a new chancery. There were plenty of houses available, as
                    the Portuguese were departing, but the government denied our requests to rent or
                    buy the properties. Clearly, the government was letting us know we were not on
                    their list of favorites. We were not their “natural allies”, which was how the
                    government referred to the Soviets, Chinese and others who had supported them in
                    their liberation struggle.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The Mozambique Frelimo government was made up almost exclusively of
                    people who had been active in the liberation struggle. There were a dozen or so
                    ministers or key government officials who were committed communists. Some of
                    them didn't want the government to have anything to do with the US Moreover, the
                    Congressional proscription against providing development aid to Mozambique did
                    not make it any easier for us. It was certainly not an easy environment in which
                    to work.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>DE PREE: It was made up largely of people who had engaged in the liberation
                    struggle. The make-up was about 50 percent black, about 25 percent white and 25
                    percent mestizo. So racially it was a good mix. As a matter of fact, the
                    Portuguese territories probably did better on that score than a number of
                    British or French colonies. But the government was woefully inexperienced. The
                    same was true outside the government. For example, there were very few doctors.
                    I think there were two in the whole country when I arrived. So they were hurting
                    for people with skills. The Portuguese were leaving. At independence, there were
                    about 250,000, including military forces. A year later there were about 20 or 30
                    thousand. The departure of the Portuguese left the country desperate for people
                    who could assist in the development process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: There was an elected parliament, but there was only a single party slate
                    of candidates one could vote for. It was a Marxist government. But very few of
                    the people who came out of the liberation struggle were what one might call
                    dedicated Marxists. However, there was a radical minority of ideologues in the
                    government, many of them mestizos or white Mozambicans.</p>

                <p>DE PREE: Yes, it was. They were there in numbers and were providing military and
                    development assistance. Not only the Soviet Union, but China, Bulgaria, East
                    Germany, Cuba, the Vietnamese. There were communist advisors in every government

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He was a medical technician, one of the first to take up arms against
                    the Portuguese, who assumed the leadership of the liberation struggle upon the
                    assassination of Eduardo Moudlane, the founder of Frelimo. Machel was
                    charismatic, forceful, bright, something of a born leader.</p>

                        developments, or there to try to open up a dialogue. This was the beginning
                        of the Carter Administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Actually, I was sent out by the Ford Administration. In time, it was
                    hoped we could open up a dialogue, but initially it was pretty much a holding
                    operation. Judging by its votes in the UN, Mozambique was very much in the
                    Soviet camp. Its press and media were caustic and shrill in their criticism of
                    the US There wasn't much prospect of turning this around. There were many who
                    didn't even think it worth the try. They were prepared to write off Mozambique
                    from the start.</p>
                <p>There were others however, who thought that there might be some areas where US
                    and Mozambique interests overlapped and that the US should work to elicit
                    Mozambique's cooperation in these limited areas. One of the areas where we
                    thought that our interests might overlap was in seeking a negotiated settlement
                    in Rhodesia. This would be important to us, for if Mozambique worked against a
                    negotiated settlement it would be exceedingly difficult to halt the fighting,
                    for Mozambique bordered on Rhodesia and could provide sanctuary and support for
                    those intent on a military solution. It was also hoped that, in time, if the
                    Mozambicans could prosper as an independent nation that its non-racial or
                    multi-racial makeup might provide an alternative or model for the people of
                    South Africa.</p>
                <p>My approach was the later. To be patient, but to look for opportunities to
                    demonstrate to the Mozambicans that a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia was as
                    much in their interest as anyone else's. It was tough going, for the suspicion
                    and criticism of the West and the US was strong. But in time, the Mozambique
                    government came around to acknowledge that there were areas where the US
                    interest and Mozambique interest overlapped and we began to get their
                    cooperation in seeking a negotiated settlement in Rhodesia. Machel's cooperation
                    was very important. The British would not have achieved a settlement in Rhodesia
                    when it did without his help.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the sake of somebody who is not familiar with this,
                        could you go into the situation at that time in Rhodesia and what we were
                        trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. We were trying to work with the British to see if we could persuade
                    the white government in Rhodesia, led by Ian Smith, to hold elections and agree
                    that whoever won the elections would take over in an independent Rhodesia. There
                    were various groups in Rhodesia who had taken up arms, two major factions. One,
                    the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), had its headquarters in Maputo and
                    was led by Robert Mugabe. The second group, the Zimbabwe African People's Union
                    (ZAPU), was led by the long-time nationalist leader, Joshua Nkomo. They were
                    rivals for power. ZANU was largely supported by the Shona, the largest tribal
                    grouping in Rhodesia. ZAPU had its backing largely from the Ndelbele. Machel was
                    supporting ZANU. Interestingly, the Soviet Union was supporting ZAPU. The
                    British hoped to get ZANU and ZAPU and other political forces in Rhodesia,
                    including the whites, around the table to see if they could agree on a
                    cease-fire, a date for elections and a transition to independence. The
                    contenders were not able to settle it on the battlefield. Meanwhile the war was
                    spreading. Rhodesia began to carry out raids into Mozambique to go after the
                    ZANU rebels. There was a lot of fighting along the border. In time, the
                    Rhodesians began to stir up trouble inside Mozambique, creating a dissident
                    movement within Mozambique. It was very costly to Mozambique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where these white?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, these were black Mozambicans many of whom had fought with the
                    Portuguese military and had been suspect in the eyes of the Frelimo government.
                    They didn't really have a future in Mozambique. They were recruited, trained,
                    and armed by the Rhodesians to conduct insurgency within Mozambique. It didn't
                    amount to much in the first few years but gradually grew in importance. With the
                    dissidents receiving support from South Africa, the Frelimo government couldn't
                    suppress it.</p>
                <p>This was all going on while Mozambique's economy languished. Soviet and East
                    European assistance was not proving all that successful. The state farms and
                    communal villages were not producing the food that the government had thought
                    they would. Trade with South Africa, which had been a major foreign exchange
                    earner for Mozambique, was being cut. The two countries did continue to trade,
                    but there was a UN embargo on Rhodesian chrome which used to transit through
                    Mozambique, and the revenues of this transit trade all but dried up. The number
                    of Mozambicans working in the South African mines also dropped. Clearly, the
                    government was in trouble and realized that the economy was unlikely to pick up
                    without an end to the fighting in Rhodesia. At the same time, Mozambicans were
                    beginning to realize that state management of the economy was not the answer.
                    Nor was Soviet and Communist assistance.</p>
                <p>The humanitarian relief aid the US had been providing Mozambique, following
                    floods and drought in the country also helped to overcome the suspicion that the
                    United States may have wanted to topple the government. All these factors helped
                    persuade the government that it was in its interest to work with the British and
                    the United States to seek a negotiated settlement.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>By the second year of my tour in Mozambique, US relations with the government
                    began to improve. Machel began to explore with the British and us a way to end
                    the fighting in Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who would you talk to in the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Largely with President Machel himself. But the cooperation we got from
                    the Mozambicans on Rhodesian matters was largely done behind the scenes. Machel
                    did not want it known that he was working with us. He designated a couple of
                    people in his government Fernando Honwana and Sergio Viera, as embassy contacts
                    on these matters, but he was always available when I asked to see him. And he
                    would always see our joint negotiating teams whenever they came to
                    Mozambique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was with basically the Rhodesia/Zimbabwe thing,
                        was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, although we also brought him into negotiations on Namibia. I think
                    he appreciated that we sought his counsel and advice. With respect to Rhodesia,
                    he was suspicious that the British were seeking a settlement that would exclude
                    Mugabe and ZANU from power. I think he had reason to be suspicious. For a time,
                    the British did seem to favor a coalition of whites and moderates, including
                    Bishop Muzorewa, that would exclude Mugabe and ZANU. Machel thought this was a
                    mistake. He pointed out that Mugabe had the support of the Tshone, the largest
                    tribal group in Rhodesia, that ZANU was doing most of the fighting inside
                    Rhodesia, and that in the end ZANU and Mugabe would come out on top. Mugabe was
                    a difficult person to deal with. He refused to cooperate with the British and us
                    when he didn't like what we were doing, but he was just as quick to thumb his
                    nose at the Soviet Union and the East when he didn't like what they were doing.
                    He kept reminding us that it was Nkoma and Zapu, not he and ZANU, that the
                    Soviets were supporting. He was very much his own person. He had great
                    integrity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any contact with Mugabe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, I was seeing Mugabe. He would come over to the residence
                    occasionally with some of his people to discuss developments, or I would call on
                    him at his office. At first we and the British were reluctant or hesitant to
                    involve him in our efforts to reach a negotiated settlement. This may have been
                    because Ian Smith and the whites didn't trust him and thought they could put
                    together a majority coalition without his support. From the perspective of
                    Maputo this seemed to be a mistake and I urged the Department to consult with
                    him and include ZANU in the search for a negotiated settlement. At first the
                    Department didn't appreciate this. Through official, informed channels, I was
                    told that I might be pressing this point a little too hard. I was also hearing
                    through the grapevine that Secretary Kissinger was beginning to think that I,
                    and some of my Foreign Service colleagues in the area, might not be as
                    supportive of his and the British negotiating efforts as we should be. Clearly
                    Kissinger wanted to keep a tight reign on these negotiations. It was at about
                    this time that the Department instructed all the ambassadors in Southern Africa
                    that when reporting on the negotiations we should send our cables only to
                    Washington. The Department would decide what other posts in the area should
                    receive copies of our reports.</p>
                <p>I was miffed by what I was hearing. While no doubt some in Washington may have
                    thought I and my staff may have had the wool pulled over our eyes by Mugabe, we
                    were not doctoring our reporting. We were reporting things as we saw them. We
                    may have accorded more weight to what Mugabe said than the other Rhodesian
                    nationalists, but that was to be expected, given the fact that Mugabe's and
                    ZANU's headquarters were in Maputo. I thought that was why I was out there. So
                    we continued to report much as before. We didn't pull our punches. In time our
                    reporting did seem to register in Washington, particularly after the change of
                    Administration in January of 1977. Incidentally, one of the first cables we
                    received after Vance became Secretary of State, was one encouraging us to share
                    our reporting and views with neighboring posts. What a change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were people so set on Nkomo or Bishop Muzorewa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Because for a long time people thought Mugabe was not to be trusted.
                    They had the impression that either Mugabe or Bishop Muzorewa would be easier to
                    work with, would be more willing to accommodate the interests of the whites.
                    People were also put off by some of the firebrands within ZANU. Whatever the
                    reason, this notion that Mugabe and ZANU were not to be trusted persisted for a
                    long time. On the other hand, Machel and the Mozambicans did not fully trust
                    Nkomo or Muzorewa, fearing that they might be prepared to agree to a cease fire
                    before there was acceptance of the principal of majority rule. But, over time
                    Machel came to take the British at their word, that they would conduct free and
                    fair elections and turnover power to whomever won the election. From that point
                    we and the British had his cooperation in seeking a negotiated settlement.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The cooperation, however, almost came undone when the British failed to let him
                    know that they were urging President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia to meet privately
                    with Joshua Nkomo. When he heard that this meeting had taken place and that the
                    British and the US had known about it and hadn't told him about it, he was
                    livid. He called the British Ambassador and me in and told us that if we were
                    going to work behind his back with Nkomo, he would have to reconsider whether
                    Mozambique and the front line states should continue to work with us. He felt
                    terribly let down. I was instructed what to say, but the instructions were just
                    not convincing. I decided it was better just to acknowledge we did know about
                    the meeting, to regret that we had not consulted with him, and to live with the
                    consequences, rather than to try to justify our actions. In time, Machel
                    realized that he needed a settlement and that one couldn't be achieved without
                    the British or us, and resumed cooperating with us.</p>
                <p>Late in 1980, the British finally got everybody to agree to meet in London, at
                    Lancaster House...Mugabe, Nkomo, Sithole, Bishop Muzorewa and Ian Smith all were
                    there, as were representatives of the front line states, including Mozambique.
                    The British hoped that everyone at the conference would agree on the modalities
                    for a transition to majority rule and independence, and participate in
                    elections. But Mugabe was holding out. We and the British feared the conference
                    would break up without agreement. If so, it would be difficult to ever get them
                    together again. At that point I received a cable from President Carter
                    instructing me to request President Machel to use his influence with Mugabe to
                    get Mugabe to agree. There wasn't much time, for some of the delegations had
                    already purchased tickets to return home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were all up in London at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No, President Machel was in Maputo. I had about five or six hours in
                    which to try to persuade him to weigh in with Mugabe.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I had a good working relationship with Machel. The chemistry was right. We were
                    both candid and honest with each other. When I called for an appointment I was
                    told that he was in a cabinet meeting, but that he would see him immediately
                    afterwards and that they would call me just as soon as the meeting broke up.
                    When the call didn't come through, I asked if I could come over to the
                    President's office, where the cabinet was meeting so that I could see him as
                    soon as he got out? It wasn't long after I got there that the meeting broke up.
                    Machel and I went into a corner. I delivered President Carter's request as
                    instructed, emphasizing that the US would work with the British to ensure free
                    and fair elections. This is what the Zimbabweans and front line states had been
                    fighting for. They had won. I told him that we believed he was the one person
                    who could persuade Mugabe to agree. Would he do it? He looked me in the eye and
                    said, “Yes, I will do it. Tell President Carter that I will try me best.” I
                    rushed back to send a cable. And then we waited. It wasn't long and we were
                    informed that agreement had been reached. The British, who were monitoring
                    telephone calls, later told us that Machel called Robert Mugabe. Machel told him
                    that he had this appeal from President Carter, that we had assured him that
                    there would be free and fair elections and that power would be turned over to
                    whomever won the election. If Mugabe felt he had the support of the majority of
                    Zimbabweans as he said he had, and Machel thought he had, then they were going
                    to win the election and that would be the end of it. He urged Mugabe to sign. I
                    got a nice cable from Washington thanking me for my efforts with Machel.
                    Margaret Thatcher has since publicly acknowledged that it was Samora Machel's
                    intervention that brought about the settlement.</p>
                <p>Our decision back in 1976 to enter into diplomatic relations with Mozambique and
                    to seek Mozambique's cooperation in those areas where US and Mozambique
                    interests overlapped paid off.</p>

                        and that is often the idea is raised, “Why do you need an ambassador, the
                        Secretary of State can pick up the phone and call somebody?” But it is true
                        in business, it is true in personal relations and is true in foreign
                        relations that the person on the spot if they can develop a relationship, it
                        doesn't have to be a warm friendly relationship, but one of understanding
                        and basic trust, that you can communicate through this. You can't do it with
                        the great man back in Washington picking up the phone and saying to do this
                        and do that. It just doesn't work.</hi>

                <p>DE PREE: No, it wouldn't have worked that way. During Kissinger's last year as
                    Secretary of State he was very much engaged in African issues. He came out to
                    Africa. He wanted to come to Mozambique. I was instructed to see which of two
                    possible dates would be most convenient for President Machel. Machel saw me at
                    once, but said he would have to think it over and would let me know the next
                    day. I knew the answer was likely to be no. And it was. It was, I was told, “an
                    inopportune time for the Secretary to visit Mozambique.” This wasn't the easiest
                    cable to send. With the Secretary being courted by almost everyone to visit
                    their capitals, what kind of ambassador did the US have in Maputo, who couldn't
                    even persuade the head of state to receive the Secretary. I could almost hear
                    the Secretary's comments in Maputo. So Secretary Kissinger never visited
                    Maputo.</p>
                <p>A couple of years later, after Carter had won the election, Machel went to the UN
                    and met with President Carter in New York. I attended the meeting. In the course
                    of the discussion, Machel mentioned that he had turned down Secretary
                    Kissinger's offer to visit Maputo. He said he wanted President Carter to know
                    why. It was because “I didn't trust Secretary Kissinger then and I don't trust
                    him now.” With that attitude no ambassador could have persuaded Machel to
                    receive Kissinger.</p>
                <p>Machel had a great respect for President Carter. He believed President Carter's
                    veto of Congressional action to rescind the embargo on Rhodesian chrome was
                    crucial to the settlement. The veto persuaded Machel and Mugabe that President
                    Carter and the US could be trusted. I can remember receiving the news of
                    President Carter's veto. I had to go to the airport early in that morning
                    because Machel was leaving on a trip, and it was customary for the diplomatic
                    corps to see him off. Robert Mugabe was out there, as he was accorded diplomatic
                    status by the Mozambicans. I took the occasion to break the news of President
                    Carter's veto to him. He was very moved, embraced me, and said, “Now there is a
                    chance to end the fighting.”</p>
                <p>I informed President Machel too of the veto, but did not have a chance to discuss
                    it at any length because of his departure. He was off to some conference. He may
                    even have been going to Cuba. Shortly after his return, he opened a new session
                    of parliament. Afterwards, as was the practice in Maputo, members of the
                    parliament, the cabinet, the diplomatic corps and party officials assembled in a
                    circle to greet the President. He began to shake the hands of people around that
                    circle. When he came to the diplomatic corps he spotted me, took my hand and
                    walked me diagonally across the circle of all these people. We retreated to a
                    corner, where he asked me to send a message to President Carter, thanking him
                    for his courageous act of vetoing the legislation. Then he walked me back arm in
                    arm across that circle and got into his car. My diplomatic colleagues, the
                    Cubans, the Russians, the Chinese must have wondered what this tete-a-tete was
                    all about, for publicly Machel and the Mozambicans were still rather critical of
                    the US, nor did they know how much cooperation we and the British were receiving
                    from Machel behind the scenes. This was a moment in my diplomatic career that I
                    savor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Machel was almost atypical of many of leaders
                        that he wasn't out to get political points but out to get something
                        done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, I think he was genuinely interested in doing something for the
                    people of his country. There was very little corruption in the government during
                    the time I was there. It did not take Machel long to realize that state
                    management of the economy was not the answer to Mozambique's problems. Nor was
                    Mozambique's close relationship with the Soviets much help. In my third year in
                    Maputo I got a call asking if I could come see him. He wanted to talk to me
                    about agricultural production in the United States. Jimmy Kolker, who was a
                    junior officer at the time, came along as a notetaker. Three or four cabinet
                    ministers were with the President. He began by saying, “Look, you Americans know
                    how to produce food. You are the world's major producer of food. And you know we
                    are having problems with our production. The Bulgarians who are helping us with
                    rice haven't had much luck. In fact their aid project is a disaster. Why don't
                    you come in and prove your way is better. You and the East can compete here in
                    Mozambique. We will let you have as much land as you need, good land. We will
                    even let you have land in the Incomati basin, which is fertile and well watered.
                    My minister of agriculture,” who was at the meeting, “will see that the land
                    will be made available at once.”</p>
                <p>It was the type of offer one would have liked to have accepted, but I told him
                    there were two reasons why we just couldn't do it. I reminded him that there was
                    still a Congressional proscription on development aid to Mozambique, which
                    prohibited the Administration from providing any development assistance to
                    Mozambique. I said that I hoped that proscription would soon be lifted [it was
                    later]. But I said the second reason was even more important and that was
                    because our approach to agricultural production was quite different from the
                    approach adopted by the government of Mozambique. I said the US government did
                    not try to manage the economy. We left that to the private sector, where the
                    price of commodities and market forces encouraged the individual to produce, to
                    make it worth his while to produce. I said that in my view Mozambique would have
                    to change its whole approach to agriculture and the economy before Mozambique
                    was going to have much success in turning its economy around. I would have loved
                    to been able to proven that we could have done it better, but that just wasn't
                    in the cards.</p>

                        Nyerere had gone the socialist route and basically destroyed the economy?
                        Was he looking around and seeing how these things didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He had his eyes open. He was bright and quite aware of the problems his
                    friend Julius Nyerere had in Tanzania. He saw too what neighboring South Africa
                    had accomplished with its approach to agriculture. He was a pragmatist. I am
                    convinced that had he not been killed in the plane crash, you would have seen
                    quite a change in Mozambique's approach to management of their economy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you put yourself in a position deliberately in
                        competition with the Soviets by saying that you are doing it this way and it
                        isn't working? Or did you not over emphasize the competitive aspects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We didn't really have to. The Mozambicans had their eyes open and were
                    quite aware of what was going on. The Soviets and the East had a big presence in
                    Mozambique. The government wasn't getting as much out of their aid effort as
                    they thought they should. For example, the Soviets were harvesting shrimp off
                    the coast and shared their yield with Mozambique. But the Mozambicans believed
                    they were being short changed. Moreover, the Mozambicans were being told that
                    the Russians were applying fishing methods which were destroying the beds and
                    endangering the future of the industry. Machel was aware of this. It wasn't
                    necessary for us to keep reminding him. The communists' failures spoke for
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Machel was very much a realist, not only on economic issues, but other matters as
                    well, including South Africa. In 1977, Andy Young, then our Ambassador to the
                    UN, came to Maputo to attend a UN conference, which had been called to show
                    solidarity with the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia. On that occasion Andy Young
                    met with President Machel. I accompanied Andy. They talked about the racial
                    situation in South Africa. Andy Young drew on the experience of the Civil Rights
                    movement in the United States to suggest that some of the lessons learned might
                    be helpful in South Africa. Machel listened politely but kept reminding Andy
                    Young that the numbers were different. Whereas in the US the percentage of
                    blacks in the United States was about 15-20 percent, in South Africa it was the
                    reverse. Machel thought the fundamental difference in numbers argued for a
                    different approach. But he said that the whites had every right to be in South
                    Africa. In fact they had as much right as the blacks since much of southern
                    Africa was open country when the Bantus and Afrikaners moved in. Yet while the
                    whites had every right to be there, they didn't have the right to suppress the
                    blacks. That had to cease. I think over time Machel would have been helpful in
                    bringing about a peaceful transition in South Africa.</p>

                        wars going on. One inside of Mozambique and one in Rhodesia. This seems like
                        a place where you might say the CIA couldn't help but get involved. Was this
                        a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, it was. Mozambique was obviously a country in which the CIA wanted
                    to be present. There was a large Chinese and Soviet military and diplomatic
                    presence. The Cubans, East Germans, and Vietnamese were also there. We did have
                    CIA personnel in the embassy. They were not declared. For the first few years,
                    it was a rather unproductive station. This bothered headquarters officials in
                    Washington, who thought they should be getting more out of the station than the
                    station was able to deliver. Washington was putting a lot of pressure on the
                    station to get moving. Because of that pressure the station became more lax in
                    terms of the safeguards and professional standards that they applied. I was
                    concerned because of the risk of being caught out.</p>
                <p>I got myself into trouble with the agency when I turned down requests of senior
                    CIA officials to visit Maputo. Even though the Government of Mozambique and the
                    Soviets, Chinese and others were well aware there were Agency people on the
                    mission staff, I did think it wise to call attention to this fact. I therefore
                    turned down some very senior people. I was told later that they didn't
                    particularly like it. But I was concerned that headquarters didn't appreciate
                    the risk they were running of operating in Mozambique.</p>
                <p>I left the country in the Fall of 1980. Shortly thereafter one of the station
                    officers sought to recruit somebody in Maputo and got caught red-handed. As a
                    result the entire station was kicked out. In my judgment this happened because
                    we were amateurish, we were too impatient for results and took unacceptable
                    risks. We were very critical of the government of Mozambique for expelling our
                    people and asked for an apology. I thought we protested too much. After all, we
                    had brought it on ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is always a problem because these operations have a
                        life of their own. You have to produce...what we are really talking about is
                        the recruitment of agents who will then send in reports and this is always a
                        very tricky thing because if this effort gets publicized...we have a major
                        case right now in the United States called the Ames Spy case, which has
                        upset relations with Russia. These things not only have a life of their own,
                        but have major political consequences, often far out weighing any results

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: It was a long time before we assigned an ambassador to Mozambique
                    because we didn't like the way they handled this incident. We didn't like being
                    publicly exposed the way we were. Let me add here that the US government was not
                    seeking in any way to topple or create problems for the government of
                    Mozambique. We were interested in knowing what the Soviets, the Cubans and the
                    other Communist players in Mozambique were up to. In my judgment, that was a
                    legitimate objective. But we did it in such a way that we created problems for
                    our bilateral relationship. This took time to heal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Well you couldn't help but run into these people. Whenever the
                    diplomatic corps assembled formally, the Mozambicans asked us to line up in
                    order of our presentation of credentials. This put me next to the Cuban
                    Ambassador, with whom of course we didn't have relations. I was civil. He was
                    too. We would engage in small talk, but not much more. That was true of other
                    communist diplomats with whom the US did not have diplomatic relations; except
                    for the North Koreans. The North Korean Ambassador refused to shake hands with
                    me. He would just put his hand behind his back as Dulles did with Zhou
                    En-lai.</p>
                <p>Mozambique was a fascinating place to be. I stayed almost five years. I was
                    scheduled to leave after three years but stayed on because of the good working
                    relationship I had established with Machel and because of the on-going
                    negotiations on Rhodesia and Namibia. I left a few months after the elections in
                    Zimbabwe. It was a very satisfying tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left there in 1980 and came back to do
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I was assigned to the Inspection Corps, which I thought might be a
                    holding operation until something else developed, but no sooner had I arrived in
                    Washington than they pulled me out of the Inspection Corps to work on a special
                    project for Secretary Muskie. President Carter had asked Secretary of State
                    Muskie to take a look at the budget requests of USAID, USIA, the Peace Corps,
                    the Export-Import Bank, all the agencies funded out of what we call the 150
                    account, the international affairs funding account, to make sure that the
                    allocation of resources was consistent with the policy priorities set by the
                    Secretary of State. A small team was assembled under Ambassador Dean Brown to do
                    this for Secretary Muskie. Deputy Secretary Christopher took a great interest in
                    the project.</p>
                <p>Despite the protests of some of the agencies, the team recommended some
                    adjustments in the budget submissions of these agencies. In a few cases, funding
                    for activities with a low policy priority were recommended be dropped. Agency
                    heads were unhappy to have any outsider taking a close look at their budget
                    requests after they had signed off on them. But Secretary Muskie accepted most
                    of our teams recommendations. OMB, which had an officer participate in the
                    review, was pleased with the review and the team's and Secretary's efforts to
                    link funding in the 150 account more closely to policy priorities. But then the
                    election came and President Carter's budget was replaced by the Reagan budget,
                    so the exercise didn't bear fruit. But as an effort it was significant, and I
                    understand Secretary Christopher is once again seeking to link resources in the
                    150 account more closely to policy priorities.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>That assignment lasted about five months. Then I returned to Inspection Corps and
                    had a year there. I headed some interesting inspections, London, Dublin, and our
                    missions to NATO and the European Community. After a year of inspection work I
                    was assigned as Executive Assistant to the Under Secretary for Management, who
                    at that time was Dick Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we first hit on the inspection side a bit. How were
                        inspections conducted at that time from your perspective and how effective
                        were they? What was the status of inspections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I was disappointed. In my opinion, our approach was too formalistic. It
                    was essentially a report card on how the various operating units in an embassy
                    were doing. There was a sameness to all the reports. Very few people read them.
                    We sent them off to Congress where they were filed and that was it. The value
                    came largely in the preparations made by the missions for the inspection. The
                    mission would be told what we were going to look for and obviously would
                    hurriedly take steps to get ready for us. That was useful. Oh, occasionally you
                    would find something of significance that would enter into the report. But there
                    was very little policy focus in the report. I thought that inspectors should
                    focus far more on the policy. What was it? Did everyone at the post know what we
                    were trying to accomplish? Did the staff participate in policy review? Were the
                    post's resources appropriate to our policy objectives? We tried to do this in
                    our inspection of the London embassy, with some success. Today's inspection
                    reports are much better, thanks in large part to Sherman Funk, the current
                    Inspector General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in the Inspection Corps for about one
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: About one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings it to about 1982?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Early 1982, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Then I was invited to become Executive Assistant to Under Secretary for
                    Management, Dick Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about Dick Kennedy, because he had a
                        reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, I was aware of the reputation. People warned me about working for
                    Dick Kennedy, that he had a temper and had difficulty at times controlling it.
                    But I was interested in management issues. I had worked, as I said earlier,
                    worked on management issues while on the Policy Planning Staff. And, quite
                    frankly I wasn't interested in staying any longer with the Inspection Corps. So
                    I took the job.</p>
                <p>Dick Kennedy did prove as difficult as people had said he was. He had many
                    strengths, understood the Department quite well, kept on top of what was going
                    on, and was very effective, I thought, in his budget appearances before our
                    appropriations subcommittees. But he was often his own worst enemy when working
                    with people. If things didn't go quite the way Dick Kennedy wanted them to go,
                    he would from time to time rant and rave and scold people in front of other
                    people, including very senior people in the Department. Obviously people don't
                    like that. After I had worked for him about a year, Shultz came in to replace
                    Haig as Secretary. Haig and Kennedy had a very close relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain Kennedy's background before he came
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He was a former military officer. He had worked closely with Al Haig at
                    the National Security Council and had a good relationship with the Secretary.
                    Because of that relationship Kennedy's influence within the Department as Under
                    Secretary during Haig's tenure as Secretary was considerable. During all that
                    time, Dick Kennedy wore two hats. He was Under Secretary for Management and
                    Ambassador-At-Large for nuclear matters. These were two active portfolios. He
                    worked hard and had a quality staff on both sides. But at times the work got too
                    much for him, I think, and he had difficulty...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As his Executive Assistant, could you ever sit him down
                        and say, “Now, cool down, stop this, you are not being effective?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, there were times when I would be embarrassed at meetings where he
                    would take out after an individual and chew the officer out in front of others,
                    and I would tell him that I didn't think it was helpful to him to do that. If he
                    didn't like what someone was doing, I urged him to call the person in, shut the
                    door and discuss the matter face to face, but not to berate the person in front
                    of other people. But it didn't work. He just couldn't seem to control his
                    temper.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>When Shultz came in as Secretary of State, he called Dick Kennedy in and told him
                    he thought it was too much for Kennedy to wear two hats and asked Kennedy which
                    of the two jobs he would like to keep. Kennedy told me that he wanted to stay on
                    as Under Secretary for Management. But meanwhile, people who Kennedy had
                    offended, including some assistant secretaries and very senior officers got to
                    Shultz and said, “Look, we're having trouble working with Dick Kennedy as Under
                    Secretary and suggest you look for someone else to fill that position.” When
                    Kennedy went back and told Shultz that he wanted to remain as Under Secretary
                    for Management Shultz told him that he was too valuable as Ambassador for
                    Nuclear matters and that he was going to find somebody else to look after
                    management. I think it was largely because of Dick Kennedy's style of
                    operation....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...was notorious and I was far removed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yet his understanding of the job and the preparation for Congressional
                    hearings, I thought was very good. But you don't succeed in that job unless you
                    can work with people. And over time people just turned against him, worked
                    around him or would avoid him at all costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were working with Kennedy, what were some of the
                        management issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Maybe, if I could jump ahead Stu, because I worked for three Under
                    Secretaries and sometimes I get mixed up. After Kennedy left, George Shultz
                    brought in a friend of his, Jerry Van Gorkom, a businessman, a CEO, from the
                    Chicago area. Van Gorkom had no prior government experience. He was a quick
                    learner but just found that he had too much to learn about the bureaucracy and
                    the State Department. He also had a different management style. He thought as
                    Under Secretary for Management he should have authority to make the basic
                    management decisions and that he would have the backing of the Secretary and
                    Deputy Secretary on these matters. This was his undoing. The issue that
                    triggered his departure was the allocation of space in the Department. Van
                    Gorkom looked at the situation and concluded there wasn't enough space for
                    everybody, somebody would have to move out. He thought since the State
                    Department had moved some of its people out of the building, AID should likewise
                    be asked to relocate some of its operations. He thought that as Under Secretary
                    this was a decision that should have been left to him to decide. But Ken Dam,
                    who was Deputy Secretary at the time, over-ruled him. If he was not going to be
                    backed on what Van Gorkom thought was a fair and well-reasoned management
                    decision, he would have to quit. Although Van Gorkom by that time was beginning
                    to grow into the job and would have liked to stay on, it was too late.</p>
                <p>Van Gorkom was followed by Ron Spiers. Ron, of course, was a product of the
                    institution and knew the Department inside and out. I was Director of Management
                    Operations and Ron's deputy until I left to go overseas in 1987. So I worked for
                    three Under Secretaries.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>I dealt with a good many management issues in my almost six years in M and M/MO .
                    Probably the most troublesome was security. It was certainly the most urgent.
                    While I was not directly responsible for security — that was the responsibility
                    of the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security — as Executive Assistant to
                    the Under Secretary and later as Director of management Operations I
                    participated in numerous meetings on security. The bombing of our embassy in
                    Beirut occurred when Van Gorkom was Under Secretary and he and I accompanied
                    then Under Secretary Eagleburger to Beirut to escort the bodies back to
                    Washington. That bombing was followed closely by the bombing of the marine
                    barracks. These bombings shook Secretary Shultz who decided it could no longer
                    be business as usual — it was necessary to make Departmental personnel more
                    conscious of the importance of security. The Department commissioned Admiral
                    Bobby Inman to review the state of diplomatic security and to recommend measures
                    to improve it. Inman recommended significant upgrading of security, including
                    the hardening of embassies, additional security personnel and a lot of
                    consciousness training for staff and dependents. The upgrade carried a steep
                    price tag.</p>
                <p>While Congress was sympathetic and appropriated millions more for security,
                    budget considerations were always an issue. We in M were afraid that Congress
                    might reduce funding for day-to-day Departmental operations in order to offset
                    the additional money being appropriated on security. This did happen. But where
                    should one draw the line? What was an acceptable risk? I can remember one
                    discussion that came up over the proposed construction of a new embassy in
                    Guinea-Bissau. With Secretary Shultz taking the position that today's low threat
                    post might be tomorrow's high threat post, the security people proposed that the
                    new embassy incorporate all the Inman Standards for a high threat post. But this
                    brought the estimated cost of the embassy to more than $30 million, which
                    someone pointed out was more than half the country's GNP. It simply didn't make
                    sense to spend this much money on a new embassy in Guinea-Bissau. Something had
                    to give. In the end, it was decided that the new building would not have to meet
                    all the Inman specifications. But common sense didn't always prevail. and I'm of
                    the opinion that a lot of money — hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on
                    security, which in retrospect should have been better spent on something else,
                    or not spent at all.</p>
                <p>A second major management issue was staffing overseas. If the cost of protecting
                    our personnel overseas was so costly, did we really have to have all these
                    people overseas? As director of Management Operations I was asked by Secretary
                    Shultz to undertake this review. We looked at not only State's staffing but
                    AID's, CIA's, and the other agencies as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The military too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Defense attach�s, yes. Any US personnel that came under the authority of
                    the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The corridor folk tale in the Foreign Service is every
                        time we go under one of these exercises, the State Department gives up
                        people, but none of the other organizations do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: We started by asking the ambassador what size staff they thought they
                    needed to effectively promote and pursue US interests in their country. Most
                    were quite frank in their reports. As you might expect, a number of ambassadors
                    thought that AID was larger than it should be, or that the station or Defense
                    Attach� offices were larger than necessary. But reductions in State staffing
                    were also recommended. We invited the agencies to comment on the ambassadors
                    cables. The agencies and bureaus were not as forthcoming. This was to be
                    expected I guess. We also talked to the agencies and bureaus about relocating
                    some overseas operations, bringing their regional personnel back to Washington,
                    moving our bookkeeping and financial management systems out of Mexico City to
                    Miami, for example. When we completed our review we recommended cuts of
                    somewhere between 700 to 800 if I remember correctly.</p>
                <p>At that point, President Reagan chaired a meeting of agency representatives. It
                    was agreed that some cuts would have to be made, but in the end the cuts fell
                    far short of what we recommended. However, if nothing else, the review did slow
                    growth of overseas staffing. The agencies were reluctant to ask for more
                    overseas positions. When they wanted to increase at one post, they now agreed to
                    reprogram positions from some other post which kept overall overseas staffing
                    the same. At least this constraint operated for a year or so immediately
                    following the review.</p>
                <p>Closely associated with that review was a post closing exercise. This was
                    undertaken when Ron Spiers was Under Secretary. Pressure for post closing arose
                    when OMB and the Congress began to take bigger cuts in State's requests for
                    operating funds. Rather than ask each bureau and post to take a 5 or 10 percent
                    across the board cut, Ron Spiers decided we should be more selective and close
                    some of our low priority posts. So we decided we would look, starting with
                    consulates. We asked the Regional Bureaus to rank order their consulates from
                    the most important to the least important. We asked the Consular Affairs Bureau
                    which were the most important with respect to consular operations. Then we went
                    to the Agencies to get their opinions. We put all this information on spread
                    sheets, with the highest ranking consulates at the top and the lowest ranking on
                    the bottom. A number of posts were ranked low by everybody. There were about 20
                    posts that were on everybody's bottom of the list. We identified these for
                    possible post closings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turino was always one.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, Turino was on the list. When the list surfaced Congress got
                    involved. Somebody from Minnesota was upset that Goteborg was on the list.
                    Senator Glenn for some reason didn't want to close Brisbane. Nice had it
                    supporters. As a matter of fact, the American community in Nice actually paid
                    the expenses of a three person delegation to come to Washington and pay a call
                    on Secretary Shultz. They asked how much it cost to operate the consulate. They
                    offered to contribute money so that we could keep Nice open. Incidentally, we
                    kept Nice on the list, but Congress made it clear they were going to insist we
                    keep it open, so we couldn't close...I think we ended up with 12 closures.</p>
                <p>That was the type of thing that we in the management side of the house were
                    doing. We also got involved in the polygraph issue. Remember, this was the
                    period...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the so-called lie detector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The Reagan White House had insisted that people in certain agencies
                    should be subjected to the polygraph as condition of employment. It is common
                    practice in CIA, but not in the Department. Secretary Shultz had strong views
                    against ordering polygraphs in the Department. He did not think it was a
                    reliable instrument. People can beat the polygraph. That has been demonstrated
                    in the Agency with the Ames case. Besides, it creates a false sense of security.
                    So Shultz dug in. As Director of Management Operations, I had to go up on the
                    Hill several times to testify on behalf of the Department.</p>
                <p>Although the Reagan White House had ordered that the polygraph be applied widely,
                    Shultz was determined that it wouldn't be done as a matter of course or as a
                    condition of employment in the Department. He would not require any individual
                    to take the test if the individual chose not to do so. The Secretary would not
                    give any more ground on this issue. He even threatened to resign if he were
                    overruled. The White House backed down. They needed George Shultz more than they
                    needed the polygraphing. He was really determined on this one, and I think
                    rightly so.</p>
                <p>In M/MO I also got involved in a lot of personnel issues. These would come up in
                    the Management Council, which Ron Spiers had set up as an advisory body on a
                    wide range of management issues. In addition to the Director of Management
                    Operations, the Director General of the Foreign Service, the Comptroller, the
                    Assistant Secretary for Administration, the Assistant Secretary for Consular
                    Affairs, the Inspector General, the Director of the Foreign Service Institute
                    and Ron's Executive Assistant participated in the Management Council. Ron was a
                    marvelous Under Secretary. Everybody was encouraged to speak their mind. There
                    was real give and take.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>One of the most difficult personnel issues the Council considered was over the
                    size of the Senior Foreign Service. The Department was under considerable
                    pressure from the Congress and OMB to reduce the size of the senior Foreign
                    Service. OMB even threatened to reduce funding for operations if we didn't do
                    so. We tried hard and had some success. One way we did this was to reduce the
                    number of limited career extensions we offered senior officers, who has served
                    the maximum time in grade and would have to leave the service unless invited to
                    stay on. More controversial, was the decision to reduce dramatically promotion
                    into the senior foreign service, which caught unawares a lot of 01-officers, who
                    had opened their promotion window, which gave them six or seven years to be
                    promoted or be compelled to leave the Service. By reducing the promotion rate
                    into the senior Foreign Service, we of course reduced an officers chances of
                    ever making it across the senior threshold. The Department lost a good many fine
                    officers as a result. I thought, when we changed the rate of promotion, that we
                    should have given those officers who had opened their window more time to make
                    it across the threshold, but I was in a minority.</p>
                <p>The Office of Management Operations also got very much involved on budget issues,
                    although it was the Comptroller, Roger Feldman, and his budget people who had
                    primary responsibility for putting the budget together. M/MO provided staff
                    support for the Policy Priorities Group (PPG), which had been set up by Larry
                    Eagleburger when he had been Under Secretary for Management. The PPG brought
                    together the Department's senior policy and budget managers to make certain the
                    Department's budget adequately funded foreign policy and management priorities.
                    We in M/MO tried to focus the discussion on the key issues and meaningful
                    policy-related options or trade-offs. Could the Department accept the OMB mark?
                    If not, how much funding above the OMB mark should the Department request? $5
                    million, $50 million? $100 million? What should it be used for? To purchase
                    computers, to open posts, to add new positions?</p>
                <p>I was never satisfied that we in M/MO ever did a very good job. We never seemed
                    to have enough time. The budget is an exceedingly complicated document, yet it
                    never seemed to be available for us to look at until a day or two before it had
                    to be delivered to OMB. At that stage, the budget people did not want M/MO or
                    anyone else to recommend changes, since a change of figures in one section would
                    require changes throughout the budget package — and that meant a lot of work for
                    them. We in M/MO tried to interject ourselves earlier in the budget process, but
                    with not much success.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>M/MO had much more say and control over Department staffing. We monitored the
                    allocation of positions. Requests to establish, abolish or reprogram any
                    full-time position had to have M/MO approval. OMB imposed a position ceiling on
                    the Department, which meant that we could not have more people on the payroll at
                    the end of a fiscal year than authorized by our position ceiling. This did not
                    seriously hamper operations since the Department generally had a surplus of
                    positions to people. Funding to support these positions was much more of a
                    constraint. Shortly after I became Director of Management Operations, however,
                    in an effort to reduce the federal workforce, OMB introduced a new way of
                    monitoring and controlling the federal workforce, which it called “management by
                    FTE.” (FTE stands for full-time equivalent, with one FTE equal to one-person
                    year or 2,040 hours of paid employment). We in M/MO liked the new method of
                    monitoring employment, but thought that the FTE ceiling we were given did not
                    reflect the true FTE needs of the Department. For example, we were given no FTE
                    for short-term training or for home leave, even though the Department expended
                    hundreds of FTE each year for these purposes. OMB was reluctant to raise our FTE
                    ceiling, but we battled hard and in the end succeeded in getting the ceiling
                    raised. To insure that the Department didn't exceed its ceiling, we had to
                    monitor consumption on a biweekly basis. This was a major headache, given the
                    deplorable state of the Department's personnel data base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were looking at staffing, and something that has
                        struck me. I am a retired Foreign Service Officer but have not been involved
                        in as much political/economic reporting, however, it always has struck me
                        that in many of the large countries we have rather large staffs looking in
                        exquisite detail at the political life of the country where it seems that an
                        ambassador with a good political officer could pretty well cover the major
                        things. We don't have to know down to the county level. But then there is
                        the other side of the coin where Congress and other Bureaus keep demanding
                        reports and all. We want to have relations with a country but it doesn't
                        really serve the republic to look in exquisite detail in France, up and down
                        the place, outside of reporting what happens when it happens. Did you get
                        into that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, we got into that in a couple of ways. As funding for operations
                    tightened, the Department could no longer expect to receive additional positions
                    and funding to perform new functions. We had to reprogram from within, stop
                    doing something to be able to do something new. To find additional resources to
                    do additional economic reporting or trade promotion work, we began to cut back
                    to some extent on the political reporting.</p>
                <p>The second way we got at it was through our review of consulates. In that review,
                    we looked closely at what our consulates were actually doing. When we looked at
                    Rotterdam, for example, the European Bureau said Rotterdam was the home district
                    of some important members of the Dutch parliament, yet when we looked at
                    reporting coming out of the consulate, we found very little reporting on these
                    parliamentarians or local politics. In the end, we concluding that maybe this
                    reporting wasn't important after all. Maybe we need as much detailed reporting
                    from the hinterland as we thought we needed in the past. So you had this taking
                    place.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>My own view, looking at staffing changes over the years, is that political
                    staffing is probably as low as it should go without giving up something of
                    significance. If we cut even more, other agencies, CIA in particular, may move
                    in feeling that there was something there that they wanted to know about and if
                    State wasn't going to do it, they would do it themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is always a problem. Is there anything else on the
                        management side? Did you get any feel while you were in management for the
                        Reagan Administration? You had a President who was constantly stating that
                        the trouble with government was government. He was always talking about
                        government not doing its job, it is too expensive, etc. Did that reflect in
                        your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: The Reagan Administration did try to cut back on the Federal work force.
                    But the cuts in state were really not serious. What was more serious was the
                    preferential treatment of the CIA. The CIA expanded rapidly during the Reagan
                    years, thanks to Bill Casey's aggressiveness. State did not do a very good job
                    of arguing the importance of State's work as opposed to that of the CIA. As a
                    result Bill Casey corralled resources that in my opinion should have been
                    allocated to State, since much of the work of collecting intelligence can be
                    done as effectively and cheaper by the Department of State than by the CIA. As a
                    result of CIA's ample funding, it soon began to encroach on work that
                    traditionally had been performed by State. It got into the business of
                    collecting intelligence overtly, when that should have been left to State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then we come to 1987.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Well, it was time to move on. In 1982 or 83, when I was working as
                    Executive Assistant to the Under Secretary for Management, I had been nominated
                    by the State Department to go to Zimbabwe as ambassador. The nomination was
                    approved by the White House and I was told to get ready to go. I thought it made
                    good sense. I knew Mugabe and the issues. At that time the practice was for
                    President Reagan to call people to invite them to be his ambassador-designate to
                    country A, B or C. In due course, a number of people whose name went over to the
                    White House about the same time as mine, began getting their calls. But I
                    didn't. Initially I didn't worry too much about it, but after a time I began to
                    wonder if something had happened to my nomination.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Then one day I was called in and told that the White House had changed its mind,
                    that I was no longer the President's nominee for Zimbabwe. I thought I was being
                    bumped for a political appointee, but this was not the case. The White House
                    just didn't want De Pree as ambassador to Zimbabwe. State could nominate another
                    career officer and that would be fine. My immediate reaction was, “What in the
                    world have I done to incur the displeasure of the White House? What is behind
                    this?” No one could give me a satisfactory answer. All I was told was that I
                    should just be patient, that in time I would get another mission. The problem
                    was that Zimbabwe was the mission I really wanted. It was the one where I
                    thought I could be most effective.</p>
                <p>After failing to get satisfaction from the Department, I finally went to the
                    Hill, to my Congressman, Guy Vander Jagt, who I knew quite well. Guy was a
                    Republican, well-regarded in the White House, and would I thought, find out for
                    me why the White House had changed its mind. Guy did this for me. From what he
                    reported, and I was able to pick up elsewhere, I learned that someone from the
                    intelligence community working in the White House had intervened and persuaded
                    the personnel people in the White House that I was the wrong choice. I don't
                    want to mention names here. I know who it was. I think I mentioned before when
                    we talked about Mozambique that I had a very good relationship with Robert
                    Mugabe. I thought this was a mark in my favor, but it may not have been
                    perceived as such by Bill Casey and the White House figures who were busy
                    battling the “Evil Empire.” To some in the Reagan Administration, Mugabe was
                    “untrustworthy”. If the Administration entertained thoughts of a covert
                    operation in Zimbabwe — and I think they did — then it should have an ambassador
                    in Zimbabwe who would be sympathetic or supportive of what they might have in
                    mind. Given the relationship I had with Mugabe, I would have been perceived as
                    an obstacle. Indeed, I would have been a problem for them. Thus, the White House
                    was right to pull my nomination if they were looking for someone sympathetic to
                    what I was told some people had in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you are really saying is that we had an activist CIA
                        at that time and it was seen this new country, Zimbabwe...we saw the Cubans
                        everywhere an all this...they really wanted to have somebody with whom they
                        could work with easier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. I certainly would have gone to Zimbabwe thinking that Mugabe was a
                    person with whom we could work to promote our interests as well as the interests
                    of the Zimbabweans. There were some in the Administration who read the situation
                    differently. Of course, I was angry that the Department didn't really go to bat
                    for me and insist on giving me my day in court. But by the time I discovered the
                    reason why my name had been pulled, someone else had been appointed and in place
                    in Harare.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Well, time passed and while Reagan was still President, I was told that the
                    Department was prepared to submit my name again for an ambassadorial
                    appointment. I was told what posts were coming up. Bangladesh was one. I was
                    asked if I would serve in Bangladesh and I said, “Yes, I would.” My nomination
                    went through this time without difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Bangladesh, isn't it sort of out of your area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, it is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it is unflatteringly called a basket case, the armpit
                        of Asia. It is a poor country with no real solution at hand, or at least
                        that is the general feeling. What made you say you would do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I guess I didn't want to stay on much longer on the management side. I
                    had been in Washington for seven years and I wanted another overseas assignment.
                    There weren't many posts coming open at that time. None in Africa in which I was
                    interested. But I agree with you Stu, I had not served in the subcontinent,
                    although I had served in hardship posts with significant Moslem
                    populations...Egypt, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Mozambique. Also, I had voiced my
                    view to Ron Spiers and others that, in selecting candidates for ambassadors, the
                    Department should look for the best qualified officers. I recommended that when
                    a post came open, we begin the search by asking, “All right, who are the ten
                    best candidates for this post,” and start from that point, instead of saying,
                    “All right, who are the people who currently have to be taken care of or are due
                    for an assignment” and then try to match a person to a post. As a matter of
                    fact, for the post of Bangladesh, I was competing at that time with somebody who
                    came out of the south Asian area and who, in my judgment, was better qualified
                    than I was for that post. I told Ron Spiers that when queried about Bangladesh.
                    I said that I was prepared to wait and take my chances on another posting, but
                    Ron told me that there was nothing else coming up, and if I wanted another
                    posting I should take this one. I did.</p>
                <p>South Asia was a new area for me. Our major interest in Bangladesh was
                    developmental. As you said, many consider it a basket case. 112 million people
                    live in Bangladesh, in an area the size of Wisconsin, very densely populated,
                    and subject to all types of natural disasters. Politically, it didn't engage the
                    attention of the senior people in the NEA Bureau. As a matter of fact when I
                    went out, Dick Murphy said that he hoped it would stay that way. For the most
                    part, it did. We did have a major flood in 1988, the worst in Bangladesh's
                    living history. Of course, the US government responded promptly, as we always
                    do. But this was largely something USAID handled and the NEA bureau at the desk
                    level. We had one or two political issues. Democracy in Bangladesh was one.
                    Steve Solarz was chairman of the Asian Subcommittee and held annual hearings.
                    Bangladesh was a military government, and we were trying to persuade the
                    government to hold free and fair elections. They didn't come about while I was
                    there. But it wasn't for lack of trying.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>But the major issues were developmental. We had a big program, about $150 million
                    of development aid and humanitarian relief a year. I had a very professional AID
                    staff who wanted to be there because of the challenge. They were good at their
                    job. I was very pleased with the aid effort that we made. I think we got good
                    value for our $150 million.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of aid were we giving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Family planning was one major focus. We were trying to reduce the growth
                    rate. That country doesn't stand much of a chance unless the birth rate goes
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we going about this? Certainly under the Reagan
                        Administration they were opposed to abortion, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. At one time, the US assisted the government of Bangladesh in its
                    vasectomy and sterilization program. We had to get out of that largely because
                    of the opposition of Senator Helms. The government of Bangladesh had been giving
                    a woman a little less than $5 when she came in to be sterilized. The money was
                    intended to provide her with a clean sari once she had the operation and to
                    reimburse her (and her escort) for the cost of transportation to and from the
                    hospital or clinic. Senator Helms and critics thought this payment was an
                    incentive to be sterilized. AID discontinued funding for this particular program
                    rather than jeopardize funding for its other projects. But we continued to
                    assist the Government in other aspects of its family planning effort. One was to
                    help get condoms onto the local market. We had quite a success here, with more
                    than a billion sold under the program. The US wasn't the only donor, but we were
                    crucial to its success.</p>
                <p>A second major area of assistance was in rural electrification, helping extend
                    electricity into the villages to open up job opportunities and to improve the
                    lot of the people. This was a very popular program with the Bangladeshis.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The third major area of our development assistance was in fertilizer
                    distribution. We got into this work when USAID explored why crop yield and the
                    use of fertilizer in Bangladesh lagged far behind that in neighboring India. The
                    obstacle we found was the bureaucracy, which controlled fertilizer distribution.
                    Bureaucrats at the fertilizer depots were insisting on under-the-table payments
                    from the farmers. Rather than put up with this corruption and harassment, the
                    farmers simply stopped buying fertilizer. USAID proposed to government that it
                    privatize the sale of fertilizer. Despite strong opposition from the civil
                    servants, the government agreed to let the private sector compete with the
                    government in selling fertilizer. This took political courage, for the public
                    section unions were strong. Private entrepreneurs were quick to get into the
                    business. With this alternative available, the farmers began to go to the
                    private sector to get their fertilizer. Usage went up as did crop yield and
                    farmer income. It was quite a success story.</p>
                <p>Throughout my tour in Bangladesh, the opposition parties kept urging us to
                    withdraw our aid from the government, contending that it was US and other donor
                    aid that was making it possible for a corrupt government to remain in power. “We
                    will never have democracy in Bangladesh until you stop your aid,” they said.
                    After about a year in the country, I decided to address this matter head on in a
                    speech I gave to the Dhaka Rotary Club. I reviewed the US aid effort, program by
                    program. I asked the audience if they wanted us to cut off our support for
                    family planning. “Oh no,” they said, “we need your support for Family Planning.”
                    “Do you want us to continue our support for rural electrification?” “Oh, yes,
                    this is one of your good programs. We can see the payoff. Keep it up.” “Well,
                    what about the fertilizer business?” Then I explained what and why we were
                    active in this field. Here too, the audience thought the program made good
                    sense, and that we should continue. “Well then,” I said, “You've just asked me
                    to continue almost everything we're doing.” The speech was given prominent play
                    in the Bangladesh media. The opposition didn't much like it at all. The
                    communist press even urged the government to declare me persona non grata. But
                    our large aid effort did get a lot of attention and a lot of praise.</p>
                <p>I had some reservations about the opposition. Their rhetoric was good, but I
                    wasn't so sure their performance would be much better then the government in
                    power. One day, one of the leaders of one of the opposition parties came to me
                    with a proposal. He said that he had come up with a formula to get free and fair
                    elections in Bangladesh. The proposal was for me to persuade President Ershad to
                    set a date for country-wide elections, then go on vacation, turn the government
                    over to a caretaker administration and await the results. If Ershad won the
                    election, the opposition would accept the result, and call off their street
                    action. This particular opposition leader had put this proposal in writing. At
                    the bottom of the proposal was the note, “To demonstrate the government's
                    determination to carry through on this program, they should agree that the
                    outcome of this election should be as follows:...” So much for champions of free
                    and fair elections.</p>
                <p>Yes, Dhaka was a fascinating assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I had excellent access, as did all my predecessors. Bangladeshis are
                    favorably disposed to the US. We have a large AID presence and they appreciate
                    it. They know we have no ulterior interest in the country. The government in
                    office had come to power through a military takeover. The opposition, whose
                    leaders I would see on a regular basis, were clamoring for elections, but set
                    conditions that the government found unacceptable. I was using the residence to
                    bring government and opposition together in hopes they could resolve their
                    difference, but without success. As time went on, the opposition parties called
                    national strikes (hartals) and took to street violence to force the government's
                    hand.</p>
                <p>These hartals created problems for our embassy's operations. Until we built a new
                    embassy, which we occupied in 1989, our embassy was located in the middle of
                    town. Because of the violence associated with the hartals, we closed the embassy
                    to the public on hartal days. We kept a skeleton staff in the mission, the
                    others stayed home, reporting by telephone. USIA's library was burnt down during
                    one of the hartals. In one three month period, the embassy was closed to the
                    public 28 working days.</p>
                <p>I think no matter who is in power in Bangladesh, even a government of angels,
                    there will be a strong built-in opposition, because no government in a country
                    as desperately poor as Bangladesh is going to be able to bring about any rapid
                    improvement in the lives of a large percentage of the population. The problems
                    are just too horrendous for that.</p>
                <p>But Bangladesh is here to stay, “viable” or not. There is no possibility of it
                    rejoining India. Nor, after the bloodshed of 1971, is it likely to ever reunite
                    with formerly West Pakistan. But bleak as its future may be, life for the
                    Bangladeshis can be better than it has been. US and other donor aid has made a
                    difference. In time, if they can keep the birth rate down, the Bangladeshis may
                    even be able to feed themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with the role of India there? It
                        looks as a practical matter that Bangladesh should really be amalgamated
                        some how into India or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, India was a major player on the local scene. Many Bangladeshis saw
                    the government of India as the principal enemy, even though at the time
                    Bangladesh took up arms against the West Pakistanis, it was India that came in
                    and enabled the Bangladeshis to become independent. Much of this anti-India
                    feeling is fanned by the Muslim fundamentalists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all with the Indians, the Indian
                        Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes. There was no problem dealing with the Indians. I don't think the
                    Indians perceived us as a threat to their interests in the area. Our focus was
                    almost exclusively on development aid and quiet efforts, largely behind the
                    scenes, with government to improve the human rights record and get on with the
                    job of promoting democracy and a market economy.</p>
                <p>There was some international media attention on human rights violations in the
                    Chittagong Hill tracts along the border with Burma and India. The government had
                    to bring in troops there to suppress an insurgency. We and others urged the
                    government to exercise better controls over their troops in the area and to
                    permit Amnesty International people to monitor developments. The government did
                    respond to these appeals. The situation in the Hill Tracts had improved by the
                    time I left Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>In terms of the encouragement of the private sector, I think the government's
                    record was reasonably good. Privatization of the state-run jute mills had
                    slowed, but the government was moving away from state management of the economy
                    and encouraging the private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this time the Soviet Union was beginning to collapse.
                        Were the Soviets or the Chinese playing any particular role there at the

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: No. China and the Soviet Union both had missions in Bangladesh, but the
                    Western countries were the big donors: the World Bank, the US, the Nordics, the
                    Dutch and others. Bangladesh professed to be non-aligned, but there was a
                    decided pro-West bias. This was particularly true of the military. Bangladesh
                    did send troops to the Persian Gulf during the war against Iraq.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, and for the last three years, Stu, I have been working as a Senior
                    Inspector, heading inspection teams. I had three years of that before I retired
                    in September of 1993.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a difference in the inspection business than
                        when you were there before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes, there was somewhat more focus on policy matters than there had been
                    in the past. We looked at the mission's Program plan. What was the mission
                    trying to accomplish? How well informed are the people at post with the policy?
                    How much participation did they have with respect to policy formulation? We
                    looked at whether there was a fit between policy objectives, what we were trying
                    to accomplish, and the resources we had out there to achieve our policy. Were we
                    trying to do more than the resources could hope to accomplish. We looked at
                    program and personnel resources. If we as inspectors perceived there was an
                    imbalance, that we might be trying to accomplish too much with too little, we
                    would note that. Or if we were trying to accomplish something that in terms of
                    our global interests was of low priority, we would report that too.</p>
                <p>Let me give you an example of a significant policy issue where we as inspectors
                    had something to say. We went to China, Hong Kong and Mongolia on one inspection
                    cycle. This was just before Congress had to vote on Most Favored Nation treaty
                    status for Mainland China. We noted the $14 billion imbalance of trade we had
                    with Mainland China. We looked at what staffing we had in our Chinese posts and
                    in Hong Kong to try to redress this imbalance. We observed that trade promotion
                    officers could make a difference. In Guangzhou, for example, one officer
                    accompanied a group of Chinese to a food processing fair in the United States
                    and came back with close to $30 million worth of orders and another $60 million
                    in joint investment. This could not have been accomplished without the
                    participation of that one officer. We then went to Hong Kong, where again we
                    observed the effectiveness of our trade promotion effort. We were convinced that
                    the assignment of more trade promotion officers in China and Hong Kong would pay
                    off. Where would they come from? We thought they might come from posts in the
                    former Soviet Union, where our trade promotion officers were unable to generate
                    as much additional trade as had originally been projected. For example, in just
                    seven months, US exports to Hong Kong, much of which was destined for China,
                    equaled all our exports to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union put
                    together for an entire year. Yet the number of trade promotion officers we had
                    in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was much greater than what we had
                    in China. So we recommended that some of these trade promotion resources be
                    reprogrammed to China or Hong Kong. That is the type of policy issue that we
                    addressed.</p>

                <p>As inspectors we also looked closely at a post's policy instruction and guidance.
                    Were our policy objectives clearly spelled out in the mission's program plan or
                    the letter of instruction to the ambassador? Before we went out to inspect our
                    embassy in Yemen we were told that there could and should be no improvement in
                    relations between the United States and Yemen so long as the government of Yemen
                    continued to maintain its close relationship with Saddam Hussein. We wanted to
                    keep the pressure on the Yemen Government. Yet when we arrived at post, we
                    observed that the post was actively working to improve relations. The Peace
                    Corps wanted to get back in, USAID was stepping up its program activity, the
                    embassy was exploring whether US military personnel could lecture at Yemen's
                    Staff College. Since the Government of Yemen was still maintaining its close
                    relationship with Saddam Hussein, it seemed to us as inspectors that the
                    embassy, with the best of intentions, might be getting out ahead of what we had
                    been told was our US policy interest not to improve relations until Yemen backed
                    off in its support of Iraq. We reviewed this issue with policy makers in the
                    Department and the National Security Council when we returned from our
                    inspection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the impressions I have, and this is only an
                        impression, going back to the State Department on the inspection side, is
                        you are sending people out into some very dangerous countries, as the State
                        Department does. There are bombings and all and you have posters saying
                        “Report Waste, Fraud and Mismanagement.” It seems like the thrust of the
                        inspection corps had been to try to come up with scalps of people who have
                        wasted, fraud or mismanaged. Did you have that feeling while you were in it
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: I think that is a misperception, Stu. You must remember that OIG, the
                    Office of Inspector General, has four components. The office of inspection is
                    just one of these components. A security oversight unit looks at the state of
                    security at our posts, the audit unit looks at how funds are being managed, and
                    the third unit, the investigations unit, investigates specific allegations of
                    malfeasance, theft, etc. We in the office of inspections were not trying to get
                    anyone's scalp. Our purpose was to try to improve the management of our
                    diplomatic posts and bureaus and offices in the Department of State. We were
                    well aware that over the last ten/fifteen years the Department has been cutting
                    administrative support. We cut funding for travel, we cut funding for post
                    language training, we cut funding for maintenance. We have been cutting
                    positions. We are also sending a lot of inexperienced people on assignment. This
                    is particularly true of general services officers, who are in short supply. In
                    Guinea Bissau, for example, clearly one of our most challenging posts for an
                    administrative officer, we sent out a junior officer as GSO with no prior GSO
                    experience. This wasn't fair to the post. If you do that, and at the same time
                    cut maintenance funding, inevitably you are going to have deficiencies. I urged
                    my inspection team to remember this when assessing how well the post was doing.
                    While we did point out deficiencies, we were always careful to note that some of
                    these deficiencies were inevitable, given the resources made available to the
                    post. Often the fault was with the Department as much as it was with the post
                    being inspected. I think most of the inspection teams took this approach.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Inspector General during that time? He has
                        just retired, but made quite an impression, Sherman Funk. Could you talk a
                        bit about your impression of him and how he operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: He was a marvelous person to work for. When we returned from an
                    inspection, we of course would meet with him to review our major findings and
                    recommendation. He would listen. He wouldn't always agree with us, but he would
                    hear us out. If we could convince him that our findings were valid and our
                    recommendations made sense, he would fight hard to see our recommendations
                    carried out.</p>
                <p>For example, my last overseas inspection was to Poland. I think there were 12
                    junior consular officers in Warsaw, Krakow and Poznan. That cost the Department
                    a lot of money. Each officer had to receive language training, housing, and his
                    or her allowances. It probably cost the Department $150 or $200 thousand a year
                    to support each officer. Our inspection team believed that the work of three of
                    these consular officers could be accomplished by a qualified spouse. There was
                    one qualified spouse at post, for example, who spoke fluent Polish, had received
                    consular training at Consulate General Rosslyn, and had actually had previous
                    consular experience. We learned that some of the spouses of officers coming out
                    to post that summer were interested in doing consular work. So our inspection
                    team recommended that three positions be filled by qualified spouses; saving the
                    government perhaps $500 thousand per year.</p>
                <p>When we got back we were told that the Department was prepared to employ spouses
                    in lieu of officers, but not in Warsaw. They didn't want to do it for Poland,
                    they said, because junior officers are eager to go to Poland. They would test
                    the program instead in London, even though the cost saving for the Department in
                    London would be appreciably less than in Poland. This doesn't make sense when
                    the Department claims to be strapped for funds. Once again, the Department is
                    hostage to its permissive bidding system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things as I do these interviews, those of our
                        generation when asked why did you go to a certain post respond, “Well, I was
                        told to go there.” You made your bid but if you were assigned elsewhere you
                        kind of gritted your teeth and said, “Okay, I'll go.” Whereas I get the
                        feeling that now you almost go into the assignment process with your
                        attorney. Unfortunately the system also contributes to this in that if you
                        don't get a certain type of job this can have a major affect on your future
                        career, whereas before everybody knew you had not the greatest jobs and
                        other good jobs and it all averaged out.</hi>

                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>DE PREE: I think the Department's assignment system needs a major overhaul. The
                    needs of the Service, not the wishes of the officer, must prevail. Let me cite
                    another example. We saw it in Bratislava. The post needed another general
                    service officer. We had opened an embassy, we were getting a new residence, we
                    had a new team coming in, and housing was hard to come by. So the inspection
                    team recommended another GSO position, at least for the next two years. We had
                    already found a position offset, having recommended the abolishment of half a
                    dozen positions in Poland. We came back and talked to the assignment people.
                    They said they couldn't support the recommendation because nobody will bid on
                    Bratislava. They said they could put a new support position in Vienna because
                    officers will bid on Vienna. I said, “But the need is in Bratislava. If you put
                    someone in Vienna, that officer is going to spend at least half, if not more, of
                    his or her time in Vienna. If you assign an officer to Bratislava, and he or she
                    wouldn't go, sack the officer.” But that's not likely to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did that to people who wouldn't go to Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DE PREE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. I thank you very much.</hi>
