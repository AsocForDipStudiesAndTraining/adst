                <p>Interviewed by: Ann Miller Morin </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: May 10, 1985</p>

                <p>HEALY: Let me begin, Ann, by talking about my early years and education, which is
                    an easy matter for me to discuss from the top of my head. I'll keep on going and
                    as soon as I get to a point where I will have to consider what I want to say or
                    search my memory, I'll stop.</p>
                <p>Let me begin then with place of birth, hometown. I was born in Brooklyn, New York
                    in 1932. My parents had married in 1930. The first of the four children, my
                    sister Mary Catherine Maureen was born in 1931. I came along a year later, my
                    brother Joe was born in 1934, and the last of us, my brother Frank was born in
                    1939. That just gives you the details of the birth.</p>
                <p>Now, parents' background. My father, Anthony J. Healy, was born in Belfast in
                    northern Ireland, one of about eight children. His father had died when he was
                    quite young, and I know my father mentioned being an apprentice to a foundry
                    when he was ten or eleven or twelve, or whatever. He didn't have much schooling,
                    of course. He generally said he was in school for three years before finally
                    going into this apprentice program. Things in Belfast were very bad in the early
                    1920s and in 1923 my grandmother, Catherine Reid Healy, I believe it was,
                    decided to take all her children and immigrate to Canada where her oldest
                    daughter, Catherine, had gone some time earlier than 1923 with her new husband
                    to settle down and marry. My grandmother then took her entire family from
                    Belfast to the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan area. My father farmed with some of his
                    brothers for about five years. And in 1928 he and two of his brothers came down
                    to the New York City area.</p>
                <p>My father worked, I believe, in a garage for a year or two, but by the time he
                    married my mother in 1930 he was working for the Hudson and Manhattan railroad,
                    which was a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania railroad, and he worked for the
                    Hudson and Manhattan through its many changes until, I believe, it became part
                    of the PATH system in New York City. He worked for the railroad until he
                    retired.</p>
                <p>As I say, I have no relatives I'm aware of left in Ireland on my father's side,
                    but I do have a fair number of Canadian relatives based on my Canadian aunts and
                    uncles and I've been in touch with a handful of them off and on throughout the
                    years.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My mother was Mary Catherine Kennedy. She was the oldest of seven or eight
                    children born to, let's see, my grandfather's name was James Kennedy and my
                    grandmother's name on the maternal side was Mary Boyle. My grandfather Kennedy
                    farmed in the Maas area of County Donegal near the Great Geebarra Bay. It was a
                    small farm and not very prosperous. My mother, again, did not have much
                    opportunity for schooling. As the oldest of seven or eight children she was soon
                    recruited by her own mother to help take care of the younger children.</p>
                <p>When my mother was 23 she emigrated to the United States. I know she spent six
                    months with a couple of aunts in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, coming to know
                    something about the United States including using an indoor bathroom, I presume,
                    for the first time in her life. Then she began working as a live-in maid for a
                    family, or perhaps two different families, for the next three to five years. By
                    this time she had been joined by a couple of brothers and a sister. They were
                    all living together in Brooklyn, New York, and my mother worked as a waitress,
                    in a dinette, I guess. It was in Brooklyn that my parents married in 1930. Now
                    that takes care, I guess, of parents' background. Is there anything else, Ann,
                    that you would like to know about parents' background?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I think that's very concise and very helpful. The fact
                        is that because of circumstances you really didn't have grandparents in your
                        life, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No. I did have aunts and uncles, though, because my father had two
                    brothers living in the New York area and my mother had a sister and a brother.
                    One brother did return to Ireland with his family. He is the one who assumed the
                    running of the family farm for my grandfather and inherited the farm formally or
                    informally, I do not know, when my grandfather died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a close family situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Pretty close. Yes. My mother, whatever her reasons, had never been back to
                    Ireland on a visit. Not that there was much money available for trips back to
                    Ireland, but her sister managed to go back now and again, my Aunt Bridget, that
                    would be. But my mother never went back to Ireland until 1958. On one of my
                    first possibilities in the Foreign Service, I stopped off in Ireland to visit my
                    aunts and my uncles. That would be '58. It was as a result of this visit and the
                    persuasion of my uncles that I talked my mother into visiting Ireland for the
                    first time in what would then be thirty-seven, thirty-six years. I'm afraid that
                    the emotional shock of going back to Ireland in 1959 was really a little bit too
                    much for her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HEALY: Her parents had been alive when she left. The youngest of her brothers and
                    sisters, Aunt Annie, had been a girl of ten when she left Ireland, and Danny at
                    that point was pushing 50. So it was really a very emotional time for her and
                    she never went back to Ireland again after that. I have been back off and on as
                    I pass to and from European assignments. My sister finally managed to make a
                    trip to Ireland about two years ago. On the other hand, when it comes to my Aunt
                    Bridget's family, Aunt Bridget went back about every four or five years, and in
                    fact has quite a story about almost being caught in Ireland when the war broke
                    out in Europe in 1939, and having to pack up her children and grab one of the
                    last ships out of the Irish ports or Liverpool, I'm not certain what.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any emotional ties to Ireland when you go
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I know these are my aunts and my uncles and my first cousins but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The country itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, the country is a beautiful country. But no, I feel myself thoroughly
                    American. I had this dichotomy of feeling. I know in theory that my heritage is
                    100% Irish all the way back. But on the other hand, I also feel that somehow or
                    another I must have had relatives who came over with the Mayflower or whatever,
                    and I identify very much with the French and Indian war and the Pilgrims and the
                    revolution and things like that. Given the prevalence of the name Healy and
                    Kennedy in this country, for all I know I do have relatives who came over two
                    hundred years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Religious training: both my mother and my father, of course, were brought
                    up as Roman Catholics, and instilled the same training in us, further reinforced
                    by about 100% exposure to Catholic education. I had eight years at St. Agatha
                    grammar school in the heart of Brooklyn, south Brooklyn. I had four years at the
                    Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School, a diocesan high school, a scholarship
                    high school in Brooklyn. Then I had four years at St. John's University, which
                    then was also in Brooklyn, although St. John's is now located in Jamaica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any of those all girls?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>HEALY: The elementary school, of course, was coeducational, but secondary school
                    was all girls. The college, St. John's University, was mixed again, coed. I
                    don't know if there is anything else to say about religious training except
                    that, of course, it was a very strong religious training. The educational system
                    was, again, strong. But it was also basically a very good academic education
                    apart from the religious aspects of it. And Bishop McDonnell Memorial High
                    School in particular took great pride in its academic training program, since it
                    was designed to educate the scholarship holders from every catholic elementary
                    school in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes. It was a scholarship program and the top two or three girls from each
                    of the grammar schools had a free education at this high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had a very good education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It was the kind of education that I found, fortunately, stacked up very
                    well with the kind of education provided by private schools in New England.
                    Three years of Latin, three years of French, four years of history, three years
                    of math, three years of science, the whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very academic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: And even St. John's, while not, of course particularly in those days,
                    first ranked academically, still required for the bachelor's degree in history,
                    which I took, such old-fashioned courses of study as 18 credits in philosophy
                    and six credits in math and eight credits in science, etcetera, etcetera. Q:
                    Were any of your aunts and uncles, nuns or priests?</p>
                <p>HEALY: No, interestingly enough - let me take that back a minute. Despite the
                    strong religious training, on my mother's side nobody, so far as I'm aware, had
                    any interest in the religious life or took any preliminary training toward the
                    priesthood or toward becoming a nun.</p>
                <p>On my father's side, on the other hand, the eldest brother, Uncle Andy, who lived
                    in Patterson, he was very, very religious and I think almost every one of his
                    four or five sons made some kind of effort at pursuing a priestly vocation. Only
                    one actually ended up becoming a priest. He's a missionary in Japan.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Again, another one of my father's brothers, my Uncle Pat, had only two children,
                    but his daughter, Eileen, who was almost exactly my age, Eileen was thinking in
                    terms of becoming a nun but that never worked out despite some early preliminary
                    training. Despite the kind of background we had had, we are not one of the
                    religious families where everybody becomes a nun or a priest. I'll leave
                    religious training then, if you have no other questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I'll go on to relations with siblings. There's nothing much to be said
                    there. We were all fairly close in age except for the youngest, Frank. My
                    sister, Mary Catherine, was a year older. She attended St. Agatha's school a
                    year ahead of me. She attended the Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School a year
                    ahead of me, and she went on to St. John's University a year ahead of me.</p>
                <p>Maureen wasn't initially interested in going to college, but at some point in her
                    final year in high school she decided she was going to become a school teacher.I
                    knew that I wanted to go to college from an early age, but I didn't know quite
                    what I wanted to be. I ended up taking a degree in history simply because that
                    was the subject in which I had my best marks in and it was the one that
                    interested me most.</p>
                <p>My brother, Joe, went the equivalent of Bishop McDonnell, St. Michael's High
                    School in Brooklyn. He took a business degree at St. John's and after two or
                    three years investigating jobs and working at jobs in the business world, he
                    went back to school to take his degree in elementary education and became an
                    elementary school teacher as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, so that's two who were teachers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes, and I taught as well, of course, although I didn't take my degree in
                    education.</p>
                <p>Frank was the youngest and unfortunately suffered from following three A
                    students. Poor Frank was a B student, which we thought was almost totally
                    unacceptable in the context of the marks we were making. Frank was always the
                    happy one of the family. My mother always compared him to one of her younger
                    brothers, who hated school but knew how to run a business. She decided that
                    Frank was the one who was going to get into business and make money. As it
                    turned out, Frank developed diabetes when he was about 13 and died in 1980 when
                    he was 41.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you fight with your sister?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>HEALY: Not much, because I tended to be a quiet person. Maureen would indeed try
                    to dominate and I just went my own way without any fights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Passive resistance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Passive resistance. Maureen was a more social person than I. I was more
                    interested in reading books. If anything, I probably fought with Frank, although
                    we didn't really fight. I was just trying very hard to get him to study hard and
                    get my mother not to keep him home when the weather was bad. But I don't
                    recollect that we had much in the way of fights. Our interests were all quite
                    different. Maureen was interested in social things, I was interested in books,
                    Joe was interested in basketball, and Frank was interested in going out with the
                    boys and having fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did you use to play with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Friends in the neighborhood. In elementary school my best friend was in my
                    class at St. Agatha's. But Helen unfortunately came down with a rheumatic heart
                    when she was in the sixth grade and she died when she was 17, after years in the
                    hospital. I had some little friends around the neighborhood, but not much.
                    Again, because I was too much of a bookworm, and I preferred reading a book to
                    being on the street playing with the girls, although I was a tomboy until I was
                    about eleven or twelve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you? What sort of things, playing ball?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Playing handball with the boys, playing king, climbing trees. Climbing
                    trees with a book in my hand. But in high school, unfortunately, it was more
                    difficult to make friends because it took an hour by subway to get to high
                    school, and of course an hour home. The girls themselves came from everywhere in
                    Brooklyn and Queens and scattered immediately classes were over. I did belong to
                    the orchestra in high school, as did my sister. That provided some friendships,
                    but never very close because, as I say, the girls lived out on the island. We
                    just wouldn't see each other except in classes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you play?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HEALY: Maureen and I both took piano lessons while we were growing up. Maureen
                    had joined the orchestra before I went to Bishop's, so I joined it too. I was
                    interested in music as was she. Maureen ended up started on the violin. All the
                    girls who joined the orchestra played only the piano. Nobody played anything
                    else. So they taught us all how to play an instrument. They taught Maureen
                    violin, but Maureen doesn't have a good ear. She's a bit tone deaf and doesn't
                    have a singing voice, for example. So after about a year on the violin, they
                    assigned her to the piano. I do have a good ear and I stayed with the violin
                    until, oh, I guess, a year before graduation. It turned out that the cellos were
                    graduating and they needed a cello player. So I switched over to the cello. We
                    weren't a bad orchestra, but we were not very professional. It was a lot of fun
                    though, and I enjoyed that part of high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now your family, you had two girls, and then two boys. You
                        all seemed to have been treated exactly the same as far as getting
                        ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I would say so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously your parents must have encouraged you or you
                        wouldn't have all been to college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: They didn't discourage us from anything. I don't remember my father ever
                    saying to me, “You have to go to college,” or my mother. Although when it came
                    right down to the line and Maureen indicated she was going to work her way
                    through St. John's, my mother was very discouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, only in the sense that things were always very tight financially.
                    And she looked forward to having her oldest going to business and earning a
                    salary and bringing more money into the house. So the thought that Maureen was
                    going to go to St. John's, and would have to work her way through, and would not
                    be bringing money into the house was, I think, something hard for my mother to
                    understand. My father was always very encouraging. He just said flat out, “Go
                    ahead. You'll have to earn the tuition, but you've got room and board here as
                    long as you need it.” My mother was soon reconciled to this whole idea that we
                    were all going to end up going to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your sister sort of paved the way for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HEALY: She did. In fact it was always very easy for me. One reason why I tended
                    to be fairly quiet, is that Maureen would make the fight for the lipstick and I
                    just wear the lipstick as soon as she did, although I was a year younger. When
                    Maureen made the fight for a house key, I got a housekeep. When Maureen was
                    allowed to date, I was allowed to date. There is some advantage to having a
                    sister who's only a year older.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Were your folks bookish at all, Terry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, as I say, my father only had three years of education and my mother
                    only about five, so they were not inclined toward books. My father would have
                    been inclined, I think, if he'd ever had the opportunity, but he didn't. It was
                    really a matter of just working hard. In fact in those days, I remember my
                    father had to work, this would be in the late thirties to the forties, it was a
                    matter of seven days a week, ten or twelve hours a day before they finally went
                    on strike sometime in the forties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this sort of a traditional marriage, where the father
                        is the head of the household and the mother...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Very much so. My father objected to my mother's one effort at working.
                    Toward the end of the war, my mother, through a friend, had the opportunity to
                    work on Governor's Island in the cafeteria there, for the army, I guess it would
                    have been. My father, I can remember, objected to this. His salary was better
                    now that the war had started, and he didn't feel there was any great need for
                    it. But my mother very much wanted to. So she did, in fact, for three or four
                    years. It worked out quite well because my father had always worked nights. The
                    money was better working nights. So my mother would go off to work at nine in
                    the morning, my father would be at home sleeping. My mother would get us off to
                    school, I guess. We'd come home and my father would be making lunch and when we
                    came home at three, my mother would be home. She only worked part-time. So it
                    all worked out very easily. But that was the only job she held, except for
                    little sewing jobs at home, the kind of thing you could do at home. My Aunt
                    Bridget was a fine seamstress and did a lot of very fine sewing at home, and my
                    mother did some of that work, big bundles of sewing stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she really?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, yes, she'd travel somewhere and pick up a bundle of stuff, and you'd
                    take it home and sew seams or something. My mother was never as good as my Aunt
                    Bridget, at least that was my understanding. I think my mother didn't have the
                    patience to be as good as Aunt Bridget. Aunt Bridget did a lot of fine sewing
                    and my mother did plainer sewing, but the money - I think she gave that up
                    fairly early on because the money was something like, god knows, $5 for a
                    hundred of whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she teach you home skills, how to sew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: She taught my sister, but I'm afraid I was somewhat resistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No cooking, or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I wasn't interested in cooking. My sister was more interested and I
                    remember she taught Maureen how to knit, but I wasn't interested. Anything that
                    took me away from books was just... I was not interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your Dad leave the raising of the children to your
                        mother?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Pretty much. Although when it came to discipline, my father was always
                    there and my mother was always threatening us with my father. Particularly where
                    the boys were concerned. When it comes to my sister and me, I don't recollect
                    much discipline. I think my mother raised her hand to me once in my life. When I
                    happened to be mentioning this to my sister sometime fairly recently, I guess we
                    were talking to my sister's children, and I said, “Your Grandmother Healy only
                    raised her hand to me once.” And my sister said, “She raised her hand to me a
                    second time.” But I don't know what got into us, we much have been about seven
                    or eight. My Aunt Bridget was visiting from a different section of Brooklyn,
                    from Flatbush in fact, with her oldest, my cousin Rosemary. Rosemary was six
                    months younger than Maureen and six months older than I, and whatever deviltry
                    got into us, we decided we were going to take Rosemary up to the local park,
                    Sunset Park, about six blocks away. We were going to leave her up there. This is
                    a little girl of six.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aren't kids awful?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HEALY: I can remember vividly, and my memory for my younger years is not very
                    good, but I remember this. We walked into the house and my mother looked at us
                    and I remember her voice saying, “Where's Rosemary?” Somehow or another, I guess
                    it was my sister said, “We left her up in Sunset park.” Well, we realized this
                    was the wrong thing to do because the next thing I remember, my mother raced out
                    of the house, ran, presumably ran the six blocks, found Rosemary, brought her
                    back and left her outside. At least she didn't punish us in front of Rosemary.
                    She then came into the house and proceeded to break one wooden hanger on my
                    sister and then reached for another wooden hanger and broke it on me. [laughter]
                    I think that was a lesson to us. I never thought of doing anything like that
                    again.</p>
                <p>My sister tells me that my mother really laid a hand on her once in high school
                    because Maureen had skipped a class, and my mother got a postcard in the mail
                    saying, “Your daughter, Mary Healy, was absent from school today.” When Maureen
                    came home, and my mother faced her with this card, Maureen never specified,
                    because after all she must have been fourteen, fifteen, but I get the impression
                    that if my mother had had a wooden coat hanger in hand that would have been
                    broken as well.</p>
                <p>The thing is things were understood. There were certain things you didn't do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was a loving situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Definitely. But, as I say, there were certain things you didn't do. Now as
                    to the boys, I cannot be too certain. My mother was more inclined to bring my
                    father in on disciplining the boys. And of course, by the time the boys needed
                    discipline, my sister and I were going to high school or college, working at all
                    kinds of jobs, never at home, never there on the weekend. Things could have
                    happened there that I'd be unaware of. But my impression is that apart from the
                    usual discipline problems, there was very little need for anything awful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major illnesses when you four were
                        little?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Thank god, no. Illnesses would have destroyed us because we simply didn't
                    have the money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>HEALY: But no, thank god, my mother was never ill. She never had an operation in
                    her life. My father was ill a couple of times with ulcers. He had two ulcer
                    operations before I was 16. But apart from that, he was never ill. My sister was
                    never ill. I was never ill, thank god. Joe was never ill. Frank came down with
                    the diabetes when he was twelve or thirteen, but by that time we were in a
                    better situation financially, and of course diabetes is not a disastrous
                    financial illness, disastrous as it is. But I would say the one thing you would
                    have noticed is that we never got to the dentist. Because that was a luxury to
                    go to the dentist. By the time we got to high school, it became important
                    because Bishop McDonnell, dealing as it did with a fairly poor population of
                    students, required a dental note in order to get a pass rate in gym.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: If you can believe it. I know that my sister, who had the highest grade
                    point average in her freshman class, was not on the honor roll because she had a
                    failure in gym, because she had not finished her dental work. I was in more or
                    less the same situation, although I certainly did not have the highest average
                    in my entering freshman class. But I received a failing mark in gym my first
                    time around because I hadn't completed my dental work. It was a necessary kind
                    of thing to do because otherwise we would never have gone to the dentist. It was
                    one of the... I still think about ... My sister, I know, feels that it changed
                    her entire high school life because she figured well what the hell, if I can
                    have the highest average in the class and not get on the honor roll, then I'm
                    not going to work any more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: She still had a very good record in high school, but she didn't work for
                    it. But it was necessary. Anyway that I think is enough about relations with
                    siblings and grammar school and high school.</p>
                <p>Relations with grandparents were non existent. My grandmother died in '31, I
                    think. My grandmother Healy died in '31, my grandfather Healy had died sometime
                    back about 1911 when my father was eleven. My grandmother Kennedy died at some
                    point long before I can remember. My grandfather Kennedy died at some point when
                    I probably was about ten. It would have been 1942 or 1943, because I can
                    remember coming home noticing that my mother was not herself and when I asked
                    what was wrong, she said she had a letter saying that her father had died. So
                    grandparents just didn't exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HEALY: Aunts and uncles, yes. We saw aunts and uncles, although there were family
                    fights there now and again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you close to any of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Geographically, you see, my father's brother, Andrew, was in Patterson. We
                    managed to get over to Patterson perhaps once every third or fourth year. My
                    father's brother, Patrick, lived in the neighborhood and my cousin Eileen was in
                    my grammar school class. So we were fairly close to them and saw a fair amount
                    of them. Although once again it was a matter of... Living only six or seven
                    blocks away meant a big difference in who you saw regularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: On my mother's side, Uncle Danny went back to Ireland with his family.
                    Uncle Pat and his family, we were close to them but they lived up in the Bronx.
                    That was a major undertaking in the subway. Her sister, Bridget, lived with her
                    family in Flatbush, and again it was more than an hour to get out to Flatbush
                    from south Brooklyn. So we were always in touch, but never that close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a favorite?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Probably Uncle Pat and Auntie Katie up in the Bronx were the ones we saw
                    most often and were the favorites. We saw more of them than any of the others.
                    Of course, Uncle Pat Kennedy worked on the railroads as well. So there were
                    times I would climb on board one - he worked for the city though - I'd climb on
                    board, I guess it was the Independent, and I'd always look to see who the
                    motorman was, to see if it might be my Uncle Pat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned your friend who died when she was 17.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Helen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was that a traumatic experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HEALY: It was rather. It was rather. Helen was a very popular girl and the
                    brightest in my grammar school class. She was an only child. She became very
                    close to my family and her parents both worked, so Helen was, I guess, in these
                    days we'd call her a latchkey child, although in those days it was fairly
                    uncommon to have a child whose parents were both out at work. So Helen would
                    frequently come down, we only lived a block away. We'd come down to my place
                    after supper. I don't know what she did for supper. In any event we were fairly
                    close. I guess she developed a heart problem in sixth grade and was in Bellevue
                    - was it Bellevue - no, King's County Hospital for about some months before they
                    moved her out to St. Francis sanatorium for cardiac children in Rosslyn. It's
                    still a famous children's hospital. I think today she could easily have been
                    cured with an operation. In those days they just put them to bed and did the
                    best they could for them. So I was corresponding with Helen, visited her once or
                    twice, helped the Bonds with fund drives for St. Francis. And I remember it was
                    quite a shock when she did die.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been. Did you belong to Girl Scouts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, we had no Girl Scouts in the neighborhood. I once traveled all the way
                    to my Aunt Bridget's parish, St. Theresa's in Flatbush, to try to join the Girl
                    Scouts, but they said they only took girls from the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, dear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, there was nothing in the neighborhood. My sister and I did belong for
                    a year or two to something called the Girl Cadets of OLPM, with little uniforms
                    and marching and things like that. But we lost interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Just that. Girl Cadets. It was a sort of a girls' group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Somebody had organized.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Somebody had organized it, right. Childhood illnesses, none, thank God.
                    Illness or early death of a sibling, no, thank God.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Early ambitions, expectations of parents. As I say, my parents expected us to be
                    good, expected us to do what we were supposed to do in school. I do not remember
                    any particular push to get A's, but that may have been because we got A's. I
                    think there would not have been that kind of push. It was a matter of, “Go to
                    school, do what your teacher tells you to do,” and that's it. So as long as
                    there was no complaint from school, they would have accepted A's or B's or
                    probably even C's on the understanding that you were doing your best. I don't
                    recollect any pressures to be anything either. It was a matter of be a good
                    Catholic, be a good student, be a good person, and then life comes,” that's
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of the nuns inspire you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oddly enough, no. I had some very good teachers, of course, very good,
                    particularly in high school, because, as I've said, Bishop McDonnell was a
                    diocesan high school and it was therefore staffed, not by one order of nuns as
                    the elementary schools, but by five orders of nuns. We understood there was a
                    good deal of competition for each order of nuns to put their best teachers in
                    Bishop McDonnell, a matter of holding up your order in front of all the other
                    orders. So our feeling was, we did have excellent teachers at Bishop's. I was
                    rather shy, and I don't recollect striking up any particularly close
                    relationship with any of my teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you had an early interest in history, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I enjoyed all of my courses in grammar school. I just enjoyed learning. I
                    enjoyed school. In high school, the same thing happened. I enjoyed all the
                    classes. I didn't have to have a major, I just followed the curriculum set out
                    by the school. Those girls who had the best marks in first year Latin formed
                    part of what was called the French group. Out of the three hundred or so
                    students, perhaps forty were selected for the French group, and they were the
                    ones who followed the strictest academic program, which meant you started your
                    second language in sophomore year rather than third year, and it also meant that
                    you took three years math. In my case, it was a choice of a third year of
                    science, chemistry, or a fourth year of Latin. I decided I'd rather have
                    chemistry than a fourth year of Latin.Now let's see, where are we. Up to early
                    ambitions, expectations of parents: As I say, I felt very little pressure from
                    my parents.</p>
                <p>Hobbies. I really had very little in the way of hobbies except reading. It was
                    the most important thing in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a library card, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HEALY: Early on, when I was about seven. I don't remember learning how to read. I
                    think I learned from my sister. I have a vivid memory of my sister's first day
                    at school. She came home with a homework lesson to write a page of A's. I can
                    remember my sister writing some A's, and my father writing some A's, and my
                    mother writing some A's, my Uncle Pat writing some A's, and I wrote some
                    A's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How sweet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: So, as far as I can recollect, what my sister learned, I learned almost
                    the same day. But I do recollect at some point finding out that... Somebody had
                    a book, and I remember because we were talking about this, oddly enough, with
                    somebody this weekend. It was a book called “The Chinese Twins.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, the twin books, weren't they marvelous?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I said, “Where did you get this book?” and whoever the child was, the
                    answer was, “The public library.” So I can remember trailing down to the public
                    library and asking to have some books, and they sent me back home to get a gas
                    bill or a light bill showing my address. Back I went to the library and they
                    said, “Can you read?” and I said, “Yes.” I had to go to the children's librarian
                    and read a whole page of instructions about how I had to treat the books, and
                    what the rules were. When I answered all the questions, they gave me a library
                    card and I never looked back. I was down there about three times a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been very proud when you got that card.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, I didn't know enough to be proud or not proud. All I knew was that
                    card was the entr�e to the books, and I loved it. I loved it. In fact, it was so
                    noticeable that my mother, in particular, became concerned, and by the time I
                    got to be about thirteen, she was trying to throw me out of the house in the
                    summertime to do other things than read. But I was perfectly content to spend
                    every spare moment reading. So hobbies, apart from that, there were very few
                    opportunities, really, to develop hobbies in Brooklyn in those days. I swam in
                    the public swimming pool up at Sunset Park and I would roller skate on the
                    street or roller skate with friends at an indoor skating rink. That's about it
                    really, street games, sleigh ride down the street when the snow came, that kind
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about movies? Did you go to the movies on
                        Saturdays?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, regularly. Every child got ten cents for the movie and a penny for
                    candy and we'd go off to the Sunset theater, I guess it was called, for whatever
                    was showing. I rather enjoyed it. We'd see a double feature and cartoons and the
                    Movietone news and I always enjoyed it. That was, by the way, when I decided
                    what two sports I would pursue if I ever had the opportunity: tennis and skiing,
                    because the Movietone news would show, regularly, a few clips on different
                    sports and I decided tennis and skiing were very nice sports. It was years, of
                    course, before I had a chance to do anything about that.</p>
                <p>And was very happy to discover that my... When I think of it now, those people in
                    the public library knew exactly what I was doing. I couldn't possibly have
                    fooled them. But when my sister started high school she was entitled to an adult
                    card at the library, and I asked her if I could use it. Of course, my sister
                    said yes. So I then proceeded, brazen-faced, to go down to the public library
                    where I was well-known for six or seven years and pull out this adult card
                    [laughter]. When I think of it now, I think they must have known what I was
                    doing. But, of course, they never said anything and this gave me access to books
                    such as Sherlock Holmes, if you can believe it. I'm sure Sherlock Holmes is in
                    the children's section these days, but it wasn't in those days, it was in the
                    adult section. And access to science fiction books. I discovered a whole new
                    world there. Of course in those days, a whole new world of adult fiction is not
                    the same thing as a whole new world of adult fiction today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: And I wouldn't be surprised if the public libraries didn't have three
                    sections, a children's section, an adult section, and a dirty books section.</p>
                <p>Friendships: I was a fairly shy girl and did not make many friendships. Certainly
                    not in high school. It was only in college that I began forming friendships that
                    have lasted. Although once again, there it was a matter of spending a lot of
                    time working and a lot of time in college and not having the kind of free time
                    that permits the development of deep friendships. But as I say, I do still have
                    a handful of people I see from those days.</p>
                <p>Solitary occupations: I guess I've already said it, I read until the books were
                    coming out my ears.</p>
                <p>Organizations: There were no organizations in grammar school except the honor
                    society, which didn't count.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The orchestra in high school.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>HEALY: The orchestra in high school. I belonged to a service organization called
                    Anthonian Hall for a couple of years there. I went to the blind home up near
                    Bishop Laughlin and helped Daisy and Dora. I'd read to them or write letters for
                    them or run out to the store for them, that kind of thing, once a week. I
                    haven't really put my mind to that kind of thing. Let see, what else did I do in
                    high school? Well, there was the orchestra, there was Anthonian Hall. I guess
                    that was probably about it in high school, because, once again, the minute I
                    turned sixteen I was working, as did most of the girls at Bishop's. And apart
                    from the Glee Club and the orchestra and the dramatic society, I don't recollect
                    any strong push or pull on the part of organizations, except somehow or another
                    I ended up in this Anthonian Guild Society dedicated to service to the people at
                    the blind home.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Through high school. One of the nuns was interested and I remember she
                    recruited a group of us and I was one of them. As I say, I stayed with it until
                    I found that it was a bit too much for me, once I started working.</p>

                    because it took two afternoons a week, took all my spare time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Team sports: None in high school. In fact sports were not emphasized in a
                    girls catholic high school in those days. And individual sports: There was not
                    time for anything like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, were you in high school, no you wouldn't be in high
                        school yet when the war was on, would you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, I started high school in September '46.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it didn't make too much of an impact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, and fortunately, thank God, in my family we've always been the wrong
                    year for the world wars. My father was just 18 when the [first world war ended
                    and he turned 40 just before the second world war. Of course, my generation was
                    too young for the second world war, and Korea would have caught one of my
                    brothers except for the fact that he was... Actually he was born in '34, '44,
                    '54 the Korean war was over before he got out of college. And besides he was
                    overweight, severely, and then developed diabetes as well. Anyway, in college I
                    was much more active, the Blood Bank, the college newspaper. I think I did
                    something on the high school newspaper, contributions, but it was not very much.
                    In college I did, the college newspaper, the college yearbook - I was editor of
                    the college yearbook - the French club, debating - I did debate in my last year
                    or two - the social club. Again, St. John's teacher's college, because it was
                    basically afternoon, evening, and Saturday because most of the students worked
                    more or less full time, there was not a strong emphasis on these
                    extra-curricular activities because nobody had the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, of course not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: There was a girls' basketball team, but I wasn't interested in sports. My
                    eyes were bad. I'd started wearing eyeglasses when I was about eight or nine.
                    And there wasn't much time for anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work after school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: In high school, yes, after school and in summers. Everybody lied about
                    their age. My mother would sign little notes saying I was 18 when I was only 16.
                    Then at St. John's I had a freshman scholarship for the first year, and only
                    worked part time in one of the department stores. But once the freshman
                    scholarship ran out, I transferred from the day college to the afternoon
                    college, the teacher's college, and that was when I started teaching myself. The
                    catholic grammar schools in the New York City area were booming and they needed
                    school teachers. I guess there weren't enough nuns. But many of the college
                    students, the young women at St. John's Teacher's College had jobs teaching at
                    catholic elementary schools. (End of tape)</p>
                <p>As I say, I took the foreign service examination September of '54. That was the
                    last time they gave the four-day exam, but those four days happened to coincide
                    with the first four days of the elementary school year.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: So I had not been able to apply for a job as a school teacher until I took
                    the examination, then four days late I started trying to locate a teaching job.
                    Once again, I was fortunate in that my sister, who had graduated a year earlier,
                    had a teaching job at P.S. 11 in Bedford Stuyvesant. About four weeks into the
                    school year, once again, Maureen came home and said, “Miss McNealy needs a
                    school teacher for the third grade.” Maureen was teaching first or second, I
                    think. “If you're interested why don't you go down and talk to her.” So down I
                    went to see Miss McNealy, a very old-fashioned teacher who believed in
                    discipline, and that's how I landed my job teaching at P.S. 11 for that one year
                    before I joined the Foreign Service.The school was an old school. It had been
                    built before President Lincoln visited it. It didn't have corridors, it had
                    sliding doors, so that each room opened into everybody else's room. It was quite
                    an old plant. But it was a good year, because Miss McNealy had been there as a
                    school teacher and principal for something like thirty years. While it was
                    Bedford Stuyvesant and a black neighborhood, Miss McNealy ran that school with
                    an iron hand and the discipline was excellent. And of course, I had had the
                    experience of three years of teaching. So I was not the usual innocent college
                    graduate thrown into her first classroom. I had no trouble with the children,
                    and in fact enjoyed it very much. It was in May of that year, '55, that I came
                    down to Washington for the oral, passed it and started training in September of
                    '55 for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>That carries us up through what? [Reading] scholastic abilities, subjects
                    enjoyed: I enjoyed everything. History was my best subject, so I majored in it.
                    I still love history.</p>
                <p>Influential teachers: In college, Professor Williams was excellent. In fact, all
                    my teachers in the history department were excellent and added to the
                    stimulation of the courses and confirmed me in my own desires to do something
                    with international affairs or something on that order.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that you took a course your second year on
                        diplomatic history and that's when you became interested in the Foreign
                        Service. Did your teacher push that in any way? Or was that strictly your
                        own idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not at all. In fact the chapter describing in Foreign Service as a career
                    wasn't even assigned reading. But of course with hours on the subway I
                    frequently would read things not required and I was leafing through he book and
                    came across that chapter, read it, and decided that sounded like an interesting
                    career.</p>
                <p>I didn't know much about the Foreign Service. I certainly didn't know anything
                    about the difficulty of getting in. I didn't know anything about the mystique of
                    elitism. I had barely made a connection between Senator McCarthy and this career
                    I'd read about in my text book.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true, you missed all that McCarthy stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes, that was in the early fifties. Extra curricular activities, I've
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Impact of World War II: The only thing I can say about the impact of World War II
                    was minimal on me because I was so young. But I remember the Korean War because
                    in the early fifties, the male graduates, of course, knew that they'd be swept
                    up in the draft the minute they were graduated and I was very much aware of
                    this. I remember that when I was twenty or twenty-one, no I couldn't have been
                    that old because I was a freshman at St. John's, so I must have been nineteen.
                    And I guess I had to have my mother's permission again, but I went down to the
                    Red Cross to give blood and they wouldn't take me because I didn't have enough
                    iron in my blood. The next time a blood bank came and all of this was my one
                    contribution to feeling that they should be requiring something of me, instead
                    of just of the young men. But finally, when I had another opportunity to give
                    blood I smartened up and started taking iron pills. From then on I've become a
                    dedicated blood donor, and in fact I'm up to about eight or nine gallons at this
                    stage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, right now they won't take my blood because of the West African
                    experience, except for research. When I discovered through the Foreign Service
                    Journal that the Red Cross was looking for people like me who had been on
                    malaria pills and couldn't donate for regular use, they were looking for people
                    like me for research, I started going back down. In fact I'm going on Thursday
                    to give a pint of blood. I think basically they just use the research blood for
                    testing for shelf life and things like that. They don't want to waste good blood
                    for that. Another year and I'll be able to give blood regularly again.</p>
                <p>Military service: Wasn't involved.</p>
                <p>Red Cross work: I was involved in both high school and for my first year in
                    college in civil defense. I went down to the local police station when I was
                    about sixteen and offered to do whatever needed doing, so I was sort of a
                    volunteer clerical help at the police station for civil defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any boyfriends go off to the Korean War?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HEALY: No, a boyfriend was drafted, but by this time it was '53, and while Al was
                    drafted, they put him into cook's school which was a total waste of a fine mind.
                    But they finally realized that turning him into a cook was not the thing to do,
                    and they made him something in the education line. But that's as close as the
                    war ever came.</p>
                <p>First interest in the Foreign Service, I've mentioned.</p>
                <p>Special preparations for the Foreign Service was zero. Mostly because, once
                    again, I did not realize what was involved. I simply read about the career,
                    noticed the advertisement for the exam, took the exam. My first realization of
                    what was involved came during the four days I was taking the exam, because as we
                    finished one test I'd chit chat in the corridors with the others who were there
                    at the Federal Center on Christopher Street, [and] from the comments of the
                    other students who were a little bit more sophisticated than I - It's not very
                    difficult to be more sophisticated than I. They were coming from Columbia. I
                    remember one young man was there from Harvard - that was when I first understood
                    that I wasn't really expected to pass the written, and they were telling me that
                    there was a cram course in Georgetown in Washington. So I was making alternate
                    plans. I thought I'd teach this year and save my money, take this summer cram
                    course next summer, and take the test a second time, and then if I don't pass
                    it, that would be the end of it. I did pass it the first time, though.</p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it three days of exam and one of language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Three and a half. It was three and a half days. The half day was not just
                    the language exam. It seems to me there were two exams that morning, but I can't
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, because they kept changing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: This was the exam that had been given since '46. '46 to '54 was the four
                    day, three and a half day exam. Then they shortened it to one day. I'm not quite
                    certain what was involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you took the oral?</hi>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HEALY: Down here in Washington. They only gave the oral in Washington in those
                    days. I came down. I had to take two days off from my teaching job. I told Miss
                    McNealy what it was all about, because the only other way you managed to have a
                    day off from school is to pretend to be sick. School teachers have got to show
                    up for work. But I told her what was happening, and I came down to Washington,
                    took the oral.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, that would be 1955?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes. May of 1955.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. They were still giving the exams the same old

                <p>HEALY: I guess.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently, obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: There were five men who gave me an oral examination. One of them was
                    Outerbridge Horsey, I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Outerbridge Horsey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: He was on my panel. One of them was a man from Commerce whose name was Mr.
                    Rennet. I remember his name only because when they introduced me they had
                    forgotten his name and had to ask him for his name so they could introduce him
                    to me. But I don't remember the other three.</p>
                <p>I was told immediately that I'd passed the oral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good for you.</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HEALY: I was then told to go back home and wait to hear from them. And in fact,
                    they called me up almost immediately and asked me to join a June or July class.
                    I explained I'd signed up... I was taking graduate credits at Hunter. I told
                    them that I'd signed up for summer school and would prefer to wait until I'd
                    finished my courses, my two courses at summer school. That was why I was asked
                    to report at the end of September of '55.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking at summer school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I was taking a course in American diplomatic history, again, at the
                    graduate level, and a course in US-European relations, as I recollect. I had
                    taken two other graduate courses in the fall semester. Then I gave myself a
                    spring semester off, and then I took two more graduate courses at Hunter that
                    summer. As I recollect I also had a summer job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My word, but you were a worker.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It was the way we all lived in those days. It was a very nice little job.
                    I worked from two until ten at the Carroll Club, a women's Catholic business
                    women's club on Park Avenue or Madison Avenue. It was in an old mansion. They
                    had a swimming pool in the basement. Rita Sylvester was in charge. I just helped
                    out at the desk, I remember. Maybe it was from two to eight, or two to ten, I've
                    forgotten. Well, anyway, it was a very easy little job and the money was good
                    and it was quite amusing.</p>

                <p>HEALY: That was the summer of '55 when I was going to Hunter for these graduate
                    credits, the two courses. I think I only went two or three mornings during the
                    week, then I had this afternoon and evening job. That brings us up to beginning
                    career.</p>

                <p>We had reached the point where you were just about to embark upon your Foreign

                        months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, oddly enough, this is almost exactly thirty years ago, and I've
                    spent a few minutes this morning trying to get in touch with some of my former
                    classmates. The Foreign Service Institute had just been, as I recollect, charged
                    with a stronger mandate to train junior officers. I know that when Washington
                    telephoned, initially they wanted me to join the, what they call the August
                    class, I guess it was, which would have been the second class in this new format
                    of training for junior officers, a three-month training. But I couldn't do it
                    because I had signed up already for these graduate courses and I had a job and I
                    said, “I won't be able to, would September or October be all right?” I was told
                    yes, I could join the third junior foreign service officer class which would be
                    formed at the end of September, and, in fact, I reported for duty in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>My family wasn't terribly keen on this business of leaving home. Nobody had ever
                    done it before. I promised to keep in touch very carefully and my mother was
                    placated by the fact that I had signed up to live as a resident in some small
                    Catholic residential hall for young business women near the Capitol. I got out
                    of there after a day or two, because the regulations were really very
                    restrictive. And it was awkwardly placed for the Department of State. I followed
                    the good example of some of my bachelor classmates and I moved up to the old
                    McLean Gardens, where a lot of junior foreign service officers ended up for
                    their temporary time in Washington.We were sworn in on the 28th of September,
                    most of us from that class and we began our training at FSI. I enjoyed it very
                    much. It was then I received my first indoctrination, I guess is the word, in
                    really what the Foreign Service is all about and what foreign service officers
                    are all about. I remember being struck by the fact that if I looked around the
                    classroom at my colleagues, they did not all seem to be straight out of the Ivy
                    League, Harvard, Princeton, Yale mold from wealthy backgrounds. They looked just
                    about as ordinary as I'm sure I looked and I've kept in touch with them off and
                    on all this time. As I say, almost every year with some exceptions, we manage to
                    get together for dinner toward the end of September. This year we will be
                    celebrating our 30th anniversary.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>There were two other young women in the class. Nancy Snyder left after four or
                    five years to take her master's degree and her Ph.D. and she became an academic.
                    Jay Gillespie had a rather unfortunate history. Jay became very caught up in
                    what was then the Algerian struggle for independence from France. After her
                    first assignment in Washington of two years, she informed the department that
                    the only assignment she would take overseas would be to Algeria. The department
                    apparently - all of this is hearsay and third hand - had become aware of the
                    fact that she was getting much too close to local groups, which apparently
                    existed even in Washington, promoting freedom for Algeria and refused to send
                    her to this part of the world. At this point she quit, obtained correspondence
                    credentials from a relative who ran a New England newspaper, went down to
                    Africa, and the next thing I heard, she was jailed by the French, picked up
                    hepatitis and died. Very dramatic story. I really don't know the truth of it
                    because all of this was picked up a bit here and a bit there over the years from
                    people who, I'm sure, didn't know the truth of the whole story either.</p>
                <p>The rest of us in the class had the usual sorts of assignments. I remember that
                    about half-way through the first two months we had to fill out a form, and of
                    course we were told it was called the April Fool report, which is part of
                    foreign service tradition, naming places we would like to be assigned to. I just
                    thought let's not invite disaster, and I remember putting down number 1 Europe,
                    number 2 the Far East, and number 3 Latin America, I think. So I thought surely
                    they'll be able to find something for me in that selection. And I was very
                    pleased when I was told I was being assigned to Naples, Italy as a refugee
                    relief officer. I didn't know at all what this meant, but Italy sounded
                    delightful. It was Europe, my first choice. I didn't think my parents would be
                    as shaken by an assignment to Italy as one to... I remember one of the young men
                    went to a place we had never even heard of, Medellin, Colombia.</p>
                <p>Then the last month of the three-month training was devoted to language. This was
                    before the Foreign Service Institute had really geared up its language school to
                    the point where we find it today. I felt myself lucky to get four hours a day
                    for four weeks of Italian. I loved learning the language. I just thought it was
                    great fun. I hadn't realized that, but apparently I do have a talent for
                    learning languages.</p>
                <p>Then I did everything that the little instruction sheet said I should do,
                    including arranging to take a ship to Europe, and notified my family that
                    shortly after the New Year, I would be climbing on board a ship going to Italy.
                    I think from what my sister has told me over the years, my parents were really a
                    bit shaken up by all this. In retrospect, I marvel that I, after having never,
                    never, never left Brooklyn in my life, I could face with equanimity this whole
                    idea going off on a ship to Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's amazing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>HEALY: It amazes me now, but nevertheless, I climbed on board the ship with the
                    whole family in tow and we drank champagne in my tiny, tiny, little four-bunk
                    cabin. That was it, they climbed off the ship and off I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What ship were you on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I was on the Constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That went to Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It went to Naples via Barcelona and Genoa. There were two other people
                    from my class on the ship with me. One was proceeding on route by car to Palermo
                    and one had been assigned to Naples with me. I enjoyed the ship tremendously.
                    This was my idea of the foreign service life. Here I was in first class on board
                    a ship crossing the Atlantic and all at somebody else's expense, too.</p>
                <p>And I was also very fortunate to have met a young man who had just finished a
                    year taking a master's degree at Brooklyn Polytech, which was a graduate
                    engineering school in Brooklyn, New York. GG had taken his bachelor's degree at
                    the University of Naples and was returning to his family in Naples to eventually
                    take a Ph.D. in what I seem to recollect was aeronautical engineering, but which
                    turns out, from something I read in the paper this past year about him, to
                    involve the Italian space effort, because he was over here for one of the
                    launchings, which involved the Italian government in some way, or the European
                    space agency or whatever. So it was quite amusing to run across his name again.
                    I'm sure there could only be one Dr. Luigi Napolitano from Naples, Italy,
                    involved in something like this.</p>
                <p>Anyway, GG did introduce me to his parents and his sisters and through them I
                    came to know a group of young Italians and sopped up Italian just as fast as I
                    could hear it spoken, which was a big help to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had already known French, had you, at university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh-ho-ho, I had had high school French and I had had college French, which
                    doesn't teach you to speak two words of it. In fact I had failed when I first
                    took the foreign service exam. the only one of the many tests we took you were
                    allowed to fail was the language test. I failed it. Fortunately during that
                    training period in Washington, I was able to take the French test again and
                    squeak through. So theoretically I was not a language probationer, but I didn't
                    consider that I spoke French. But Italian was my first spoken foreign
                    language.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I enjoyed the work although it seemed rather pointless to me. An Italian clerk
                    went through a refugee's file and certified it for final clearance, turned it
                    over to me. I proceeded to do exactly the same thing and certified it for final
                    clearance. Then Alice Griffith, who headed up the section, would put her final
                    chalk on it as ready for final clearance. Since I had been a school teacher for
                    four years, I thought this was rather stupid clerical work, but I thought, well,
                    they say in the beginning junior officers have pretty pointless tasks.</p>
                <p>After about four or five months, the refugee relief program was winding down. We
                    had dozens of people in Germany, Italy, Greece, I think, still handling war
                    refugees, but refugees from natural disasters, like earthquakes and floods. But
                    we were running down on the legislation that permitted us to bring these people
                    into the United States as refugees.</p>
                <p>By the end of that first year, I had been transferred to the main building via a
                    very disagreeable two or three weeks of sorting out dirty old files. That was
                    when I first noticed that the young men got to be special assistants to the
                    consul general and the young women got to clean out the dirty old files. But
                    eventually I was transferred down to the main building and placed in charge
                    of... Well, I was the initial officer who made the initial decision on
                    non-immigrant visas. And the rule, of course, in Naples for non-immigrant visas
                    was, you don't give anyone a visitor's visa unless he happens to be the mayor of
                    the city or somebody else whose bone fides are absolutely unquestionable.</p>
                <p>But I enjoyed the work. And there was an exciting time when we had some American
                    refugees from troubles, I guess it would have been in the Suez Canal area,
                    leaving the Middle East via US Army troop ships. A group of us from Naples were
                    flown down to Sicily and boarded the General Patton in the middle of the Straits
                    of Messina in the middle of the night. I thought that was really very exciting.
                    This was what I joined the Foreign Service for. Even if the actual work was
                    simply processing passports and assigning people to hotel rooms, it was still
                    nevertheless, pretty exciting.</p>
                <p>By the time I got back from a short weekend in Rome in October, I had learned two
                    things, which came as a bit of a surprise. First of all, we were a losing a
                    number of positions in Naples and I was being transferred to Milan. That didn't
                    trouble me too much, it was still Italy - One poor young man was transferred
                    from Naples to Venezuela, as I recollect - but that before I could be
                    transferred to Milan, my useful services, my warm body, my useful pair of hands
                    were needed in Vienna because we had the Hungarian revolution and we had
                    refugees pouring out of Hungary into Vienna. So, I just went up to Vienna and
                    spent four weeks up there trying to help many others, pulled in from other
                    places in Europe, deal with this flood of refugees. Got back to Naples in time
                    to spend Christmas in a friend's apartment and then started the drive up to
                    Milan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had your own car?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, yes. First thing I did when I landed in Naples was buy a Volkswagen, a
                    brand new Volkswagen. I don't think it could have cost more than $500. We had
                    all been trained properly in foreign service procedures. Before we left
                    Washington, we had all borrowed money from the credit union, so I had money to
                    buy my Volkswagen.</p>
                <p>I drove up to Milan where I spent the next three years with home leave after one
                    year and a return for two more years. I loved that assignment. I loved the
                    people. Bill Boswell was my first consul general, Charlie Rogers my second, Sam
                    Gammon was there, Parker Wyman. Harold Swope, and, of course, all my Italian
                    friends on the staff of the consulate. When I was over in Milan just two months
                    ago, I had a very happy time speaking to Maria Lousia on the telephone. She's
                    retired and was living in Parma. And having dinner with Laurie... So the ties I
                    developed in Milan are probably the strongest.</p>
                <p>The first year I was there I did general consular work, and I enjoyed that very
                    much because it was a bit of everything. It was citizenship, passports, visa
                    work, protection and welfare, which was fascinating. I came in contact with such
                    people as the Princess della Torre e Taxis who wanted to sound out the consul
                    general for ideas on what she should do with her villa up in Bellagio. As it
                    turned out she decided to leave it to the Rockefeller Foundation. J. Paul Getty
                    came in to sign his will and I discovered when he died a few years back that
                    that will was the will that survived all these years. I had to deal with poor
                    Americans who lost all their money, one poor woman whose mental balance was
                    impaired. It was just great fun. I enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>Then I went on home leave, saw my family, and when I left to come back to Italy,
                    I think I was very much in the balance as between do I really want to do this
                    again? Probably if I hadn't enjoyed Milan so much, the risk there was I would
                    have said, “I don't want to do this any more, I want to stay home with the
                    family.” But I loved Milan, so I was able to, with much weeping and wailing,
                    climb on board my first - it wasn't my first airplane, but it was my first long
                    commercial - journey from New York to Boston to Ireland, where I visited my
                    Irish relatives for the very first time ever, to London, and so on back to
                    Milan. That was a very, very enjoyable trip.</p>
                <p>I had two more years in Milan, this time as administrative officer, and I very
                    much enjoyed that too. It was just a great deal of fun. I guess I'm leaving out
                    the one month when I was sent down to Genoa, because Genoa needed help in
                    closing out its refugee relief program. Genoa never told Rome or Bill Boswell in
                    Milan that my services were needed to clean out their dirty old files.These were
                    the things that really soured me on the Foreign Service. But then something good
                    would come along, you see. I know I never told Bill Boswell, because I did tell
                    Sam and Mary Gammon, and Sam said, “If Bill Boswell knew that that's why he had
                    to send you down to Genoa for four weeks, he'd have blown his stack.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>But at the end of the two years in Milan I asked for a Washington assignment. I
                    thought, “Four years is enough. Now I want to go back home and be able to see
                    the family all the time.” My sister was married before I joined the Foreign
                    Service and by 1960 she had three children and I wanted to see them, and my
                    brother was getting married shortly after I got back from Italy.</p>
                <p>So I was assigned to be one of the assistants on the Italian desk in the Bureau
                    of European Affairs. This was a political job, a political assignment in the
                    sense of doing political work, which I was pleased about because I had picked up
                    the mystique in the Foreign Service about admin work and consular work, and I
                    had learned to conceal the fact that I quite enjoyed doing both those jobs in
                    Milan. But I was pleased to be doing what amounted to political reporting as
                    assistant on the Italian desk. My language was good, my knowledge of Italian
                    political affairs was pretty scanty, despite my years of living there, but I
                    learned a great deal. That's where I met Ed Williams. He was the other
                    assistant.</p>
                <p>Well, again we were going through reductions in force and they abolished both the
                    assistant positions on the Italian desk. I remember thinking, “Well, now
                    what?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, about a year, slightly less. I started working in July of 1960. This
                    would have been about March or April of '61, because President Kennedy, newly in
                    office, had just announced the formation of the Peace Corps, and the circular
                    had come around the Department of State calling for foreign service officers to
                    volunteer for duty with the Peace Corps, helping organize it. I was thinking to
                    myself, “That could be pretty interesting.” and my hand was on the telephone
                    when Galen Stone walked into the office and asked me would I want to be the
                    Swiss desk officer. Well, I thought that sounded fine. I liked the people I was
                    working with very much. I admired the capabilities of the people I worked with.
                    They were all top notch people, Bill Blue, Bob McBride, Sam Lewis, Sam Gammon,
                    Frank Meloy who died, of course, in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I knew Frank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It was a very nice office. Western European Affairs it was called. So I
                    said, “Yes, I would like to be the Swiss desk officer.” I was the Swiss desk
                    officer for the next year and a half approximately, learning a good bit about
                    Switzerland, becoming fairly involved in the Cuban missile crisis, involved at a
                    very, very low level - I was a spear carrier - but involved because the Swiss
                    represented our interests in Cuba, so whenever a note, a formal note had to go
                    to Cuba, I would hand-carry it up to the Swiss embassy. Believe me, these were
                    the unimportant things. The important stuff was being handled out of the
                    operations center by the White House, orally, not by sending formal diplomatic
                    notes. That was just a tidying up operation, but it meant I felt involved and I
                    enjoyed it very much.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Then, of course, the question of a foreign assignment came up again and I
                    indicated an interest in going to eastern Europe. I was told that women officers
                    didn't go to eastern Europe in those days. I said, “Secretaries go why don't
                    women officers?” “Well, it's just not done.” But I persisted and I was assigned
                    to Hungarian language training along with another officer, but then we were both
                    canceled out of the language training and I was left high and dry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the other officer a man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: He was canceled out as well. The two people we were supposed to replace a
                    year later extended for a year, so there would be no Hungarian language training
                    that year. At that point one of the natural developments occurred that kept me
                    in European affairs for the first fifteen years of my career. The political
                    officer in Switzerland was leaving, would I want to be the political officer in
                    Switzerland? It was a natural result of the work I'd been doing in Washington,
                    and I felt, “Why not.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's how you got into political cone work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, I was doing political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's true, but I mean but you just sort of slid into it
                        from having done consular and admin, you just sort of slid into that, which
                        is so highly prized by all</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That was being assistant on the Italian desk. The three years in
                    Washington were political work. I was in the political cone. So a political
                    assignment overseas was natural.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Did they call them cones at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HEALY: I don't know that they did. I think they just said political work,
                    political specialty, something like that. But since I had been doing political
                    work for three years, to go abroad as a political office was a natural result,
                    and to go to Switzerland was again a natural result, particularly because I had
                    been taking French language training, I think in the early morning, and German
                    language training in the early morning. So in January, '64 I arrived in
                    Switzerland for a very, very enjoyable and interesting three years as political
                    officer there. I enjoyed my colleagues, I enjoyed my work very much, I enjoyed
                    my living conditions, I enjoyed Bern very much. I had a wonderful tennis club
                    with very, very warm and friendly people. I still keep up with Beatrice and her
                    brother, Rudy, who were tennis playing partners. Beatrice and I did very well
                    playing interclub for the Sporting Tennis club. I can't think of anything
                    unusual that happened during those three years. I did go home once in the three
                    years but it was not home leave, I had to pay to get myself home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your living arrangements, Terry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I found an apartment. I had bought furniture back in '58, a few sticks. My
                    apartments were undoubtedly very sparsely furnished. A couch, a chair, a table,
                    one of each, kind of thing. But I did have enough furniture to take an
                    unfurnished apartment. I was fortunate that the people who had the apartment
                    before me were, I guess, Italians, and they had an Italian maid who was living
                    in the maid's quarters in the basement of this three-story apartment building.
                    And Elvira agreed to stay on and wanted very much to stay on, and could only
                    stay on if I hired her. Elvira took care of the house for me on a part-time
                    basis and worked elsewhere, I think in a factory. So I was very comfortable
                    there and enjoyed it very much. The tennis was excellent, the skiing was
                    excellent.</p>
                <p>Then of course it came time to consider where I would go from there. It was '66
                    and everybody, it seemed, was concerned about what was going on in Vietnam. I
                    thought a Vietnam assignment would be useful and fascinating and it was the
                    thing to do at the time. I was not in Washington, I didn't thoroughly
                    understand, I think, all the ins and outs, but I did write to the department and
                    say I would be interested in going to Vietnam on assignment. Back came an answer
                    saying, “We think that Saigon is a good likely possibility, in fact we have a
                    job identified for you via six months in the economic training class, which had
                    just been organized at FSI. I think I was in the third intensive economic
                    training course.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I was very pleased to do this because after three years in Bern, I was beginning
                    to realize just how important economics is. The economic section was twice the
                    size of the political section. The intertwining of those two subjects in Bern is
                    perhaps more common these days than back in the mid-sixties, but I remember
                    thinking to myself, “I would be a more valuable political officer if I knew
                    something about economics.” So when they offered this, I thought, “Fine, I'll
                    learn economics, I'll be at home for six full months and have a chance to see
                    the family a lot before I go off to Saigon.” I just thought this was working out
                    very well indeed. I came back to Washington. The six months intensive economic
                    training was very difficult. I don't think I have a flair for economics. I
                    worked hard at it, though, and did very well in it.</p>
                <p>The thing that was most disappointing is that the assignment to Saigon fell
                    through, and fell through, I am convinced, because a woman was not wanted in the
                    job. I have no proof of this, but from comments made to me by an acquaintance,
                    comments which I still remember, to the effect that there are two female
                    officers in Saigon and Saigon thinks it has its quota, it doesn't want another
                    woman. The official reason given, after a very painful interview with some
                    political appointee over at the Executive Office Building, was that I didn't
                    have the economic experience to deal with the job. Well, I thought that was a
                    sham.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little late in the day to be using that as an
                        excuse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, there was a little conversation that went on there between my
                    acquaintance and the man who was going out to head the economic section, to the
                    effect of, “Why didn't you tell me sooner that this assignment had been made?
                    And my acquaintance responded, “I only found out about it last month when I
                    visited Saigon.” Which also led me to what, I think, was a very sound conclusion
                    that discrimination played a part in that.</p>
                <p>I was very hurt. I didn't know what to do, but at this point I'm afraid I
                    decided, “if I'm not going to go to Saigon, I'm not going overseas at all. I
                    want a Washington assignment”. My pride was badly hurt because I thought I could
                    have handled it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I was very annoyed that people would think that I had tried to get out of
                    the Saigon assignment through fear or...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you had that to contend with as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HEALY: Well, I don't know. But here I'd been telling everyone I was going to go
                    to Vietnam and all of a sudden I'm not going. The question: “Why is Terry not
                    going to Vietnam.” Answer: “Maybe she's afraid of the danger.” So all in all
                    this was a very unpleasant summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should think so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Lightened by one fact. I was assigned to a job that was very, very useful
                    to me. It doesn't sound glamorous. It was Washington, as I had requested, and it
                    was to INR, a research job on European common market and economic organization
                    affairs. I learned a great deal in that job. I enjoyed working for Anton De
                    Porte who came into the Foreign Service with me but was also my boss at the
                    time. I learned a lot from Anton. It was a very, very useful and valuable
                    assignment. I remember thinking at the time that I couldn't stand it because my
                    previous Washington experience had been in one of the geographic bureaus where
                    the phones were ringing all the time and somebody was calling up, and in INR
                    it's a cloister. Perhaps not so much now, but in those days it was. So when RPE,
                    which is the European action counterpart to the research work that I was doing,
                    suggested I come down to the Bureau of European Affairs and work in the action
                    office, I was very happy to do so. I spent three very happy years there, doing
                    more or less the same work, except in the action side rather than the research
                    side.So I had five years in Washington that I enjoyed very much indeed. I had a
                    chance to come to know something about the department, to learn something about
                    issues such as unionization, and whether AFSA should become a union. I never got
                    involved for some reason, possibly because I was so taken up with the
                    unionization issue, I never got involved in the women's discrimination issue,
                    which was becoming public knowledge in '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Yes, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I was in Washington from '67 to '72, and yet my only involvement in those
                    issues... It must have been peripheral if it existed at all. I would read about
                    the Allison Palmer case in the newspaper, but somehow or other, my spare time
                    energies were devoted to tennis, to skiing, and to turning the Foreign Service
                    Association into a union. But those were very happy years in Washington, as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how did you feel about your promotion schedule, so to
                        speak? Did you feel you were going up as well as you should, better than you
                        should, or about the way you should?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It's very hard for me to judge that. I tended to be younger than
                    others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HEALY: I think I was the youngest one in my foreign service class. I've always
                    been fairly modest about deserving recognition quote unquote. I just felt,
                    “Well, do a good job and if you deserve a promotion, a promotion will come.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: And by and large, they came at a point when I was not yet becoming
                    concerned about why I wasn't being promoted. So I can't remember being
                    particularly concerned about the promotion schedule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think you sort of distanced yourself from the

                <p>HEALY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Men tend to discuss it so often, in my experience. They
                        talk about who's getting ahead and why did so and so get promoted and this
                        sort of thing. You didn't wish to participate in that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I didn't get much involved in that kind of thing, except when the
                    promotion list would come out. I'd be part of the usual group going over the
                    list and I'd hear somebody saying, “Well there's good old Joe Blow, he really
                    deserves it.” Or, “For god's sake, there's a loser if I ever saw one.” So I knew
                    this kind of thing went on, and in groups where conversations like that took
                    place, I participated but...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't waste a lot of your time or stay up at
                        night worrying about it?</hi>

                <p>HEALY: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I just figured if somebody got a promotion sooner than I did when I
                    thought that perhaps we were on a par, I would say, “Well he did a better job,
                    he had a better efficiency report, or there was some other type... But putting
                    it this way, I rather naively believed that the system worked properly.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask you a question that was suggested to me by
                        one of your colleagues, a woman who has had a career, a very...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I'm just going to get a cup of coffee, you go on and ask.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very successful career. She says that when she came into
                        the service she never expected to rise to a very high position. She never
                        could conceive of herself as being the boss of a man. Now did you ever have
                        that feeling, that is to say, that the expectation of sex roles in America
                        at the time you came in were such that you never saw yourself as rising very
                        far?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I didn't think about it, quite frankly. Remember, I had been in an
                    all-girls high school. I had been a schoolteacher. I had seen school principals
                    who were women, bossing men school teachers. It just never occurred to me. I
                    think I tend to take things one day at a time. I have the general outlines of
                    the future pretty fairly in mind, but I don't agonize from one day to the next
                    about when is the promotion list coming out? Will I be on it? Will I not be on
                    it? Will Joe Blow be on it when I think Joe Blow is a nincompoop? I don't worry
                    about those things and I do not recollect ever really worrying about bossing a
                    man, because for one thing, my first boss in the Foreign Service was a woman and
                    she was bossing men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes. Alice Griffith. So I saw it happening in the Foreign Service. I
                    assumed that the day would come when I would be bossing other people, and I
                    never thought of whether those other people would be men or women. I also knew
                    that at no point had I made any permanent commitment to the Foreign Service
                    because I knew at the time that if I elected to get married I would have to
                    resign.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: So it was a question of just going on from assignment to assignment,
                    taking things as they come, sticking with the Foreign Service until something
                    else offered, when I would have to make a decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The only one time I was tempted, the decision was made in favor of the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings us now to 1972, at which time you were
                        assigned to Brussels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Indeed. This was probably the wrong assignment for me. It was 1972, so
                    that means what? Sixteen years of European experience. I had tried now and again
                    to get out of EUR. I knew I needed experience in another geographic area, but I
                    was persuaded by the same logic that sent me from the Swiss desk to Switzerland,
                    to accept an assignment in Brussels. I shouldn't have done it, but everybody
                    said, “Brussels is a wonderful city in which to be living and you know the work
                    already.” So when a job as political officer came open in Brussels, friends who
                    worked with me in RPE said, “Go ahead Terry take it. You know you can do it, and
                    you'll be in Brussels.” So I took the easy way out. I should have been smarter
                    career-wise. I should have been counting the pennies and the dollars and
                    whatever and I should have avoided that assignment, but I took it.</p>
                <p>And it was the wrong job. I was overqualified for the job. I was too senior for
                    it. I discovered after the fact that the personnel officer, who realized this
                    when I didn't, almost blocked the assignment, but didn't. [laughs] “Oh, what
                    might have been, what might have been. Anyway. I didn't quite enjoy the work. I
                    couldn't find a comfortable tennis situation, which always makes me a more
                    agreeable person in the office. I just found that things weren't working out too
                    well.</p>
                <p>After a year I took myself back home for a family visit and came down to
                    Washington, talked to some people and said, “Look, it's not working out too
                    well. If there's a direct assignment that I'm qualified for, or whatever, I
                    would like to get out of Brussels.” Now what happened is that immediately, in
                    fact I may have already done that before I got to Washington after the year, I'd
                    already shortened the tour from three years to two-years. I knew I could not
                    take three years in this job, so it was now a two year assignment. I was half
                    way through it. And fortunately that was when the Geneva negotiations of
                    OSC[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] started.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>The first Helsinki agreement in general was now going to be hammered into a
                    concrete document in Geneva. I was assigned to work on the economic basket in
                    Geneva. I enjoyed the work very much. I was working with George Vest, who's now
                    the Director General [of the Foreign Service]. I was working with a bunch of
                    people I liked and could learn from. It was an exposure to international
                    organization work which had been always something interesting to me. I enjoyed
                    living in Geneva. Unfortunately Brussels hadn't counted on losing me for that
                    length of time.</p>
                <p>At a certain point I received a phone call from Brussels which in effect said,
                    “Terry, come back or don't bother coming back at all.” [laughter] In other
                    words, we've got to fill your position. Now either you come back to fill it, or
                    just cut the ties and throw your lot in with the people in Geneva, and we'll
                    find somebody else to fill the position. Well, I talked this over at length with
                    some friends in Geneva and they all persuaded me, they were wrong in the end,
                    but they did persuade me that the CSCE negotiations were very delicate and
                    subject to termination, cancellation, suspension at almost any point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: And that I could throw my hand in with the negotiations and find myself
                    without a job. So reluctantly I went back to Brussels, and was fortunately much
                    heartened within a matter of a couple of months by the knowledge that I had been
                    selected for senior training, and would be going to the National War College. So
                    I hung on for another six months in Brussels and came back to Washington for
                    that training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when you received the notice that you were to have
                        that training, did you then begin to look ahead and think this might mean
                        reaching the top of the heap?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: What is the top of the heap?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the sense of being an ambassador, I should
                        say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The thought crossed my mind that I might be fortunate, yes, but I also
                    realized there were too many imponderables.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HEALY: To my advantage was my political and economic background and the fact that
                    I was a woman. Somewhat to my disadvantage is that I was not well-known to
                    senior levels in the department, not at all. I had never developed that kind of
                    a relationship of working for a very powerful and important figure who in rising
                    to the top is able to bring with him the people he has relied on for excellent
                    work in the past. I'd never really had that relationship with anyone who was
                    moving up. The year at the War College I would not have traded for anything. It
                    was the best year the Foreign Service ever gave me. I enjoyed it; I thrived. It
                    was just a very stimulating year and I've already mentioned that at the end of
                    it, I was assigned to the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but getting back to the War College, you write a
                        paper, don't you, for the War College, and you take a trip to the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: You write a number of papers and there is domestic travel involved, but
                    basically the major travel was a three-week trip overseas toward the end of the
                    year. I elected to go to the Far East because I'd never been to that part of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can go where you wish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: You could sign up. Now if everybody signed up to go to the Far East then
                    there would be some shuffling of people who would end up going where they didn't
                    want to go, but I was fortunate and I was in the Far East in fact in the spring
                    of '75 when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese. It was a fascinating three
                    weeks. But as I say, the whole year was enormously stimulating. We had very,
                    very highly qualified people on the faculty. They brought in speakers who were
                    outstanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many were in your class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, I don't know. I do know that about 160 constitute a class over at the
                    National War College today and I imagine it was about that, 160.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many foreign service officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, probably about fifteen. Ten to fifteen. It's mostly military, of
                    course, army, navy, air force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it is considered quite a cachet, isn't it, to be
                        selected for the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>HEALY: Selection for senior training is... The military have a phrase called
                    “punching the ticket.” It is punching the ticket for foreign service officers.
                    It doesn't necessarily mean that the best people go to senior training.
                    Sometimes the best people actively avoid any senior training at all, because
                    they feel it will block their rather rapid rise to the top. They don't want to
                    waste a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It pulls them out of the mainstream.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: And they don't want to waste the year. So you will find that of the people
                    at the top, some have had senior training and some have not had senior training,
                    through their own desires. But I wouldn't have given up that year for
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to the Board of Examiners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were the senior examiner for the economic
                        cone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Right. It was a job, as I say, that I did not want. I actually went to the
                    deputy assistant secretary for personnel to protest that I did not want to do
                    this administrative job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you thought it would be monotonous work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I just didn't think it was the kind of job that would lead toward further
                    advancement in the Foreign Service. It was off on the sidelines. It was doing
                    administrative work, personnel work. I was not a personnel specialist. I was
                    looking at the jobs that others of my colleagues from the Foreign Service were
                    assigned to, coming out of the National War College, and I was unhappy with my
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: But I'm afraid that... I think I'm probably... Once I've made my protest I
                    generally tend to obey orders. So of course I ended up going to the Board of
                    Examiners, and I never regretted it because it was a very, very stimulating year
                    working with very, very good people, one of my best bosses in the Foreign
                    Service. It was a fine year. But it was still not a year that I would have
                    chosen myself.</p>

                <p>HEALY: No. No, that happened after I had gone to New Zealand. During the one year
                    I was in her office, Shaw Smith, head of the office... We all more or less did
                    what Carol Laise asked us to do. I was doing handicapped questions, spouses
                    questions, and then once the Carter administration was in place, I had to drop
                    just about everything to deal with the Carter administration's desire to
                    increase the number of women and minorities coming into the Department of
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Could you tell us a little more about this
                        handicapped and spouses issues? What were they at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, I remember that they were both very, very active at the same time to
                    the point that I had to go to Shaw and say I couldn't handle both. They were too
                    delicate, too sensitive, too complex. And I remember saying, “Shaw, I'm going to
                    drop the ball on one or the other and the noise will be heard throughout this
                    building.” But for the period when I was dealing with both, with spouses issues
                    it had to do with investigating such questions as right to work at an overseas
                    post. Could we by obtaining the right to work in Washington for, let's say, the
                    spouses of the New Zealand embassy, could we win for our own spouses in New
                    Zealand the right to work there?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That's one minor part of the whole issue. Paying wives to do
                    representation. Recognizing the work that spouses do in supporting the officer
                    in his work or her work. In any event it was a whole bundle of issues, questions
                    were always being raised and there was no previous pattern or guidance to
                    follow. It was all brand new territory. We were all stumbling around.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>And handicapped the same thing. We had questions as to whether a blind applicant
                    could take the foreign service written examination, and if so, should he or she
                    be given extra time and a reader? Under what conditions? How do they take the
                    oral examination? What if you're a paraplegic? All these questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was all a spin-off of the civil rights act?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think it had been growing over years. I think it had been growing over
                    years. Remember that the declaration of independence for spouses came in 1971,
                    so the spouses themselves had been talking about these issues and fermenting new
                    ideas and it was beginning to come to a head. It may well be that the Carter
                    administration sort of gave everybody a feeling that well, now was the time when
                    we might make, we might make some real progress. So all these issues were
                    bubbling and every time you turned around there was a new issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the American Foreign Service Wives Association very

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think they were, but I also recollect that it wasn't the senior wives,
                    it was more junior wives who were more actively raising these issues. Tandem
                    assignments, what happens when the wife takes and passes the foreign service
                    exam and you've got two people on your hands that have to be assigned? There
                    were new issues every day.</p>

                <p>HEALY: Certainly. They were invited to be reinstated back in '70 or '71.</p>

                <p>HEALY: New Zealand. Ambassador Laise felt very strongly that I should go out as a
                    DCM, but of course she faced, as did I, the fact that very few men, for many
                    reasons, would feel comfortable with the idea of a deputy, an alter ego, who is
                    a woman. Not to speak about what their wives might say about that. I knew or I
                    found out, after the fact perhaps, that Ambassador Selden, who'd already been
                    three years in New Zealand, had been through that summer and had interviewed a
                    number of people for the job, and had not apparently been terribly persuaded to
                    offer the job to anyone. So it is entirely thanks - and the previous comments I
                    made about not having any mentors, if I had one, Carol Laise was one, because it
                    was only through her action that I was recommended to Ambassador Selden and that
                    Ambassador Selden accepted me sight unseen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is certainly a compliment to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think it's a great credit to him. I think it's a great credit to him and
                    a great credit to his wife as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there's more problems with the wives in
                        situations like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I haven't the faintest idea, but I was lucky. I'm quite sure that a wife
                    [might] say to her ambassador husband, “Dear, I really don't like the idea of
                    your working that closely, day after day, with a woman. Find yourself a nice
                    young man.” I'm quite sure that is a possible reaction on the part of some
                    women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: But it didn't happen in my case, and I was always very grateful to Carol
                    Laise and to the Seldens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>HEALY: Very much. It's very far away. Oh, very far away. But I enjoyed the
                    country very much. I made some friends there. There was tennis. There was even a
                    bit of skiing. I enjoyed the work very much indeed. Ambassador Selden was a good
                    ambassador to work for. Perhaps it's just that we were compatible types, but I
                    have heard stories of DCMs who said they never had a chance to do anything
                    because the ambassador did everything. On the other hand, I've heard of DCMs who
                    said that they spent half their time trying to prevent the ambassador from doing
                    dumb things. None of that ever happened to me. So it was a very easy working
                    relationship and one that I enjoyed very much. I learned a great deal from him.
                    Ambassador Selden is a non-career ambassador, but he'd been in congress for many
                    years and he had been by the time I came he'd already been ambassador three
                    years. So I knew I had a lot to learn from him. He was five years there all
                    told.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he really? Did you have a very heavy schedule of
                        social things you had to go to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not as much as I would in a European assignment, perhaps. But enough,
                    because you had the Commonwealth connection, you had lots of visitors from
                    Britain, you had visiting royalty, if you can believe it. Ambassador and Mrs.
                    Selden were active socially.</p>
                <p>I was very fortunate though, enormously, enormously fortunate. Ambassador Selden
                    called me in shortly after my arrival to explain that he had found it necessary
                    to make other arrangements at the official residence. The Swiss couple who had
                    been working there, the man had reached the age of retirement and both had
                    elected to retire at the same time, so he had made other arrangements. I've
                    forgotten what they were. I think it involved somebody from Malaysia or Hong
                    Kong or Singapore or something. Very, very good arrangements but of course he
                    also had his wife, who was terrific. She worked very hard in that house. But
                    what he was saying to me was that while the man, who had previously served at
                    the residence, was retired, he was considerably older than his wife. Why didn't
                    I take on the wife as my housekeeper part-time? I had a very easy three years.
                    Oh, it was a wonderful, wonderful opportunity. So Maria [was my] housekeeper for
                    three years and did everything. I'd simply say, “Maria, I have to give a dinner
                    party for twelve next Thursday. Are you free?” Because she was doing catering
                    and I had to be sure that she was free to take care of my things. She would say,
                    “Yes.” I would say, “Fine, would you lay it on? She would lay on the waiters,
                    buy the food, offer me the menu, do everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Marvelous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, was I lucky!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of those jewels that you always hope you will

                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>HEALY: I couldn't believe it. In all aspects I had a very, very enjoyable and
                    successful and happy three years in New Zealand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's wonderful. The last six [months] of it I believe
                        were under Ambassador Martindell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Almost the last year. I think of it as two years with Ambassador Selden
                    and one year with Ambassador Martindell. But she was a bit late getting there.
                    There was a gap, I think, maybe of a couple of months. Then she was away, I
                    think, for a month at Christmas time. So all I guess in all we weren't together
                    a year, a calendar year, yes, but with gaps in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That was also a very, very happy association. Ambassador Martindell had
                    never been - of course she'd never been an ambassador before. So things were
                    quite new to her and yet our relationship was comfortable enough that I felt
                    that I could offer her advice at any time. And that worked out very happily as
                    well. I think she stayed on for another two years. No, let's see, I guess she
                    would have left... Well, since she was a Carter appointee, I guess she would
                    have left when the Reagan administration came in. But I'm not positive about
                    that. I think she may have stayed on maybe another six months past the
                    changeover and left in the summer of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think. I'm not really positive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been very interesting to you to see the
                        difference in styles between two different people, one very experienced and
                        one who was new to the job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: But it's inevitable because there is no such thing as a single way for an
                    ambassador to operate. It will be different from one person to the next,
                    inevitably and always. So when people talk about an ambassador who did this or
                    an ambassador who had a habit of doing this, you're basically speaking about
                    individuals. There may be no way you can sort of synthesize a list of
                    ambassadorial traits or characters. I think it's been tried. I think I've seen
                    such lists, but it's very hard to do because everything depends upon the
                    personal predilections of the individual, the background he or she brings to it,
                    the interactions within the office, the demands of the job, the culture in which
                    you're operating. You can go on forever as to why each ambassador is unique.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly, yes. But all of this must have been wonderful
                        training for you, because you're next assignment was to be an ambassador
                        yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: This is the classic example. This is the way it's supposed to happen, that
                    as DCM you learn how to be an ambassador and then you get to be an ambassador.
                    It doesn't always happen that a DCM ends up as an ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It was a surprise to me. It was nothing I'd asked for, nothing I expected
                    at that point. It happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you any idea who put your name up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: By that time Ambassador Laise had retired. I had really no idea. The
                    senior training officer in PER called me up out of the clear blue sky. We had
                    already been discussing possible onward assignments, possibly DCM somewhere
                    else, political counselor at a large post, perhaps even Washington. I remember
                    telling him that I always enjoy going back to Washington after a foreign
                    assignment. But he called me up out of the clear blue sky and said, “Terry, if
                    you were to be assigned as ambassador to Freetown, if you were to be offered
                    that position, ambassador to Freetown, would you accept?” Well, I had never been
                    to Africa at the time. I was pretty certain Freetown was the capital of Sierra
                    Leone, but I was not certain enough to say it over the telephone, I mean, reveal
                    my ignorance. So the first thing I said was, “Why do you ask, Bob?” He said,
                    “We've had a couple of instances where an offer was made and the person turned
                    it down, and it's pretty embarrassing for the department and the system and the
                    White House to have somebody refuse.” So I said, “Rest assured, Bob, I will not
                    refuse. If I am offered the ambassadorship to Freetown, I will accept.” Then of
                    course he proceeded to say, “Don't count on it, Terry, there are four or five
                    others on the list. It's a very dicey thing. I just have to ask the question and
                    just don't count on it.” I said, “Don't worry, Bob, I'm not buying ambassadorial
                    stationery,” or something to that effect. But he called back in about a month
                    and said that's it. You're going to be the next ambassador to Freetown.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes. It would have been the January-February-March time frame of 1980.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I was reading all the books I could lay my hands on. Not much, because I
                    was also under the obligation to reveal to nobody what my next assignment was.
                    You can hardly go around asking people if they have any books on Sierra Leone if
                    it's supposed to be a secret where you're going. So I had to be cautious, and I
                    was. I left, I think, sometime around June to get back to Washington and start
                    briefing myself on Sierra Leone, and I had a couple of months in Washington,
                    plus leave of course. I had perhaps three weeks leave and then three or four
                    weeks in Washington for briefings, to attend the ambassadorial conference, for
                    the hearing on the Hill, and then the swearing in. And all of this was marred by
                    my brother's unexpected death that same summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your mother and father still alive at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: My father died in '71 and my mother is senile, so she didn't
                    understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How tragic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That was too bad. But my sister and her family and my brother and his
                    family came down from New York for the swearing-in. We had two or three other
                    guests. I did not really invite anyone to attend the swearing-in except two or
                    three of my oldest friends and Anton De Porte, and there was, of course, no
                    party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this on the eighth floor of the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It was in David Newsom's office. I'd asked Roz Ridgeway to swear me in.
                    Roz is an old friend. I think at that point she was counselor at the department.
                    But for some reason Roz couldn't. I think she was out of town. She asked Dave
                    Newsom, who was then the undersecretary for political affairs, to swear me in.
                    And while Dave Newsom doesn't know me, hardly at all, he very kindly performed
                    the ceremony and that was it, since we were making it very quiet and very
                    informal. Then I went up to New York with my family that same day, spent another
                    few days with them and took off for Sierra Leone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was your choice to have a very small ceremony?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Because of my brother's death.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I'm sorry, of course, naturally. Stupid of me. Can you
                        remember any anecdotes about your appearance before the Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not really. As happens in the summertime, the Senate was behind in its
                    work and pushing toward what I guess would have been the Labor Day recess and
                    they had a backup of ambassadorial appointments. Three of us - was it three of
                    us or was it five of us - were going to Africa, and rather than have us appear
                    individually one by one in front of the committee, we appeared as a group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did you in batches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: They did us in batches. [laughter] I don't know if it was a first or what.
                    The senators were asking the usual questions and we were providing rather
                    standard answers, because it was basically pro forma. We were career people, we
                    were going to small African countries. There was no controversy involved with
                    those countries or with us as individuals. So I would say that the hearing
                    lasted about fifteen minutes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, is that all? Did you happen to be the only woman in
                        that particular group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think I was. I'm not absolutely positive. I think I was the only one,
                    but I am not positive. I remember there was somebody. Barbara Watson was going
                    out to Malaysia, but she wouldn't have been in that group of three or five of
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of African ambassadors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Of African ambassadors. But there may have been, there's something nagging
                    at my mind but I can't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frances Cook.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Frances Cook. When did she [go out]?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She went in June of 1980.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Then no, she would have not been appearing with me in August before a
                    Senate committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's it, so I think you must have been the only
                        one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Perhaps there were only three of us. Yes, two men and me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two men and you. When you were at the War College, were
                        you the only woman from the State Department in that particular class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes. There was only one other women among the student body. She was an
                    Army colonel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: She and I were the two women in the student body. Today that has changed,
                    of course, there are more women, but let's face it, there are not too many
                    people with the proper experience and age, which would have meant that they
                    would have started their careers twenty-five years ago, twenty years ago.
                    There's not a large pool to draw from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is exactly it. It will take years before...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, we've already got a good ten-year backlog already. Ten years from
                    now we'll have plenty of women to draw from in the way of a pool for something
                    like senior training. I think, I hope, I may be wrong. I have not looked at the
                    figures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of preparing did you do? You said that you read
                        and briefed yourself. Did you talk to the diplomatic group from Sierra Leone
                        here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I paid a courtesy call on the ambassador. You don't really expect them to
                    brief you on what's going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. Mostly through reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Through reading and talking to people on the desk. Talking to AID officers
                    who had served in Sierra Leone, talking to Peace Corps people who had served in
                    Sierra Leone, USIA, talking to the intelligence agencies, to Defense. When you
                    really start digging around for information in this town, you can find it in a
                    lot of different places. Then I went up to New York for two or three days to
                    talk to businesses and banks.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation between the United States and
                        Sierra Leone at that time? How were the relationships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The relationship was normal. It was fine. Sierra Leone is a small country
                    which looks to the United States for the little bit of aid we feel we can spare
                    for a country that has no enormous importance for our national interests. The
                    relationship is a calm and peaceful one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No particular problems of AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, my only concern was that because there were no problems, because there
                    was no high visibility of national interest, I was a little bit afraid that if
                    anyone wanted to cut budgets, cut AID programs, cut Peace Corps programs, Sierra
                    Leone, along with about twenty-five other African countries, would be logical
                    candidates for the list of cuts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. How did the host country react to having a
                        woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I don't think they care. They had a woman mayor. They have women in their
                    own diplomatic corps. I forget whether I was the first woman ambassador to serve
                    there. I have no recollection that I was, so I presume there have been other
                    women ambassadors there. There is still a little bit of the cultural signs of a
                    male society. The dinner club was the primary social club in town, dinners once
                    a month, I think, for the political and economic elite of Freetown. That was
                    exclusively male. And, in fact, since the American ambassador had always been a
                    member there was an actual vote taken - well, I can't say that because I don't
                    know that an actual vote was taken - but I was definitely considered for a
                    membership and the decision was made to stick with the all-male membership with
                    which they were familiar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you remember your arrival at the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who met you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The traditional meeters and greeters, the DCM, my secretary. I believe the
                    AID director. The USIA director was there and somebody from the office of
                    protocol, of course.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: We landed at the Freetown airport. I guess I was on French Air and thanks
                    to some of the economies of Washington, I was in second class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't mean it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I certainly do mean it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I thought ambassadors always went first class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: At some point in the Carter administration the decision was made that the
                    president's personal representatives would travel tourist. The announcement came
                    over the loudspeaker, “Would the American ambassador please identify himself.”
                    When I pressed the button and called for the flight attendant, I could hear the
                    whispers. Number one, I was a woman, and number two, I wasn't in first class
                    where they expected to find me [laughter] and hadn't been able to find me.
                    They'd asked, I think, every first class passenger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And why did they want you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: To take me off the plane first because protocol was waiting for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happens when you arrive at a post and you're going to
                        be the ambassador? You're met by a group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Your own people, your senior people from the embassy will be there to
                    greet you, along with either the chief of protocol or his representative. You
                    are a non-person until you present your credentials. I was able to function
                    inside the office and inside my own home, but I was not permitted to call on
                    anyone or take up official public duties until after the presentation of
                    credentials. Since President Stevens was about to pay an informal visit to
                    Washington, protocol hurried up the presentation of credentials ceremony. I got
                    there on the eighth of September, I think, and presented credentials on the
                    eighteenth, ten days later. Once I had presented credentials I was officially
                    recognized and could start paying courtesy calls on my ambassadorial colleagues,
                    government ministers. I could start entertaining. I could attend functions. The
                    key point comes with the presentation of credentials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And can you describe that ceremony?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>HEALY: It's a very formal one. The president sent his own limousine for me,
                    flying the American flag, and, I think perhaps the Sierra Leone flag. It was an
                    open car. The chief of protocol was in the car. My DCM was in the car as well.
                    Then there [were] a couple of others from the embassy who traveled separately,
                    but in this particular car there was the chief of protocol and me and then my
                    DCM. We drove with motorcycle escort to State House, where I was escorted to a
                    waiting room, and after a few minutes wait, escorted in to the reception room,
                    the formal reception room of President Stevens. There the ceremony is also cut
                    and dried since we had exchanged remarks ahead of time. I believe I spoke first
                    and then presented my letters of credence to him, then he replied and then they
                    brought out the champagne. We toasted each other and we sat and chatted for
                    three or five minutes. Then he rose to indicate that I could leave. I took my
                    leave of him and back we drove. Oh, this time with the flag flying. That's
                    right, the American flag was not flying on the limousine when I was brought into
                    town. Then we just drove back home where I offered the chief of protocol again
                    the obligatory glass of champagne and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you wear any special clothing for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, I think I wore the same dress I wore for my swearing-in, and no gloves
                    and no hat. Sierra Leone, thank god, is an informal country. I don't recollect,
                    I might have carried a pair of gloves. I certainly wasn't wearing them. And I
                    was not wearing a hat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just an ordinary afternoon dress, you wore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Something a bit better than a dress you'd wear to the office, the dress
                    that I wore to my swearing-in. I thought if it was appropriate for one, it's
                    appropriate for the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. And the president, did he wear a business
                        suit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: As I recollect, he wore a business suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what about your own DCM? He was there when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: He was there when I arrived. He had been there over a year, I think. That
                    would have been September of '80, September of '81... Yes, he had been there for
                    a year and as his second year was coming to an end, he asked if he could extend
                    for a third year and I agreed that he could stay on for a third year. So Dick
                    had three years in Sierra Leone.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The staff of the embassy was quite small, of course. When it comes to
                    Department of State people, counting myself and the DCM, the American secretary,
                    the consular officer, and communicators, we couldn't have been more than seven
                    or eight at most. USIA had one officer and frequently had a short term junior
                    officer trainee. AID had three officers and a secretary. Peace Corps had perhaps
                    four staff members living in Freetown and directing the efforts of two hundred
                    volunteers upcountry. We had what you can call the odd bod floating around, semi
                    attached to the embassy such as the AFL-CIO labor advisor, but that was about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to develop a close relationship with the
                        head of state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I never tried to develop a close relationship with the head of state. I
                    think it would be inappropriate. Relations between an ambassador and head of
                    state, I think, are best characterized by formality, openness, but no attempt to
                    be buddy-buddy, except in very, very unusual circumstances, which have existed,
                    I'm sure, in the past in certain posts in the world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It depended upon the particular issue that was on the fire at the moment.
                    I might be calling on somebody in Treasury or the Development Bank, or I might
                    be talking to one of the UN people about financial affairs. It depends on the
                    issue. But after your initial courtesy calls and some effort at developing
                    contacts, you should know somebody anywhere to whom you can turn for the
                    information you need, or to make the points you feel have to be made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you develop a social relationship with these people, or
                        their wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, yes. Well, it's a bit harder with the wives because the wives have
                    their own social circles which exist when everybody else is in the office. But
                    yes, certainly in the evening affairs I organized, I would attempt to establish
                    a more friendly relationship with a particular minister or deputy minister and
                    his wife. But again, given the fact that you are the official representative of
                    one country and they are official representatives of another, you realize that
                    in most instances your relationship will have to remain formal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: You certainly, of course, develop official relations and friendly
                    relations with the other members of the diplomatic corps, and since there the
                    relationship does not tend to be quite so formal, you're more inclined to
                    develop personal friends, or people with whom you are inclined to do such
                    personal things as play a friendly game of tennis.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It's not so much by personalities, there is always that, but it's just a
                    little bit easier to suggest a game of tennis to the British High Commissioner
                    than it is to suggest a game of tennis to the foreign secretary, the foreign
                    minister. If he were a great tennis player and I very much wanted to play tennis
                    with him, I would suggest it. But that didn't happen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: There was a Chinese ambassador, a Cuban ambassador, and a Soviet Union
                    ambassador, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you invited to things that they were at? Did it

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The North Korean ambassador and I just did not even acknowledge each
                    other's existence. The Cuban ambassador was the dean of the diplomatic corps so
                    there was some inevitable, as I recollect, there was some inevitable formality
                    of acknowledging. (End of tape)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your relationship with the local press? Did they

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not really. This is a very, very small town in a very small country. These
                    papers are struggling to find the paper and the ink to print an issue once a
                    week. They're not going to waste time on what the American ambassador is doing.
                    The reporting was more inclined to focus on what the government was doing that
                    would effect the lives of the people of the country. There was no such thing as
                    a gossip column, really, no. It was very basic newspaper reporting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think there was some journalists who came through in January of '81 as
                    part of the annual OAU meeting which took place in Sierra Leone that year. But
                    other than that there would be nothing that would bring an American journalist
                    to Sierra Leone.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not really, because there were so few American visitors. We had one
                    American prisoner who was in jail for a good year or so, and I took considerable
                    interest in his case because he was in fact the only one. But eventually he was
                    released and I think stayed on in the country. Visa problems sometimes did
                    arise. Problems with students wanting to study in the United States. Some small
                    handful of citizenship problems, but it was not a very active consular post.</p>

                    of it Food for Peace, PL 480. It was basically... Much of the money was
                    concentrated in what we call the Acre program which was an agricultural research
                    and extension program designed to increase the agriculture output of the small
                    farmer in the country.</p>

                <p>Did foreign service inspectors come while you were at the mission?</p>
                <p>HEALY: We did have an inspection while I was at the mission. I believe it was
                    sometime in the early summer of '82. I'm not absolutely certain about that, it
                    might have been '81.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>HEALY: There were no problems, as I recall. They were basically looking at a
                    number of things, as they always do, reporting, economic and political
                    reporting, consular work, and administration, particularly auditing, checking
                    contracts to be sure they were properly done. We had a problem with a dishonest
                    employee which was of interest to them. They checked into that fairly carefully.
                    They checked into whether or not we would be able to prosecute him in a court of
                    law. But for the inspectors, Sierra Leone was, as I recollect, a two or three
                    day inspection, perhaps it was a whole week, but I think they may have been
                    there for that length of time simply because of plane connections out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel they were fair in their assessments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Of course. As I say, it does not ring any strong bells in my memory so
                    there clearly couldn't have been any problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Getting back to your function, particularly the
                        representational one, how often did you entertain officially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, a lot depended upon circumstances, whether we had visitors, for
                    example, such as Warren Robbins, the museum director, or whether a particular
                    occasion caused it, the visit of an American ship, for example, July Fourth
                    certainly. I would say I probably entertained about once every week, perhaps ten
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a particular type of entertaining you
                        preferred, such as a reception or a dinner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I generally tended to prefer a lunch or a dinner. Receptions are difficult
                    in the sense that they're very tiring because you are on your feet for perhaps
                    two hours. You have to make a very special effort to get around and talk to a
                    large number of people, which means that you don't have a chance to engage in
                    any discussion in depth with any one or two or three people. I generally found
                    lunches and dinners more satisfactory from both the personal point of view and
                    the professional point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Who planned your menus, and took care of the seating
                        arrangements, and flowers, and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>HEALY: Generally speaking, I did, but my supervision was minimal because the
                    household servants had been well trained by previous ambassadors' wives. They
                    did the flowers or the gardeners did the flowers. I would select a menu and
                    provide some kind of minimal oversight. I can remember that the first time I
                    gave a lunch, I asked for curried chicken and discovered, only after all the
                    buffet guests had gone through the line, that the cook had not cut the chicken
                    into little pieces, but had produced chicken breasts for every guest [laughter].
                    Since it was buffet and people were supposed to be eating on their laps, it
                    provided some difficulties and I was quite annoyed with the cook. He didn't do
                    that again. But apart from little problems like that, they were well trained and
                    I could just simply say, “We'll have this for the first course, this for the
                    second, and we'll have this for dessert,” and that was it. I was not very
                    demanding when it came to gourmet cooking. I couldn't be, of course. And with
                    regard to desserts, I was normally content with a fresh fruit salad or some kind
                    of a pudding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you import a lot of food from, say, Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes, I imported virtually everything except some fresh stuff. Fruits in
                    particular were available locally. Vegetables were a little hard to come by.
                    Tomatoes were available, some lettuce, but by and large I imported everything
                    from either the United States or, to some degree, from Denmark. Mostly from
                    Denmark we imported the liquor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to eat lettuce, the local lettuce and fresh
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, yes, the servants in the house were very well trained when it came to
                    boiling water and preparing fresh fruits and vegetables. I had no trouble and I
                    don't believe any of my guests did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it you who took care of the residence accounts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, basically it was my secretary. And I must say my secretary was
                    terribly efficient in this respect. She lived right next door in the staff
                    housing and was very, very competent and conscientious about this kind of thing.
                    As I recollect, the servants, the cook - is the one in particular who would buy
                    some fresh fruits and vegetables and some fresh fish and shrimp and lobster -
                    the cook would present bills and I would carry them into the office and Liliana
                    would pay them, either directly to the merchant involved, or by sending the
                    money home to the cook. But by and large, if a vendor came to the door with
                    lobsters, for example, I normally relied on Liliana to decide whether they were
                    needed. I'm afraid I also let Liliana do the bargaining on the price. She was an
                    enormous help to me in that respect.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: There was no such thing as dry cleaning in town. I saw to it that I didn't
                    buy anything that wasn't easily washable. There was one hair dresser in town,
                    perhaps more than one, but the one I happened to go to was at a small hotel in
                    the center of town. When I say small, I should say it was the hotel in the
                    center of town, the other major hotels being out by the ocean front. The
                    principle operator at the hairdressing shop was British, married to a lawyer, a
                    Lebanese lawyer. She generally was able to get her hands on the equipment and
                    the expendable supplies she needed. Perhaps, and my memory is a little vague on
                    this, perhaps I did send to the States to a drugstore for the supplies for hair
                    coloring. At this point I just don't even remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Much of Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Africa is considered “unhealthy,”
                    but what with the use of anti-malarials and with reasonable precautions, most
                    people stayed pretty healthy. I myself was very fortunate. I had a problem with
                    a skin rash and a problem with a bad back, but the bad back, of course, had
                    nothing to do with West Africa. As for the skin rash, it eventually, after quite
                    a long period of time, cleared up. It may have been an allergy, it may have been
                    sun, it may have been heaven knows what.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The embassy itself had nothing, but only a block away at Peace Corps
                    headquarters, we had a health room staffed by the Peace Corps doctor, who was
                    there except for the times he was traveling upcountry to look after the Peace
                    Corps volunteers, or on a trip to Liberia, because he was also responsible for
                    the Peace Corps volunteers in Liberia, as I recollect. But there was also a
                    registered nurse, a Sierra Leonean registered nurse and a couple of medical
                    technicians, and the embassy people used it regularly for consultations and
                    shots and pills or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those medicines came from the States, I presume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I believe most of them did, yes, although certainly the Peace Corps doctor
                    was in constant touch with local physicians and was able to refer people with
                    specialized complaints, as for example my skin rash, to a local doctor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any of your people have to go to hospital while you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HEALY: Let me think. I do know that we had a couple of people, in fact more than
                    a couple, who had to be medically evacuated. Once or twice under emergency
                    conditions, but normally just as a routine precaution, either for pregnancy or
                    whatall. A few people were hospitalized, yes. Generally speaking we used a
                    private clinic or the military hospital up at Wilburforce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, where's Wilburforce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Wilburforce is part of Freetown. It's a neighborhood in Freetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: But fortunately most people managed to stay healthy enough to avoid the
                    need for hospital treatment except for perhaps a day or two for observation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any babies born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: While I was there I don't recollect that there were any babies born in
                    Freetown. Before I came I do know that one young woman, a foreign service
                    officer, did have her baby in Freetown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Otherwise they went up to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It depends on the individual. The one baby born while I was in Freetown
                    was born in Latin America because the mother was originally from one of the
                    Latin American countries and she went back home to have her baby there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Department allows people to go where they wish in
                        cases like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Really, I'm not able to say. I think that the department would only pay
                    for a trip to Germany for a pregnancy and this was cost reconstructed travel. I
                    think that's the way it worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you've mentioned Liliana. Was she the only personal
                        secretary you had while you were at the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HEALY: Liliana was the only American secretary at the embassy. There was an
                    American secretary in the AID mission, and I believe that was it. But Liliana
                    acted as my secretary, as the confidential secretary to the entire mission, and
                    her efforts were supplemented by part-time, temporary work on the part of one or
                    two of the wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. I can't recall, did you say you did or did not have
                        women officers at the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: We had one woman officer by the time I left and there was... We're talking
                    now about the Department of State?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: And there was one woman officer, I know, at post before I came. The one I
                    mentioned who had her baby at post. Then we had, of course, one or two women
                    professionals over at Peace Corps, not at AID, as I recollect. But we had one or
                    two women, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did they enjoy the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I assume they did. I never sat down with them in particular as opposed to
                    anyone else. Naturally when an ambassador sits down with somebody and says, “How
                    are you enjoying the post?” you're not certain you're getting a very straight
                    answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true. What did the wives of your officers do to
                        occupy their days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Most of the wives were busy at part-time jobs, or just raising their
                    children. There weren't too many children at post, but the DCM's wife was
                    raising her children. She was also a registered nurse, so she was a great help
                    informally to a lot of people at post. A couple of the wives were occupied
                    working as secretaries on a part-time basis at the embassy. One wife was in
                    charge of running the self-help program on a part-time basis. Another wife was
                    helping run the little commissary on a part-time basis. One of the Peace Corps
                    wives was doing some teaching of English, as I recollect. Most everybody
                    interested in doing something was able to find something to do, even if it
                    happened to be only volunteer work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So this kept morale high, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I would expect so, yes. I think that most people, as I say, found
                    something to keep them busy and interested and happy.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Did the wives help you out at parties? Did they help
                        serve as assistant hostesses or that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: There was never anything as formal as that. I mean everybody knew that as
                    Americans invited to my house, they were, in a sense, under a certain
                    responsibility to see that things went smoothly, but I never said anything to
                    them about it and so far as I recollect everybody pitched in to make the party a
                    success, as any guest does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, exactly. How often did you entertain your staff? Were
                        they included in your parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I made a special effort and Liliana helped me in this. I made a special
                    effort to see that people were included regularly. I also, however, did not want
                    to burden them, because being invited to receptions or dinner parties that are
                    basically for official reasons, is not always something that a person wants to
                    do. So there were many times when I would issue an invitation to an official
                    reception or dinner, but through Liliana I would make it quite clear that if
                    somebody did not really want to come or had something else of importance to do,
                    it was not a command performance. Then when it came to entertaining the staff
                    separately, I did that now and again, particularly to something like
                    Thanksgiving dinner, when I might have twenty people or so over for a turkey
                    dinner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do for the Fourth of July?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The usual reception. I tried to make it around lunch time or early
                    evening, and I was sorely tempted to cut it down to nothing but a glass of
                    champagne and a toast and everybody go home, but I never managed to get around
                    to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that strictly an all-American affair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, no, no, no. For one thing I'd have a hard time coming up with enough
                    Americans to make a reception. No, the July Fourth reception in the tradition of
                    the Foreign Service is to entertain the members of the host government, not to
                    entertain Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Funny, I've been at posts where it's been strictly
                        American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: If I gave a reception strictly for Americans, I would be paying for it out
                    of my own pocket.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I'm not about to give a reception for a host of hundreds, if I could find
                    hundreds for that purpose. No, official representation is official
                    representation. The July Fourth party was for members of the government of
                    Sierra Leone and members of the diplomatic corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. What did you do for recreation, to keep yourself
                        fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I played tennis and I played golf. My back problem limited the tennis
                    playing pretty severely. But I did manage to get around the golf course a couple
                    of times a week, so I did have that amount of exercise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any good place to swim?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, heavens, yes, Freetown has one of the loveliest beaches in West
                    Africa. I'm not much of a swimmer, though, so it was not a sport that interested
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you obtain books and periodicals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I had my own subscriptions and we had a small post library. I know that
                    when I first came, I brought along about a hundred paperbacks that I had
                    selected indiscriminately from the supply of books that the American foreign
                    service wives had upstairs, I guess on the eighth floor somewhere, in the
                    Department of State, and every now and again I would send for another supply of
                    any hundred paperbacks. I was not so much interested myself, I always seemed to
                    have enough to read, as I was in restocking the little paperback library at the
                    embassy. And of course every American, as soon as he would finish a paperback
                    would put it back in the library, so there was a regular circulation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I get the feeling, Terry...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: We also had the library, of course, at USIS.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. Of course. I get the feeling that you were very
                        concerned about your staff, that you wanted to make this sort of a family.
                        Am I correct in thinking that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I am concerned, I always have been concerned about the staff, but I also
                    am not the kind of person to interfere too much in their personal and private
                    lives. Freetown is a small town already and I wanted to ensure that while I was
                    aware of any difficulties anybody might have, and I was available to help if I
                    could, and I certainly did everything I could to make life pleasant both at work
                    and elsewhere for the staff, I did not want to give them the feeling that I was
                    watching every move they made, that they had no privacy. So you have to walk a
                    very thin line there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Did you travel a lot around the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I traveled a fair amount within Sierra Leone itself, but not outside,
                    no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was official, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: This was official within Sierra Leone, yes. But I did not have a chance to
                    get to anywhere else in Africa, except for a three-day trip to Liberia, which
                    was business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Did you have young officers who were just starting
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, heavens, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What steps did you take to assure that they got the proper
                        training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Generally speaking, I would talk to them when they first came, indicate to
                    them that my door was open, give them some general bits of advice, and just say,
                    “Come talk to the DCM, come talk to me, come talk to Liliana.” We were a very
                    small operation. As I've said, my main effort was to see to it that I kept out
                    of people's hair, rather than the other way around. We saw each other every day,
                    so there was always this continual exchange. The DCM, as well, had been charged
                    with the responsibility of seeing to it that the new junior officers were given
                    the guidance they needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to rotate them in the various sections?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>HEALY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The mission was much too small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand. What would you say were your major
                        successes, Terry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That is very difficult to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know, it's an awkward question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Since there were few problems there, I certainly don't feel I can make any
                    great claims to solving any. I would just say that I minded the store properly
                    and left things in at least as good shape as I found them, and perhaps in better

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any way in which your being a woman
                        contributed to your being able to carry this out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not really. Not really. West Africa is very receptive to a business role
                    for women or a social role, or even a leadership role for women, since some of
                    the ethnic groups have, in fact, very frequently for many, many years in the
                    past, had paramount chiefs who are women. I didn't feel that there was any great
                    surprise at having a woman ambassador.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes, I would say I was. I wish that in some other way, shape, and form I
                    could have made a greater contribution to the welfare of Sierra Leone, but given
                    the restrictions on the amount of AID available, the US government did what it
                    could there. There was no possible way I could get the millions in AID I would
                    have wanted to put the country right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think, looking back, that your presence made a
                        difference in Sierra Leone-US relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>HEALY: That's impossible for me to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you returned to the United States, and before I get
                        onto that, is there anything you'd like to add to sum up your experience and
                        how you felt about the experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No. No, I think what we have been touching on in these past hours has
                    pretty well covered it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fine. Well when you came back, did you have difficulty
                        adjusting to life back in the States, a reverse culture shock?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not really. Not really. When I returned to the States I was assigned to
                    the University of South Florida as a Foreign Affairs Fellow. I worked there at
                    the Center for International Affairs for ten or eleven months. I remember one of
                    the professors there saying to me that re-entry must be a problem for me, to
                    leave the world that I had known as ambassador with a chauffeur-driven car and
                    servants and a large house and come back to the United States where down in
                    Florida I didn't even have a secretary, and I can remember saying to him, “No,
                    Charlie, Sierra Leone was not the real world. This is the real world, where
                    people make their own beds, and they buy their own food at the supermarket, and
                    they make their own meals. They even sometimes have to struggle along without a
                    secretary.” So I knew precisely where things fitted in properly and that being
                    an ambassador is not the normal state of events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good way to put it. And then after you were in
                        Florida, you came here to Fort McNair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: After a year in Florida when I did some... I taught a course of my own
                    about the Foreign Service and I was a guest lecturer for a number of different
                    professors and for a number of different organizations. I was a resource person,
                    really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you called a diplomat-in-residence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>HEALY: No, I use that as a handy way of describing what I did, but there are two
                    programs in the Department of State. One is diplomats-in-residence and the other
                    is foreign affairs fellows. I was a foreign affairs fellow. Both do more or less
                    the same kind of thing. The titles are different because of technicalities
                    within the Department of State about funding these positions. After a year down
                    in Florida, I came up to Washington to serve on the faculty at the Industrial
                    College of the Armed Forces here at Fort McNair. I had been a student ten years
                    ago at the National War College and when the opportunity came up, I seized it,
                    because I did enjoy my time there as a student, and thought I would enjoy just
                    as much being on the faculty at the sister institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You enjoy teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I do enjoy teaching. I don't think of myself as a natural teacher, but I
                    do enjoy the academic atmosphere, the stimulation of being able to talk about a
                    lot of different issues with people who know what they're talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are you teaching here? Could you describe that for
                        me?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That gets a little bit difficult. Basically, I'm teaching in the
                    international affairs phase of the curriculum here at the Industrial College.
                    The core curriculum includes a great deal on economics, mobilization, manpower
                    management, resource management, and my principle teaching responsibility has
                    come in the phase that is devoted to international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your students are mainly from the armed forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The students at the Industrial College are drawn principally from the
                    different branches of the military services. About 75% of the student body comes
                    from the military. The other 25% comes from the civilian employees of the US
                    government, principally, the Department of State, Foreign Service, and the
                    civilian employees of the Department of Defense. But we also will have one civil
                    servant from the Department of Labor, one civil servant from Treasury, one civil
                    servant from this, that, or the other agency of the government. They're
                    generally colonels and lieutenant colonels or equivalent grades. They have been
                    selected for this very senior training at either the National War College or the
                    Industrial College of the Armed Forces with a view to preparing them for more
                    senior assignments yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it's quite a plum to be sent here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It's a select group, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Select group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do they decide who goes to this college and who goes
                        to the War College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: A lot depends upon the interests of the student, a lot depends upon his
                    background, what he wants to do, or she, I should say, because we do have female
                    students at both colleges. I know that when I was selected for senior training,
                    I specifically asked for the National War College, because I knew that the core
                    curriculum at the Industrial College included a good bit of economics and I had
                    already had, fairly recently, the intensive economic training course at the
                    Foreign Service Institute. So I pointed out that I felt my economic strengths
                    would be complemented by the political and strategic courses at the National War
                    College. And I presume other students have other reasons for asking to be
                    assigned to one or the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any students from other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Not as part of the student body at the War College or the Industrial
                    College, but the umbrella organization for both colleges and for three or four
                    other institutions is the National Defense University. The National Defense
                    University recently started a program to bring ten or eleven or so international
                    fellows to Fort McNair every year from different allied or friendly countries
                    overseas. These international fellows, and this year they come from such
                    countries as Germany, Britain, Somalia, Korea, Peru, et cetera, these
                    international fellows follow a curriculum of their own, but they are integrated
                    for the first few months into the core curriculum of the National War College,
                    and then for perhaps the second half of the academic year into the core
                    curriculum of the Industrial College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Changing the subject now to one that concerns you,
                        only you, do you consider yourself a feminist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That's a little bit hard to say. I've never been deeply involved in
                    fighting for women's rights, but I have supported, for example, the Women's
                    Action Organization in the Department of State by becoming a member. I would
                    tend to say I'm probably middle of the road feminist. I realize that a lot of
                    what has happened in the past has been part of the culture and it's a little bit
                    unfair to lay it at the doorstep of a particular, individual man, unless that
                    person turns out to be extremely prejudiced.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then that was your attitude towards the women's movements
                        in the sixties, or did you think they were perhaps too strident? Sixties and
                        seventies, I should say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Some were. Some were. I was just heavily involved in my own work, and I
                    remember at the time that the Women's Action Organization became prominent in
                    the Department of State, I, by pure chance, was more heavily involved in a
                    different issue at the Department of State, which was whether or not the Foreign
                    Service should become a union, should be unionized. And if so, whether the
                    recognized union should be the professional association, AFSA (American Foreign
                    Service Association), or whether it should be AFGE (American Federation of
                    Government Employees), which was an already organized union of government
                    employees. So for some reason I was not terribly aware of what was going on in
                    the field of women's rights in the Department of State, although the two
                    movements, one for a union and one for women's rights, were active at almost the
                    exact same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which did you favor, the AFGE or the AFSA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I was in favor of having AFSA perform the functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they did indeed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Eventually it ended up that way, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you look back can you think of anything along your
                        career that you wish you had done differently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I'm sure if I thought hard, I'd find something, many things, in fact, I
                    might have wished I'd done differently. But I'm almost equally certain that I'd
                    probably never confess them to anyone. No, offhand I might have tried harder,
                    for example, to get out of European Affairs. I might have decided that after
                    five years in Common Market work in Washington, a move to work in Common Market
                    affairs in Brussels was not the wisest thing. Various things like that I might
                    have changed in retrospect, but that's a sort of fruitless occupation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really is. But as an ambassador looking back, were you
                        satisfied with the way you handled that assignment? Or, looking back, would
                        you have changed [some things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, I probably would have tried to do a little bit more, perhaps, in
                    training junior officers personally, but then we had so few and they were so
                    busy doing the work that there were really few so-called training opportunities.
                    I might have been more active in one area or another, but once, again that's
                    hindsight. You never have the opportunity to do over again things that you might
                    wish [you had done differently].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just asking because part of the book is going to be to
                        recommend to young women coming along things that they might want to look
                        into themselves. What do you think is the future of women in the
                        service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, I think the question itself should not need to be asked these days.
                    I think the future of women in the Foreign Service is whatever they can make of
                    it for themselves. The Foreign Service has, in my career time, always permitted
                    women to enter. The department has not been as welcoming in past years, in early
                    years, as it is today, but I think that women have every opportunity, and it's
                    up to them to make a career for themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any characteristics thought of as typically
                        feminine that make women more valuable than men in certain circumstances, or
                        with certain groups of people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I would have to think about that very hard. I know I've heard people say
                    that women make very good consular officers because they do tend to be patient
                    with people's problems, and sympathetic, and that perhaps distressed people are
                    more inclined to discuss their problems with women than with men. I don't know
                    about that. I just cannot... I think you need a professional assessment for
                    something like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the idea that has been told me that, in
                        emerging countries, women do a very good job because they are perceived as
                        less threatening? Do you go along with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I am not a professional in that field of human behavior. I don't know. I
                    think too much depends upon the individuals involved to make
                    generalizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Do you have any advice to give to young women who
                        would like a career in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>HEALY: Well, I would suggest they prepare themselves well or they will never get
                    into the Foreign Service. I would suggest that they bring to the job
                    requirements every bit of skill and dedication that they have. You cannot
                    succeed in the Foreign Service by doing a half-hearted job. It's a job that
                    demands a great deal of you. And I would hope they would recognize that the
                    nature of diplomacy may be changing in future years, that it's becoming a
                    profession that is more dangerous than it used to be, and one that will require
                    perhaps greater language skills in the future than in the past.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I think that thirty years ago the Department of State was not putting as
                    much emphasis on language ability as it does today. I think that a lot of
                    foreigners were more inclined to tolerate Americans who had no language skills.
                    I think a lot of the people with whom we carried on most of our dealings spoke
                    English. I'm thinking of western Europeans. I'm thinking of east Asians. But I
                    think in this day and age... It has always been important to speak languages,
                    but I think that it's becoming a tool that more and more will be demanded of
                    Americans, whereas there's been more tolerance in the past for Americans who do
                    not have language skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good point. What particular courses would you
                        suggest that young women study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: In order to join the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Anybody could provide that kind of information. Everybody says the same
                    thing. They should take American history, American government, political
                    science, international relations, the usual courses, twentieth century
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had it suggested they study law.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>HEALY: I see no reason why they should spend three years studying law in order to
                    come into the Foreign Service. You study law to become a lawyer, not to enter
                    the Foreign Service. I would suggest that the intellectual discipline of
                    studying law might be useful, but surely there are better ways of acquiring
                    intellectual discipline than taking a three-year law course that you have no
                    intention of using.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think about the classics, Terry? Do you think

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I've always thought that a rather traditional education is a very good
                    background, provides a very good background for the Foreign Service. And whether
                    that includes a study of classical thought, classical literature, Latin, is
                    something else again. There's no real need for it, but certainly, I think, Latin
                    provides an intellectual challenge and discipline, as does philosophy. And I
                    would suggest that if somebody felt the need for training and intellectual
                    discipline, philosophy, logic would be one way to go without wasting three
                    years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, it isn't, unfortunately. It's not a question with which I feel easy.
                    You either give a glib answer or you give a terribly earnest and labored answer
                    which conceals a great deal more than it reveals. I think I'll pass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'll pass on that one, fine. Did you enjoy living

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I've always enjoyed living abroad, but I've always particularly enjoyed
                    coming back home again. I was very careful throughout most of my career to see
                    to it that after every overseas assignment, I came back to Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I tend to say more the problems shared by all single people, trying to
                    find the time to locate housing, trying to unpack, trying to establish some kind
                    of acceptable household routine that didn't burden you too greatly, but did
                    permit you to do some of the official entertaining that you had to do. But
                    single people have the same problems.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>HEALY: Not really. The first time I left home to go overseas, I was so excited by
                    the challenge that I don't recollect being homesick, although I was aware of the
                    fact that I was missing certain family occasions, and that made me a little bit
                    unhappy. The only time I can remember questioning whether I was doing the right
                    thing is at the end of my first home leave. I'd been in the Foreign Service two
                    years and I was leaving by plane to go back to Italy for another two years, and
                    that was when I can remember sitting on the airplane thinking do I really want
                    to keep on going through these good-byes and spending a couple of years away
                    from my family? But after the next two years in Italy, I came back to Washington
                    and realized that the challenge of the job was fascinating and that everybody
                    leaves home eventually. You just cannot go back. So I came to terms with
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very adult approach. Did you find that you had different
                        work habits when you were abroad than you had in the States? Not so much
                        habits, because I know you're a hard worker no matter where you are, but in
                        the way you functioned? Did you find you had to be more aggressive in the
                        States, is what I'm trying to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No. No, I don't recollect noticing any difference. The only slight
                    difference that might have existed would be that in dealing with Americans,
                    whether overseas or in Washington, you can be pretty straightforward. You don't
                    have to ask yourself whether you are transgressing certain cultural mores or
                    whether you might give the impression of being a brash, fast-talking American,
                    not so much a woman, just a brash, fast-talking American. Generally speaking
                    when I dealt with foreigners overseas, I was very careful to be sure to observe
                    any courtesies of which I was aware in dealing with them, because I realized I
                    was not in my home environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes, yes. That's a good point. Do you think frequent
                        service abroad helps or impedes progress to becoming a chief of mission?
                        Better to be here or better to be there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: You can't make a yes or no answer to that question. You're in the Foreign
                    Service; you must serve overseas. There is no such thing as a foreign service
                    officer who has served only overseas or only in Washington. There are many who
                    would say that you make your career in both places, and with them I would agree.
                    There are others who would say you have to pull political strings and the
                    strings of personal relationships in Washington in order to obtain a chief of
                    mission assignment. I don't know about that. I was stationed overseas when
                    Washington telephoned to say that I had been selected for the Freetown
                    assignment. I certainly didn't pull any strings.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a movement that I understand is happening now,
                        where people don't want to go abroad as much anymore, and I wondered how you
                        felt about that, whether or not they were right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Well, things have changed. I know that twenty years ago I was one of the
                    few people who always wanted a Washington assignment after a foreign assignment.
                    Many of the families were perfectly willing to go from one foreign assignment to
                    another, for financial reasons because it was easier to manage financially
                    overseas on a very low salary than it was back in Washington. That has changed
                    under the impact of women's rights and a changing and more hostile environment
                    overseas. Now there are instances where, perhaps, some people are making the
                    decision that they do not want to serve overseas, and particularly not in
                    certain areas because of the dangers represented. Others are making the decision
                    that at this particular time in the life of the family an overseas assignment is
                    wrong because of schooling difficulties for their children...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were a woman, did you find much...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Your question puzzles me. I don't know quite what you mean by part of the
                    action. You mean part of the action in the embassy, or part of the action
                    vis-�-vis the foreign officials with whom I worked?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good point. Actually it has two prongs, one, in
                        the embassy were you able to be given substantive, interesting jobs, and
                        number two, if you did have a substantive job, such as reporting, were you
                        able to get the appropriate response from the people you were dealing
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Yes, this touches on something I thought we'd discussed earlier. The only
                    time I felt out of the action was in my first year in the Foreign Service when I
                    was part of a fairly large staff at the consulate general in Naples. There I
                    think part of the problem may have been the fact that the refugee relief program
                    was winding down and we were somewhat overstaffed for a period there until the
                    department could get around to transferring people out, as I was eventually
                    transferred out to Milan, after just the one year. But certainly I felt that I
                    was on the periphery of what was happening, but that may have been simply
                    because the refugee program was winding down.</p>
                <p>From then on, I did not have that feeling within the office or outside because I
                    had very specifically defined responsibilities that went with my job. Those
                    responsibilities were mine. I did not have to seize them, I did not have to
                    fight anybody else for them, they were by definition part of my job. When it
                    came to my reporting responsibilities, whether they were political or economic,
                    they too were very clearly defined.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>And when it came to working with people outside the office, as I've said, the
                    title you carry with you is one that nobody can ignore because you have the full
                    weight of your embassy behind you. I never did run into anybody who ignored the
                    fact that I was the second secretary of embassy, for example, calling on
                    somebody at the foreign ministry on a matter of business. They received me for
                    what I was, the official representative of my embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, is it a fair statement to say that in your opinion
                        the job title and the role that you play and the title you're given
                        outweighs any considerations of sex or gender?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: In my experience and in the countries in which I have served, my answer
                    would be yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: But I have served in western European countries. I have served in New
                    Zealand, and I have served in West Africa. And the answer that somebody, a
                    woman, might give whose experience had been in Latin America or in the Middle
                    East or in some parts of Asia, I simply do not know. I was very fortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel any impact of the woman's movement on your
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It's hard for me to be precise about that for the very reason that if I
                    questioned a certain assignment, nobody was going to say, “You're being given
                    that assignment because you're a woman” because that in itself would probably be
                    a violation of regulation or whatever. But yes, there were certainly times when
                    I felt, this would be probably more in the late seventies, when I felt that I
                    had been given an assignment against my wishes because of feeling in the
                    Department of State that the administration needed a woman in that office in
                    order to deflect criticism on the part of the women's movement. I'm thinking in
                    particular of an assignment from the National War College to the Board of
                    Examiners. I did not particularly want the assignment and I think we have
                    discussed this already.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we have.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>HEALY: I did not want the assignment but I gathered, and nobody, of course, would
                    be precise about this because it would probably be actionable, I gathered that I
                    was being assigned to the Board of Examiners because the people in personnel
                    felt it important to place a woman in that particular office to avoid criticism
                    that we were not including women in the recruitment process. As it turned out,
                    as I've already said, it was a very happy year and I cannot complain.</p>
                <p>But there have been other instances where assignments had been proposed which I
                    judged, perhaps incorrectly, which I judged were for the same purpose. In other
                    words, I was a fig leaf, or I was a flag to be flown to indicate that the
                    department's heart was in the right place because, lo and behold, they had
                    assigned a woman to this particular position. Whether or not it played a part in
                    my selection for ambassadorship, I cannot tell. I was in New Zealand at the
                    time. Certainly I questioned, I do ask myself, “Did it play a role?” and I don't
                    know what answer to come up with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then your feeling of this impact of the women's
                        movement has been to a large extent negative, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, I wouldn't say negative, because for all I know, my selection for
                    Sierra Leone was entirely due to the fact that I was a woman. I don't like to
                    think that. I like to think that 27 years of doing what I think of as a very
                    good job in the Foreign Service earned me that assignment. But I do have to
                    raise the question. Was it a factor, and I have to say it could very likely have
                    been a factor. So on the one hand, yes, I have been given assignments or I have
                    been proposed for assignments that I didn't want because I was a woman, and on
                    the other hand, perhaps I've received assignments I wanted also because I was a
                    woman. So positive or negative, I can't play it all out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Did the fact of women's liberation have any effect
                        on your views of yourself? Did you feel at all liberated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, I mean I know who I am and I've more or less always known who I am. I
                    would charge right ahead and do whatever I felt was something I wanted to do.
                    And the fact that women's liberation came along has not changed me in that
                    sense.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any feelings that there were social
                        expectations that you couldn't go beyond, such as in a job you could not
                        picture yourself as giving orders to men underneath you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No. I was in effect professionalized by the Foreign Service, so what I saw
                    being done at higher levels was automatically assumed by me to be the way I
                    would act when I reached those higher levels. I made no distinction as between
                    male and female because I've had female bosses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At other posts did any sex-connected views impinge on the
                        way you lived? You were mostly in Europe, but you were in Italy which is
                        supposed to be very male chauvinistic, were there any things you had to
                        change there, places to visit, dress codes, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No. I'm a very modest person. I was brought up by the nuns and socialized
                    in my religion. Since I tend to be a very retiring person anyway, I never had to
                    modify my behavior, nor was it ever a problem overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Have you known of many instances where in families
                        the daughter was expected to make the sacrifices with obligations to elderly
                        parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: You're moving into an area with which I'm unfamiliar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're unfamiliar with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Are you talking about foreign service families?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: I wouldn't know. I just don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Many foreign service women have had to assume the
                        care of their mothers, for example. Another one had to give up her career to
                        go home and take care of a sick sister.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That would have to be a person's own decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It's not something you're familiar with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>HEALY: Not really. I can't think of any instances where I remember saying, what a
                    shame so and so has just given up a brilliant career in order to do something
                    for the family. I probably am not inclined to think in those terms. Who knows
                    what you're giving up? It might or might not have been a brilliant career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's true.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: The fact that you are doing something you feel is right for a member of
                    your family is quite admirable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel a woman DCM or ambassador does the job in the
                        way a man does?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: We're talking about individuals. I can't make generalizations about men
                    and women as DCMs or ambassadors because we're talking about a very small group
                    of people and everybody is different and individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you feel about a female DCM for yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It wouldn't trouble me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wouldn't trouble you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Good heavens, no!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about a male secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: That wouldn't trouble me either. I believe Anne Martindell had a male
                    secretary in New Zealand. This is a little bit vague in my mind because I think
                    it was only the latter part of - it would probably be within months of my own
                    departure - but I do recollect that there was a male secretary there. But it
                    wouldn't trouble me to have a male secretary just so long as he did a highly
                    competent job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. You can remember back to when you were a very junior
                        officer, when you went to social events, receptions, did men ever seek your
                        opinions and listen to you, or did you find yourself off in a corner with
                        the women?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>HEALY: No, I did make a special point to see to it that that didn't happen. If I
                    found myself in a corner with a group of women who were talking non-essentials,
                    I can find that quite pleasant, number one, but number two, if I became
                    sensitive to the fact that the males were grouping in one area and the females
                    in another, I would try quietly, without making a point of it, I would try to
                    move myself perhaps by taking another women with me over toward a male grouping
                    and try to enter the conversation there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. One last question. How would you describe your
                        energy level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: It's pretty high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess it would really have to be to carry out all of the
                        different roles in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: No, I would tend to say there are many women who are homemakers and
                    mothers and workers and their energy level must be incredibly high too, or else
                    they're always tired, one or the other. I just find I do have a good bit of
                    energy, a good deal of physical energy, and this is one reason why I found
                    tennis to be a very useful sport, because it takes up some of my physical
                    energy, which work does not. In other words, the mental work that you do in the
                    office is not physically tiring enough for me. I have to add to it something
                    that is physical, and that is tennis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you able to do it now? Has your back problem cleared
                        up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Thank goodness. It appears to be. Of course losing the weight is
                    helping.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I didn't realize that you had been heavier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: Oh, yes, the more weight I lose, the easier it becomes to move. I still
                    have trouble of course, but I'm playing tennis again, and able to play tennis,
                    and that was something that the doctor did not predict two years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: He said that I would not be able to play tennis again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HEALY: Yes, I'm pleased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very, very much, Terry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEALY: You're welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been very helpful.</hi>
