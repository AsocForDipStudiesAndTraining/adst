                <p>Interviewed by: Sue Swanson</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 27, 1990</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Sue Swanson today's date is Friday, July 27, 1990.
                        I am interviewing Anne Daly for the foreign service spouse oral history
                        project at my home in Reston, Virginia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Okay Anne what I would like you to talk about now is I would like you to give us
                    a brief introduction to how you got into the life of living overseas and that
                    would start with the military for you.</p>
                <p>DALY: Well actually, yes with the military, with the Department of the Navy, but
                    my husband was a civilian. We were not active duty military which again puts us
                    on sort of a periphery. The civilian with the Navy is a second class citizen of
                    a sort. Our first time out was to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in 1968 after a 6-month
                    separation. He had to go first to get on the housing list and we were told three
                    weeks. Six months later he came back, so we were in our townhouse in New York,
                    Westchester County, with the two kids, who at that time were five and three,
                    four and two and a half I guess and we talked to him by ham operator. He used
                    the military mars system, which means he calls to a ham operator who picks it up
                    somewhere in our area. So I would get phone calls from some man in Pennsylvania,
                    New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and we would then spend a few minutes talking
                    to each other and the kids. And the kids learned to say, “I love you Daddy,
                    over.” If we forgot the over, the poor man taking the call for us would have to
                    butt in and say, “Excuse me but do you want me to put over on that?” and so our
                    private conversations had a certain inhibition to them and then he came back and
                    then we had our first move out. We spent two years in Guantanamo, which is a lot
                    of isolation and we came back to New York we were reassigned back to New York.
                    Then we were to be reassigned to Beirut in '73, but it blew up at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Literally.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DALY: Literally and so we were instead sent to Panama. Panama at that time with
                    the Navy Department meant that we lived in the Panama Canal Zone, in Navy
                    housing, and this was before the treaty, but in time for periodic riots in the
                    city leading up to an eventual treaty. It was a very good time for our children
                    because they were still in elementary school and at that time the Panama Canal
                    Zone was like perfect little small town and then you could also go out into the
                    city, which we enjoyed, for shopping and whatever and traveling. We drove to
                    Costa Rica in time for a conference of all of the regional Secretaries of State
                    equivalent and Henry Kissinger was in our hotel. We had just been getting out of
                    Panama after a rather tense period for my husband looking forward to a real
                    relaxing vacation only to reach our hotel and be stopped and had to identify
                    ourselves and where is your key and guards all around the hotel and our room
                    because of this conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't quite as relaxing as you thought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Well once we got used to it, it was fine and then we drove back. So, Panama
                    at that time was a very good period for us. We were transferred from there,
                    still with the Navy, to Japan. My husband's office was located in the Navy base
                    in Yokosuka, which is about 40 miles south of Tokyo. We found a house 10 miles
                    from the base and across the bay so that we had a two-story, pre-World War II
                    Japanese house standing on a bluff looking out at Sagami bay and we could open
                    the curtains in the morning and say good morning to Mount Fuji or Fuji-san and
                    he would then disappear, he's a he — the mountain is a he, and he would
                    disappear into the pollution by 10 o'clock in the morning and reappear about 5
                    o'clock in the evening so when my husband got home we could walk out on the
                    bluff and say good evening to Fuji and we lived over a fishing co-op. We thought
                    our yard was our yard until we came home in sea weed season. There are no fish
                    in there and the fishermen's coastal catch half the year is octopus and the
                    other half of the year it's seaweed. They would bring the seaweed in and have to
                    dry it. The big pieces were, we thought, our lawn so we got to know the
                    fishermen. Our son, at the time, was about 11 or 12 in there and he would come
                    in from school, take off his American-type sneakers and put on his Japanese
                    workman's shoes — the tabi with the split toe and run down to the dock. If he
                    had the tabi on they would give him a line and put him to work with the octopus
                    or the seaweed, if he wore his sneakers they ignored him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DALY: Yeah, Japan was probably the most interesting but physically the most
                    difficult place we've lived, while we took language lessons, which we had to
                    have, I was the only western woman in our neighborhood during the week and so if
                    we were to eat I had to know some Japanese. Because we were off the beaten track
                    the signs were all in Japanese characters not in our type not in western
                    lettering, so not only couldn't you speak the language you couldn't sound it
                    out, you couldn't read it. I have never felt so dumb in my life as in Japan, but
                    also it was a lovely time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were only there a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: A year and a half moving toward two when we found out that, this was during
                    Jimmy Carter's presidency, and they were looking to cut the budget. Admiral
                    Bobby Inman came up with a wonderful suggestion to close out my husband's
                    unit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then your husband was looking for a job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Well in Japan, no. We first had to pack up and leave Japan with now two
                    teenage children and return to stay with his mother in Connecticut while he
                    looked for another job. That's rather traumatic for a man to be at that point
                    about 40 and two teenagers and no job. He very quickly did get connected with
                    the Agency for International Development and with his background — he had been
                    in Navy intelligence first and then he had this unit that was put out of
                    business that was a different clandestine unit for the Navy. Seemed a logical
                    place to go was the Inspector General's Office of AID where he is still an
                    investigator with the IG, but it took some months before all the paper
                    processing as we all know the swift wheels of the government. So he was
                    literally without a job for a period of 5 months I think. We were in limbo in
                    Connecticut not knowing where we were going to go. Once he signed the papers,
                    signed on with AID, we were in Karachi, Pakistan 6 weeks later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Six weeks later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Six weeks after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in '77?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DALY: This was in '77. We had one week in Washington. This was going to be my —
                    what Cuba, Panama, Japan, Pakistan — fourth country and this was the first time
                    I had been offered anything in the way of orientation. AID paid for me to
                    accompany him to Washington for a week's orientation. Luckily we still had a
                    grandmother who took care of the children and we took advantage of that week,
                    seeing films about Pakistan and ladies telling me about AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sponsored through AID not the State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: This was AID, that's correct and they never mentioned OBC. There was no CLO
                    yet, there was an OBC. My husband found OBC in going over and getting language
                    tapes because he speaks Spanish and he didn't want to loose his Spanish language
                    capability so he was getting tapes to take with him to Pakistan to keep up the
                    Spanish and he found OBC and took me over there. I have since prostratized at
                    AID for people to do this. That was really nice and the moving time we found a
                    big difference in terms of — we felt much better taken care of by AID than we
                    had with the military. The military was lower contract movers for starters and
                    when we were overseas we were much more on our own. With AID when we got to
                    Pakistan we had at least a very small community because we were in Karachi not
                    Islamabad so it was a very small group down there that was not the embassy where
                    we had the mission it was the consul general and the only AID people there were
                    the IG, the IG auditors and the IG investigators. The AID mission was in
                    Islamabad. We had a good school and life in Karachi centered on the school.
                    There was nothing else or not much else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So a good family life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: It was the best family post we've ever had. I was the regular school
                    substitute in the high school for the junior high and the senior high, except
                    for math. I also was elected to the school board. I was the only woman on it so
                    therefore by fiat I was the Secretary, but the other people on the board made
                    for a very interesting time for us because they brought in the different
                    segments of the school: we had the American business community, the oil
                    companies and the bankers, and we had the international business community. We
                    had the head of Air France on the board for a while and I have forgotten who the
                    other one was and then we had one of the leaders of the Pakistani community, so
                    it was a very international group. In that sense it made for the nicest social
                    circle we had. It was the broadest in terms of the different people that were
                    brought into it as a normal course of things and then I was re-elected to the
                    board. I served two full years and was re-elected for a third time, however it
                    didn't mean anything because we were evacuated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you tell us what happened then I mean
                        historically we know the basics but you can certainly go over them now and
                        how it affected you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DALY: It was a month after the hostages had been taken in Iran. We were all
                    concerned about that so security was very much on everyone's mind, but not
                    particularly in terms of any personal threat in Karachi, however, Khomeini was
                    broadcasting throughout the Arab world. His tapes were going throughout the Arab
                    world and then it was the time of the hajj. There was a shooting inside Mecca,
                    inside the Ka'bah the sacred sanctuary in Saudi Arabia in which westerners were
                    killed and there were shootings and immediately it came on the radio throughout
                    Pakistan that it was American CIA killing hajj pilgrims and immediate riots
                    followed. I have never spoken to anyone to find out, or nobody has ever told me,
                    we have never been privy to whatever the findings were when everything was over.
                    The spontaneous riots occurred within 20 minutes of each other in Islamabad,
                    Karachi, and then the third city of — now I can't even think of it — but four
                    cities in Pakistan had these spontaneous riots within 20 minutes of each other.
                    Many of the rioters arrived on the scene by government bus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it seemed pretty obvious that it was orchestrated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: In Karachi it did. In Islamabad it was so bad: the entire embassy being
                    burned down, so many of the people being caught in the vault and coming within
                    minutes of dying, and two people dying (two Americans) and two Pakistanis, the
                    kids being threatened at the school. In Karachi we felt guilty even saying that
                    we had had any problems, but the rioting in Karachi was bad in that they were
                    within minutes of breaking into the consulate. The Karachi city police finally
                    intervened. We don't know why they didn't in the other cities, but they finally
                    did in Karachi. It was determined from Washington that we would be evacuated.
                    This was the day before Thanksgiving.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your family was at school and at work and you were home or
                        were you spread around when all of this occurred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: My husband's job means he travels.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was out of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Yes. He is on frequent and lengthy TDYs, which has always been an
                    interesting topic. He was in Damascus and of course Damascus was involved in it
                    too. The children were in school on a Wednesday and I knew something was up when
                    I saw a Pakistani Army jeep with armed soldiers stopping in front of my house
                    followed by my children coming out of their school bus. They were escorted from
                    school.</p>

                        coming home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: No. At this point we knew nothing. There were no radios in houses at this
                    time. There was no call from the consulate. No, we did not know. The kids
                    arrived with Army escort and they were quite excited by the whole thing. I was
                    due to go for Thanksgiving to the Regional Marine Officer's home. We would
                    circle around and someone was the duty father and he was the duty father for
                    Thanksgiving. My daughter's birthday had been just a few weeks before and we had
                    saved this long weekend for her to have a slumber party following the
                    Thanksgiving celebration. So I had the next morning a pot of spaghetti sauce and
                    meatballs for her slumber party. I was making apple pie and cole slaw for
                    Thanksgiving and I got a call at 9 o'clock in the morning from the wife of the
                    Regional Marine Officer telling me that we were going to be evacuated sometime
                    over that weekend and that she would continue to have the Thanksgiving dinner
                    because it was already in process but that her husband was not there to be duty
                    father because, of course, he had to fly up to Islamabad — he lost a marine up
                    there as well as an Army Warrant Officer. Then I got a call from the school,
                    from the Superintendent, we would have to hold an emergency School Board meeting
                    too because what were we going to do about the school and the teachers. We had
                    male servants over there. We had a male house servant who with the kids I set
                    them to packing the air freight and hauling out the winter coats to air out the
                    moth balls and pull out the suitcases to pack and the air freight and to pull
                    one out for my husband because he wasn't there and it was November and it was
                    cold in Washington. So we had winter cloths with us for just such a happening
                    and had to pack a suitcase for him. He wears a size 13 shoe so they are heavy to
                    drag. I went to the School Board meeting, which lasted 3 hours, during which
                    time we were trying to get more information from the Con Gen as to what was
                    happening and it was still that we were going home and they would not advise the
                    business community they would simply say that the government people were going
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Karachi was being evacuated more on a threat from
                        Islamabad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Well the riots had been pretty bad and nobody knew what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But no personal attacks on Americans in Islamabad or on
                        the Con Gen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Correct. In Islamabad yes. In Karachi no one was hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The private business people were upset that Con Gen was
                        leaving, the people from the Con Gen were leaving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: The Con Gen himself stayed as did several people were told to stay, but the
                    familieand most of the employees were out.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think they felt definitely just abandoned by
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: They felt angry. They didn't want the Con Gen to make the decision for
                    them, they did hope for a little more information from him to give them some
                    insight into why this decision was being made for us so that they could then
                    make a more informed decision instead of basing their decision on the fact
                    simply we were leaving. Not knowing whether this was a political gesture or
                    whether it was a gesture for security. At any rate we decided to close the
                    school and send the teachers to Bangkok, which I was quite upset because I had
                    to go to Washington and I would have much rather gone to Bangkok. Most of the
                    business community sent their families to Athens. Most of the employees stayed
                    in Karachi and the families went to Athens or Bangkok. I then went home, checked
                    the suitcases, finished my suitcase and the air freight, and picked up the cole
                    slaw and the apple pie and went over to the Marine Officer's home for this awful
                    dinner. One of the other women there for dinner, her husband was with an
                    auditor's group up in Islamabad and at that time we did not know what had
                    happened. We found out later that they of course were the group that were taken
                    hostage and held for several hours and were very brutally treated. Sharon, the
                    Marine Officer's wife, got a phone call from the Con Gen's office that she would
                    be going out on the plane on the next day. This was I guess Thursday because it
                    was Thanksgiving. She was due to go out on Friday. Well I have Anne Daly here
                    and her children do you know when they are going out. It is now about 6 o'clock
                    in the evening and they said, “Oh, oh yes she's on the list to go out
                    tonight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh NO!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: She's to be at the commissary parking lot by 8 o'clock. So, I picked up the
                    kids, we drove home, slammed the bags closed, picked up the coats, and got in
                    the car. I had to drive our car to the commissary parking lot, which was about 6
                    miles away through neighborhoods and over the main street and we were wondering
                    what's going to happen. We got there and got on the brand new school bus — the
                    bright yellow, American-style — big yellow school bus that said Karachi American
                    School on it and drove the miles — I have forgotten how many miles — to the
                    airport in full public view with people sitting along the sides of the streets
                    going yeah yeah, smiling. The plane we went out on brought in the aid people who
                    had been up in Islamabad that day and brought them back, all except one who had
                    been beaten enough that they kept him for a while. The others came on the plane
                    with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To stay in Karachi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: No to get out of Karachi. Pan Am brought a plane from Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: They took a plane out of their line flew it up to Islamabad and picked up
                    everybody in Islamabad brought them down and picked us up in Karachi then flew
                    us into Paris where they had an air controller's strike. So, we were in Paris
                    for 24 hours where we could do nothing but stay at the George Pompidou hotel
                    that was out there by the airport. Then when we finally flew out on an Air
                    France plane, that treated us beautifully, we ended up in New York where we were
                    overnighted in a perfectly dreadful airport motel. I had to let people know,
                    family there know, that we were coming back and I couldn't stop in New York
                    where we had some family and we flew on to Washington the next day. We were the
                    first plane out and the last to arrive in Washington. Took us 3 days. They took
                    us all to a hotel — the Sheraton National — over by the Navy Annex on 395 and
                    they had everybody there. There was CLO, Janet Lloyd, and the Iran group had
                    formed an evacuation committee, the women had formed a group and the Pakistani
                    evacuees formed an immediate PAKEVAC group. They brought in a social worker and
                    they brought in — Elmore Rigamer had stayed out in, the psychiatrist, he had
                    been out in that area that was his territory and he stayed — but they had a
                    psychiatric social worker at the hotel immediately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that social worker was of use.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Oh, she was wonderful. We had a lot of the students from Islamabad who were
                    in pretty bad shape and felt really threatened. A couple had been hurt trying to
                    jump over walls and get hyper on the whole thing. The people who had been beaten
                    up and three of the women, two of them with their children with little children,
                    had been urinated on by the people that had grabbed them. They were going
                    through all kinds of psychological displacement at being pulled out. The lady —
                    whose name I can't remember — and I think she's still on the staff at State was
                    absolutely wonderful. We were all forming our own little comfort groups and gong
                    from one to the other and wondering where our husbands were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had not heard from Ralph at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>DALY: No. By the time I got back his Washington boss did get in touch with me, in
                    fact he came over to the hotel and he had sent world to have Ralph come out. My
                    husband got back 3 days after me I think. His boss went out to the airport with
                    me to pick him up and the man, he was single at the time, brought a supermarket
                    brown paper bag to the airport for my husband in which he had a sweater, long
                    sleeve shirt, some extra underwear just in case my husband didn't have any warm
                    cloths coming out of Damascus. It was really very sweet. It was an extremely
                    hectic time. It was wonderfully educational in retrospect having everything that
                    was going on afterwards. I wouldn't want to go through it again necessarily. We
                    spent 3 months in temporary quarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here in Washington, DC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: At the magnificent Clarendon Court.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what did it all cost?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: There were some 300 families came out of Pakistan and over the next 3 weeks
                    they brought out more from the other Middle East countries. So all of the
                    temporary housing in the Washington area was pretty well used and all of us with
                    no knowledge of what was going to happen — whether we were going to go back in 2
                    weeks or not at all. Our children at that time had to go immediately into
                    Washington and Lee High School and we did not want them or I did not want them
                    in a constant state of flux for too long. Did we rent a place, did we buy a
                    place, what? We were in this temporary situation. So we put in for whatever came
                    open and 3 months later we were back in Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went back to Panama?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DALY: But this time with AID. So, this time we lived in the city rather than in
                    the zone and this time the treaty was beginning to be put into effect. The
                    Ambassador was Ambler Moss who had been one of the negotiators for the treaty
                    and we all thought he was given the Ambassadorship because he was the only one
                    that understood the terms of the treaty. He was working very hard on it. The
                    kids enjoyed being back. They met friends that they had known before. Friends
                    who are still friends. It was almost a good time, but my husband had serious
                    surgery while we were there. He was hospitalized for over a month. Then low and
                    behold we had budget cuts again and while he didn't loose his job again the
                    office was closed again and after being there for less than 2 years we were
                    reassigned back to Washington. Our children did 4 high schools in less than 3
                    years on 4 continents and we came back with our son going into his senior year
                    and our daughter into her junior year and that's not to be wished on anybody.
                    They did fine. I mean they graduated from high school. Our son has suffered from
                    the cut offs, the moves, the jerks, and I think the worry to have it happen to
                    have the move happen at the same time his father was sick, he was 16 years old,
                    was difficult. He hasn't gotten into any trouble, nothing like that, but he went
                    to college and he still has no degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has trouble finishing what he starts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Yes, yes. Charming, fit in any company, delightful company. Charming young
                    man doing very well working a very nice job, but not finished. Our daughter, on
                    the other hand, is bound and determined that things will fit in their place and
                    if she wants to do something she will work through it. It's a bit interesting to
                    watch them. They are both delightful people. There are costs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This may be true though had you not moved at all he may
                        just never have, you never know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Of course. That's the what if.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you have two obviously different personalitied
                        children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Oh, yes. Who are best friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that's nice. Well they had each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>DALY: They did. Of course we then went to Manila without them. Timing being
                    everything, ours has not been good. Our longest tour ever was here in Washington
                    for slightly over four years with the two children finishing high school and
                    going through college. The very time you'd really like overseas, with an
                    allowance, we were here. But then we did go to Manila leaving them behind, which
                    was the first time we've been without them and that's mixed. Kind of fun
                    actually. As long as you have telephone connections and somebody for them to go
                    to. That's I think another cost the State Department shares with the military.
                    They expect you to come equipped with grandparents or brothers in the States to
                    pick up your end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or don't have children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Or don't have children because home leave, which seems to be so marvelous
                    on the surface puts you in an economic hole if you have to rent a car and rent
                    an apartment or house it's not a vacation. Difficult to save that amount of
                    money, but if you have a grandparent at the ready and we ran out of
                    grandparents. That's another, it's not a cost in terms of again that's something
                    that's going to happen no matter where you are, it's just maybe a little bit
                    harder that you don't have the time with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right and something you regret.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: It's something your children don't have, the time with them. That would
                    have been nice to have and so I always push for having your grandparents visit
                    because I think children need grandparents. I've watched it with ours at college
                    on weekends when we've gone down and the parents come down bringing the
                    grandparents and their friends who are used to having grandparents around kind
                    of ignore the grandparents. And there we find our children escorting the
                    grandparents and sitting and talking to them because ours enjoy being around
                    grandparents. They didn't have a whole lot of it and they seek them out, which
                    is nice for the grandparents too because they've got a new audience. So I
                    totally encourage staying with them and visiting with them and having them come
                    visit overseas, which we did. My husband's mother and stepfather were able to
                    visit us in two countries, which was great.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Manila,</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: We arrived May 5th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this was about the time of the Marcos revolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DALY: That's right. My husband went out Monday after Easter Sunday, the day after
                    Easter. Cory [Aquino] had come in. The February revolution was over, but nobody
                    knew what was going to happen. I was teaching here, so he went out in April. I
                    stayed to finish the school year and do the packing and see to the kids at
                    school and make the arrangements for them to be covered while we left and I
                    joined him at the end of June. My school was over and I was going anyway and
                    things looked fairly quiet in Manila at that time. Six weeks later I was
                    teaching out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Brent School.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: At Brent School, which was an interesting if not a happy year. Brent School
                    is an old institution, but it was moved to Manila. It was in its third year when
                    I taught there and was going through administrative difficulties, which spilled
                    over to the teachers. The students were great. There was always no problem with
                    the students, it's the administration so that flux was fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that it was good in that you were teaching
                        with more of an international group of teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Well, I've done that before. There, yes, the teachers were very few
                    Americans, several Canadians and British, and mostly Filipino. In Karachi the
                    teachers were almost all American with a couple of Pakistanis and a couple of
                    Irish and I think one Canadian. In Cuba it was mixed it was a DOD [Department of
                    Defense] so it was mainly American, but they had a few local hires. In Panama it
                    was again mostly American, but assorted. There were always others to bring in to
                    widen the theme. Teaching in an international setting was something that I was
                    used to and liked and thoroughly enjoyed, but one year there was more than
                    enough. There was an opportunity to do a space study in the embassy, which I was
                    given the contract for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking you employ the space, not outer space.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Yes, physical space. I think you pointed me to the GSO and I think he was
                    very happy to have a non-State Department spouse do this because not being too
                    sure what was happening it was much nicer to have somebody from a little bit of
                    the outside that they couldn't directly blame. Again, it gave me a wonderful
                    opportunity to get inside an embassy in effect and meet the people as an AID
                    spouse we don't normally do. In fact, before I went in to begin the work on this
                    space study I had been inside the embassy building only once and that was to get
                    my ID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up an interesting point that I wanted to talk
                        to you a little bit more about. What you perceive the differences are
                        between State and AID. I know that you have a small post to choose from with
                        Karachi and then of course Manila and I know Panama is probably a mixed
                        bag.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Probably a middling size I think. It very much depends upon the people who
                    are at any post no matter what the size. Even at a very large post, it only
                    takes one or two people to poison the atmosphere and to set the tone. It seems
                    to very much depend upon what the Ambassador wants or the DCM or his wife and
                    what the AID Mission Director may want or whoever is the chief AID person. If
                    there is an intent by any combination of those people — the direction does seem
                    to come from the top — to mix, to make some attempt to get to know everybody at
                    post, it can work very well. The separation seems to — there definitely is a
                    separation — there's an attitudinal difference. The function of the State
                    Department is different than the function of AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dare you be more specific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: The State Department is dealing on the level of overt diplomacy, of policy
                    issues dealing with the direct counterparts in the host government. AID
                    personnel are hired for in many instances specific skills, technical skills,
                    engineering, economists are hired to work with the economists in the government
                    to make it work not to discuss its policy. The AID people tend to be more
                    technocratically, their attitude is more in a technical line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Their jobs usually take them out of where the embassy may be into the whole
                    of the country to work, to supervise, to direct, to organize projects. They work
                    much more with the peasants, the natives, the poor levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The working class.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: The working class, the poor levels of whatever country they're going into.
                    AID doesn't go to Europe yet — yet. Manila is considered the best post in AID,
                    which for many State Department people consider it, well now it's a hardship
                    post for anybody. But prior to the last couple of years AID people considered it
                    the best post they could get where State Department people tend to look at it as
                    a hardship post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just do things differently.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>DALY: They are coming from a different set of priorities and as a result of that
                    the AID people get involved in dealing with their counterparts who are
                    engineers, teachers, water survey people, they're ditch diggers in many
                    instances and they're going out to build a dam and they bring these people home.
                    The wives tend to get a little defensive I think in terms of when they'll hear
                    the State Department wives talk about representational funds or getting paid for
                    representational parties that can tend to get some AID wives a little defensive
                    because there is no such thing as representational funds. The mission director
                    usually has some, but not very much and yet most of them do a great deal of
                    entertaining and entertaining of the people of the country that they're living
                    in. They love it. There is a very big Peace Corps mentality in a lot of AID
                    people in terms of reaching out and getting involved with the people with whom
                    they work. So these differences sometimes don't mean a thing and a lot of times
                    they can cause trouble and that's where it comes to how the personnel interact
                    at the post. I think in Manila we had a very pleasant arrangement for the most
                    part in terms of working to get the people together and maybe that was because
                    everybody felt after a period of time, as the threat levels increased, there
                    seemed to be less sense of us and them — embassy and AID or any of the other
                    agencies. We had 28 agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They pulled together more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: There was more of a sense that we did need to know everybody, we were
                    responsible for each other. Our kids did go to the same school and we did begin
                    to get more cross jobs for the spouses. I think that opened it up too. We had
                    some State Department wives working for AID. We had AID spouses working in the
                    embassy. We focus on AID because I'm an AID spouse and also because the AID
                    machine is so big. I don't think the USIS people felt separate I think they are
                    pretty much incorporated they don't have that sense of apartness. Some of the
                    other smaller agencies do. More so than AID. AID has a lot of AID around it to
                    help to support it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AID has been around for a long time too like USIS. Even
                        though they fall under the umbrella of the embassy they have their own
                        specific</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Their goals are different I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Goals, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DALY: There has also been a feeling, there's an historic antipathy that is built
                    in. In some posts if all of the agencies come under one GSO there is no way you
                    are going to convince the other agency people, AID or any of the other agencies,
                    that they are being treated as well as State Department people. If you go to a
                    post where AID is much larger than State and there are several of those in
                    Africa there is no way you are going to convince the State people that they are
                    being treated as well as the AID people. So these differences in the agencies
                    because there are differences in the regulations and every time you are living
                    close together in what is in essence a very small town relationship the
                    differences become magnified and each thinks the other is getting something
                    better than they have. Oh I know I did when we switched from the military to
                    AID. We were definitely treated better. That's where the atmospherics come in,
                    in terms of who your community tone setters are. If the complaining tone takes
                    over, you've got a miserable post. If you have a couple of people who can be
                    positive and laugh about things and get people to work together on committees,
                    to get people out of the cafeteria, out of the club, away from just the bridge
                    table — play bridge, but not just bridge, and get them to work on some kind of
                    positive, even if it's only volunteer, and get them some credit for their
                    volunteer work, and get them to feel as though they're doing something that
                    makes a difference, the whole tone of the community can change, and some
                    recognition for what they've done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: If the Ambassador is willing to sign letters that the CLO writes and they
                    have something for their resume it makes a great deal of difference. It means
                    something to people to get recognition, when we have people who have worked on
                    volunteer committees 3 or 4 years and the only recognition they've gotten is
                    from newer people saying, “What do they know about this, who are they?” and
                    nobody has said a showable thank you. A verbal thank you is nice, but a written
                    one means a lot. It's been interesting.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You became the CLO in Manila.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Succeeding you. For 6 months going around say, “I know Sue's not here, I
                    know Sue's not here.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>DALY: Was the consciousness of the difference.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DALY: It was very much a part of — in all the posts that we've been in, my
                    husband's job has left us as being kind of peripheral, a little bit outside of
                    things. His being with the IG does not make him beloved of everybody in AID and
                    so we are not necessarily a part — we're a regional office — we're not part of
                    the mission. It depends upon the mission as to how you're treated there. So, in
                    all of these jobs I have been conscious of being an outsider. So to come into
                    the CLO job my goal was not only did I not want to feel like an outsider, it was
                    to try with as much effort as possible include as many people as we could into
                    whatever we were doing and that was our goal. To some extent it works. Nothing
                    was perfect, in fact probably some of the people felt as though we were
                    excluding them. Manila has over 700 people, families of an extraordinary
                    variety.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DALY: Spread out and to make those attempts meant that there was no way you could
                    include everybody, no way you could do everything. So, on the one hand you'd be
                    getting people saying, “Oh, that's nice” and others saying, “Why don't you do
                    this.” Suzanne did this, why don't you do this.</p>

                    up, which was four coups. We had the killing of the three Air Force men up in
                    Clark and the next year the killing of Nick Rowe of JUSMAG. That was terribly
                    close because by this time we were — you had set the framework to get the CLO
                    assistant and she was in place and her husband worked directly for Nick Rowe and
                    her husband, Kathy Keater's husband, was the one to get to Nick Rowe's side and
                    try and save and try and keep him alive and of course he could not. He himself
                    was under threat so we were dealing with this on a very direct level. Sheila

                    done many seminars for us before this on different topics including the crisis
                    management so the awareness level in the community was quite high. With the,
                    remember you had started the dependent security briefings and we continued them
                    and she had done the crisis management with you and then we had her do it again
                    and we also did a mid-life crisis one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Oh boy! Did we need that one and several others and the Ambassador
                    continued to come to every dependent security briefing. We had started the
                    children and teens security briefings. So the awareness was much higher. The
                    neighborhood networks that you had started were continued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They functioned well then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DALY: They don't function well, no. They are a marvelous idea and they serve a
                    purpose and do continue, but they can only function as you have a continued
                    effort by dedicated volunteers and that we were running out of. Also, because of
                    the increased awareness, people were beginning to feel they didn't need this and
                    they didn't need that because they knew this and they knew that. Every time
                    people would begin to feel perhaps the slightest bit complacent something would
                    happen in Manila that would make you realize that your security was never going
                    to be there completely. So Sheila stuck right in and we did all kinds of
                    critical incident debriefings for the families, for the children involved, in
                    all of this. It kept the atmosphere calm through it all, at least we hope it
                    did.Because I missed the earthquake, thank God! I think in terms of getting the
                    community more together it was important because when we had the first major
                    coup attempt — in AID there is a number, because our professionals are out in
                    the countryside working for extended periods of time and many of them take
                    double and triple tours and they are also at the marrying age, they get married
                    overseas. I think AID has a higher proportion of foreign-born wives than does
                    the State Department, although the State Department is catching up. In Manila at
                    that time we had about 8 Vietnamese wives in AID, who clustered together anyway
                    because they were comfortable within their own group, however we had begun to
                    get them reaching out and we had to work very hard to continue that because as
                    soon as that first coup attempt hit they really pulled back because to them it
                    was Viet Nam all over again. We had to work with them to realize they were not
                    afraid, there was some feeling that oh they're afraid, no that wasn't it they
                    must ... (end of Tape 1, side A)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anne, we were just talking about the Vietnamese wives in
                        Manila and I wanted to repeat, I think the last sentence was that they were
                        not really afraid although that there must have been some sentiment that
                        they must have been afraid. Do you want to continue from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>DALY: Okay. It wasn't fear it was their sense of precaution. They just felt that
                    it was time to stay around the house, perhaps start going through their things,
                    start planning on what would go, and what they would take. I think they did that
                    and then we were able to get them to rejoin the community. One of the ways that
                    worked very well was we had several of them giving cooking lessons, either in
                    group sessions or private and one of them even we brought into the club to try
                    and get some effect on the chef in terms of some dishes to introduce on the menu
                    at the club having been trained by a real Vietnamese cook. It worked for a while
                    then she left the country when we needed to be retrained. We had made efforts in
                    that regard to try and get the spread out for the community to try and get them
                    to join in different things. We also used — I went to AID to get some help on
                    certain things making them a part — Suzanne you had already gotten an AID
                    vehicle to be used to take people out to one of the charity projects. We
                    continued that. With the new admin officer, we had to write a letter and a memo
                    reconfirming it and going through the whole process and then we further got them
                    to help us with the vans because we got an AID wife to do city orientation tours
                    for newcomers. She's coming back this summer and had to train some replacements
                    before she left. She did two tours on alternate Fridays and had some help from
                    other people, but basically it was this one person, Kay Olsen. She did a
                    marvelous job. She took small groups of people, sometimes only two and never
                    more than five from all different agencies and they were in a van together for
                    no more than 2 � to 3 hours and kidding around and going around the city and
                    learning their way around and realizing that people from different agencies
                    could talk to one another and could even become friendly and under Kay's
                    tutelage you had to. We got AID and the embassy to switch off on the vans on
                    that. So that we brought AID into helping us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there's a sense of cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>DALY: Yes and that worked and as far as I know it's still working. It better be
                    because they need all the help they can get out there. I think the CLO job out
                    there is the most demanding work I've ever done. I'm sure it was the same for
                    you. My husband laughed at me because I used to tell him all the time, “Oh you
                    don't have to work overtime. The government will continue to function if you
                    stay home,” and he would occasionally look at me and laugh as I was going in on
                    a Saturday morning to finish up some paperwork that couldn't get done during the
                    week with people coming in. But it was worth it. It was wonderfully worth it. I
                    think that I enjoyed the ombudsman role, what I call the ombudsman role of the
                    job. Many of the people who worked in the embassy as part of the admin staff did
                    not enjoy the regular Tuesday admin meetings. They felt it took time away from
                    their more important work. I loved them because it was my way of tuning in with
                    them, of gaining information that I had no other access to — that being one of
                    the difficulties perhaps of not being a State Department spouse. I did not know
                    all of the people in there, I didn't understand all of the job functions and the
                    interrelations between the people and what was happening, so those meetings for
                    me were like taking a post graduate course and I thoroughly profited from them
                    in learning how to deal with the different people, avoid confrontations, and
                    learn to get things done by being prepared, by being able to bring a proposal to
                    the admin officer in such a way he was able to say yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You became a more functioning part of the admin team
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Absolutely, absolutely and he definitely relies on the CLO to provide him
                    with a sense of what's happening in the community with a true picture of
                    complaints, of worries, of where people are nervous, and he also wants ideas. He
                    wants you to come to him, not just with their complaints, he wants solutions
                    from you, potential solutions, or possible ways to deal with it and he listens.
                    I appreciated that. He did not want a yes person. He wanted to know what was
                    going on. I know again, in terms of the working relationship, there were people
                    in the community who felt that I didn't stand up and tell him what for on some
                    things and I felt that would have been the kiss of death to have presented him
                    with anything in that way he could very easily say no. And since the CLO
                    operates without a budget of its own, the good will of the Admin Officer and his
                    entire staff is extremely necessary for the functioning of the CLO. We found
                    that if we were prepared, if we were able to present him with our request, our
                    needs, or whatever in a way that gave him a way to say yes we got what we wanted
                    — most of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very important. I think being a CLO is working hand
                        in hand with the powers that be. You take a lot of flack off of the Admin

                <p>DALY: Yes. You're an information resource and you're also a different way of
                    looking at a problem. You're also out there with the community that they really
                    don't have a lot of time to spend with and so you are the one that's bringing to
                    them the sense of the community and you better be right.</p>

                <p>DALY: We have been married 27 years and of those years we have spent almost 16 of
                    them overseas in an assortment of posts. Very much, I was a teacher before we
                    were married and I continued teaching after we were married. I was in New York
                    at the time when you had to quit when you were six months pregnant. The second
                    child I stayed home with the children or had to, then we went to Cuba. I worked
                    as a sub. I have been able to work as a substitute teacher almost every place we
                    have gone, but could not get a regular teaching position when I was ready for it
                    or wanted it or could have used it because the early years in the Navy the
                    children were going to DoD schools. DoD hires its teachers usually from the
                    States through a very prolonged Federal hiring process. If you are at the post
                    long enough you can get hired. In Panama at the time we were there the first
                    time the schools were Panama Canal Zone schools not Department of Defense. Had
                    we been there longer I probably could have gotten a job. They hired their long
                    term Zone residents. If I was going to be there for ten years I would definitely
                    [have] been able to get a job, but as what was consider a transient military I
                    could get a job as a substitute, which I did do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that at lower pay than if you had been hired in the
                        United State under the Federal hiring program or do they pay you at the same
                        rate as someone they hired in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: In the Canal Zone there was only one pay rate. In other places, the DoD
                    schools have only one pay rate. When I worked as a substitute in Pakistan I was
                    on a local pay rate. When I worked full time at the Brent School in Manila I was
                    on local hire plus. So I made $5,000 teaching at the Brent School. I made $5,000
                    when I started teaching in New York City 26 years ago. So I've not come a long
                    way. These things cost. I'm typical of the wives at that time, I think, or in
                    some sense as well in terms of try to grab what you can where you are and make
                    use of it and getting caught. Now to turn up at anything you basically need to
                    have a Master's Degree. I have 55 credits toward a Masters Degree but no degree
                    and I won't get it. I would have to start all over again because mine hasn't
                    assigned. I've gotten those credits in New York, Panama, Japan, back in Panama.
                    I stayed in a BOQ for a week to get a course and it all adds up to being able to
                    list the course but still no degree. When it comes to getting a job, we are very
                    definitely those who have been caught. We too could have used a second salary;
                    we still could very much because the timing hasn't been very good. So, for the
                    younger women coming in who won't put up with that, who look upon having a job
                    as a necessity, for those who are willing to take a job and not a career path
                    they may continue to go overseas and with continued pushing make more job
                    openings possible to continue with an interrupted professional or
                    nonprofessional or semi-professional job path of some kind. It's not satisfying.
                    It can be immediately satisfying, but that constant interruption and going
                    nowhere with it. Having to stay on an entry level. Right now if I am competing
                    for jobs in the private sector, I am basically in competition with my own
                    daughter. That's not a comforting feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you've worked all of your life.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>DALY: When you've worked all of your life. So for the younger women who are
                    trying to find their way through, they really are not going to put up with that
                    too much longer. At least they are not going to do it and have a happy home.
                    It's creating severe tensions. The jobs that — there are openings to some good
                    jobs now overseas. The bi-lateral agreement that FLO has pushed has been put
                    into act in many countries serves some purpose. In most places that works best
                    for somebody who is in some kind of an entrepreneurial field: the artists, the
                    musicians, the photographers, the writers, the editors, even now some of the
                    computer specialists can do something in a lot of local markets, but the normal
                    career path personnel type — even the engineer, the doctor, the lawyer — cannot
                    be licensed in most other countries. You can't work. It's still difficult to
                    work in professional fields in most countries that you go to because they are
                    protecting their own people. For tandem couples it's a wonderful concept, but
                    there's not going to be any way — it's going to be more difficult to fit those
                    people in. Either as both go up the career ladder and therefore are looking at
                    posts with fewer choices or as one goes up and the other one stays at a slightly
                    lower level. Maybe taking time out to have a child in between, losing a
                    promotion step along the way. If they continue to draw down on certain posts,
                    again the choices are becoming fewer. The fields that are growing may not be the
                    ones that are going to allow this choice. It's going to mean separated families
                    or unhappiness on the singles who feel they're being discriminated against to
                    make room for a tandem couple. Where they have separate allowances, again you
                    have the built in resentments that you may understand it intellectually, but
                    emotionally it is not appreciated. The role of the volunteer, where a great deal
                    of our image overseas has created a lot of the good feelings that remains in
                    places, particularly in the Philippines. When you were there, when I was there,
                    a lot of the areas where good feeling remains toward Americans is because of the
                    American volunteer efforts. One area, this charity project that the wives club
                    is still continued in terms of a squatters area community. Many people in the
                    community have been part of the NPA the local communist gorilla movement and yet
                    the general feeling in that community is one of absolute welcome to the American
                    women who come out in a government van because we have done over a period of 15
                    to 20 years now such solid real good work out there, enabling those people many
                    of them to hold jobs. It has been a very productive, a very positive project.
                    We're running out of volunteers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're all working.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>DALY: They're all working. We're running out of CLO applicants, because they're
                    working at other jobs. AID has a very definite push, most of it is agency policy
                    and of course it works better in some places than in others, but it is agency
                    policy to try and hire spouses, make jobs for spouses. Manila hires about, 4, 8
                    — 12 spouses are hired in AID mission Manila. That's a high number. They are not
                    all AID spouses, a couple of them are State Department and assorted others. A
                    couple of those jobs are very professional level jobs. They are not secretaries.
                    They are not pouch room or mail room. They're project officers, computer
                    specialists, Deputy Admin Officer, the GSO Officer. They're done on a contract
                    so the salary's pretty good but there's no benefits, there's no career level. So
                    you still finish, you've got a resume if somebody can read it. The tandem
                    couples, the pressure, and many of them have not faced it, at our orientation
                    meetings and in the security briefings we really push the information to the
                    tandem couples with children. The security level again in Manila is not much to
                    be comforted by. We had to push them to make sure they had thought through the
                    process, the steps, in terms of what was going to happen with the children in
                    case of an evacuation and one or both of the spouses had to remain at post. Did
                    they have this all worked out and many of them don't because it's something you
                    don't want to think about so you push it off until tomorrow. A big part with the
                    tandem couples is to push them to deal with their family issues because they're
                    concentrating so hard on the career to show that they can do their professional
                    job that frequently they are neglecting the paperwork for their families. It is
                    very very difficult, the pressure on the tandem couples that I saw out there was
                    very intense.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to throw you a slight curve ball, what did you think
                        about when you had dependent spouses come out that were male?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Oh boy!</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>DALY: We had five of them, maybe six.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work out? Did they want to be part of the
                        community? Did they want to do volunteer work? Were they pretty much apart
                        and on their own or did they want a job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: All of the above.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of the above, okay let's hear because if they want a
                        job, did you feel there was more of a scramble to get them a job over</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DALY: In one instance, yes. Our male spouses were as variable as our women. It
                    was really funny, partially funny to see the differences that we had. We had in
                    one case, which was really lovely, the retired husband with the now career wife.
                    That's wonderful. They're enjoying that thoroughly. Do volunteer work. Come in,
                    you need help on something, absolutely marvelous. We had the very young male
                    spouse who wanted to go to college, had not completed college and while there
                    are graduate-level opportunities in Manila going to the local colleges — not
                    undergraduate. The undergraduate road is very very difficult and so this young
                    man was commuting to Clark Air Base. That's a minimum of an hour and forty-five
                    minute commute one way. He was doing it in an elderly Volkswagen without air
                    conditioning. He was not enjoying it, but meanwhile he also, they were newlyweds
                    at this time and had decided they would do this. I don't know how it's going to
                    work out in the long run. She is of course in the consular section working very
                    very hard. She's very good; he's very bright, very charming. There are no jobs
                    for him so he is trying to take some courses and in the meantime he plays
                    basketball and he's coaching one of the FSM basketball teams. He has worked with
                    us on projects. We have called on him to help on some of the charity things and
                    he comes and he does and his wife has come as a volunteer with him on some
                    Halloween party things and he has helped with some of the kids in summer camp.
                    Not on a regular basis but yes we've gotten him involved in that way and he's
                    happy to do it. We've had only really one bad case and that person would be
                    unhappy here, there, or anywhere. It's exaggerated by being overseas, which he
                    had never been before. It's exaggerated by his wife being a fairly low level
                    salary. So they weren't paying rent. They were only able to do it because
                    housing was provided. He was trying very dutifully to be the house husband and
                    very good father to his children, but he was just not a happy person and created
                    problems because he was there all the time and he would not help with volunteer
                    work. Finally two of the women prevailed upon him to help one time each on a
                    project, but that was all he would do. He was a complainer and whatever his
                    personal problems were, they were exaggerated by being there and did cause a
                    degree of ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not necessarily a male related thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: It was neither male related nor Manila related. He was the aberrant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Spouses, whether they were male or female all carried
                        their own personal ...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>DALY: Yeah, we had one young man who was a lawyer and he was very happy. He was
                    running tennis clinics, teaching at the local law school part time, he worked on
                    a couple of temporary projects. He very much wanted a full time job and he did
                    eventually get one. There was some feeling, well we ought to get him a job until
                    I mentioned why should he be given more consideration than the female spouses
                    who are applying. There was a little pulling back from that, but because he was
                    such a popular person. He was in the poker circle and he was in the tennis
                    circle. The men on the employment hiring committee did kind of want to give him
                    a job, but we all did. But I didn't want him treated differently from the female
                    spouses who were applying and in truth he was not. There started to be some
                    consideration on that and then they said, “no I guess not, no, no he qualified
                    for this one fine.” It did work out. That can be a growing problem. It's going
                    to be a problem for the Department in a way that a lot of these couples coming
                    out are saying let's try this for a tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More as an experiment, not as a career.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Yes. We're getting many more of the younger couples coming in even without
                    the female spouse not working coming out for a nonworking tour, but may have had
                    other careers before. They're coming into the State Department perhaps a little
                    bit later than they were. They know they've got options. These are people that
                    were doing quite well in whatever they were doing before, but they always wanted
                    to try the State Department. They passed that exam, they got through it and
                    they're going to give it a try. Maybe it's not what they expected. The housing
                    for some of them I know, the apartments in Manila just were not what they had in
                    mind because to tell the apartments on the Manila compound that I'm talking
                    about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seafront.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Yes. Much of the housing in Manila is wonderful, but the apartments on the
                    seafront compound are awful. Whoever designed them and engineered them should be
                    forced to live in them to see how dreadful they are, but meanwhile young couples
                    are going into them. They don't like them. The pressure on the job is very heavy
                    out there and there's no one out there who's underworked and they know they've
                    got other alternatives. So they're saying let's give the State Department a
                    chance. Let's see how it is. It gives us a couple of years free out of country
                    and if we don't like it we'll leave. The more dissatisfaction in the career path
                    and lack of employment for the spouse or the pressures of the tandem. The
                    Department is going to be losing an awful lot of these young couples. Now they
                    may be happy to loose them. Some of them would not fit anyway, but you don't
                    have people coming in with the idea that they're going to do a career with the
                    Department as they used to.</p>

                    a little bit, but I see in the younger people coming in that they're trying it
                    out. If we like it we'll stay. If we don't like it; we'll get out.</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>DALY: It's primarily I'll make the difference between AID and State because
                    that's the one I know. I found again out in Manila particularly because I was
                    dealing with the others. We had three levels of difference. Going back what was
                    it five years ago that the FLO sponsored that survey that went out to everybody
                    that resulted in that blue book, the findings on the foreign service spouse. It
                    was an excellent survey, but even in the report I felt from my angle of
                    difference that not enough attention was paid to what I consider to be the other
                    foreign service. That most of the attention appeared to be on the traditional
                    diplomatic representational foreign service and did not take into consideration
                    many of the concerns of the rest of us. We're not on the diplomatic list, we're
                    not on the diplomatic circuit, we are other agencies of other forms and that
                    there are levels within the service and how those can be ameliorated or
                    exacerbated depends upon the people at post because the different agencies serve
                    different institutional purposes and therefore do have different climates and
                    there shouldn't be a change in that, otherwise they wouldn't be functioning
                    properly. Since each also functions under different sets of regulations, even
                    though we're all under the standard FMPs there still are differences within the
                    agencies and the more those are played up, the unhappier your post. If there are
                    differences with R&amp;R. Now, there can't be with most of the agencies, but the
                    VA exists overseas only in Manila. They don't know what they're doing. They
                    signed on with the Foreign Service Association and all those things except that
                    somebody in Washington didn't catch on and so they were denied their R&amp;R. I
                    think they're getting it back. The embassy is fighting it through to them that
                    this is not proper, but meanwhile you had a group of very unhappy people. Now if
                    you have a small group of very unhappy people they can spread that unhappiness
                    very quickly. It can feed on the community. In the communications if AID people
                    for instance, we can't have pools, we can't have houses with pools. That goes
                    back to Jack Anderson report some 10, 12 years ago. In a policy way it makes
                    very good sense. The AID people are supposed to be working with the less
                    affluent members of community generally, you're not supposed to live that much
                    better than they do, however, in truth that can cause absolute ridiculous
                    circumstances where in many countries the only housing where you can put western
                    families into say have pools and the alternative is the shack down the road.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>DALY: Manila has a little bit more opportunity than that, but can still put
                    itself into silly situations where it can't lease a house that would be cheaper
                    than the one they do lease because the cheaper house has a pool. They can't rent
                    it or they can't lease it. If it's handled in a humorous fashion kidding each
                    other, going to visit a friend who's a State Department and has a big pool in
                    the backyard and you can kid about it it's fine, but if you have somebody
                    sitting back in that AID mission say humph, we can't have one why should they,
                    and that spreads you have to be able to diffuse that attitude. The military
                    people get really upset because they generally have to go out and find their own
                    housing. They don't have a GSO of any real substance for the embassy. They have
                    a smaller allowance, so they have to go out and feel they have to take the
                    leavings. The houses that the State Department doesn't take, the AID leases, the
                    houses that AID won't lease then the military can get. This creates bad feelings
                    and there should be a way that, back here in Washington, that there should be a
                    smoothing of those edges because if you've got unhappy families then the
                    employees it's going to spill over into the workplace. The attempt should be to
                    have cooperation among the agencies. They are theoretically all working for the
                    same government although sometimes that seems to get lost in some of the
                    disputes. The attitudes are going to remain different and there are some changes
                    that can be made in regulations. Mostly it's making the people who are in a
                    position to change attitudes at a post of the need to do so and frequently the
                    State Department people are perceived as being insensitive to the attitudes and
                    needs and existence even of some of the other agencies. Everybody gets locked
                    into their own little world and their own way of doing things.</p>

                    attitudes can. We've seen it change. We've seen it go from bad to good to good
                    to bad. It only takes a few, but it must take that awareness and it has to come
                    from the top. We are living in a hierarchical organization and people, you can
                    do things on a small level, but to have a post attitude of working together.
                    It's fine to have a CLO working like crazy to do all of this and it's fine to
                    get your volunteer doing it, but it must come from the attitude of the senior
                    officers at post. They must be seen to want this.</p>

                <p>DALY: And support it. By their presence, by their words, by deeds, such as
                    letters thanking volunteers or plaques or even a recognition day for volunteer
                    service and recognition that they are hearing what the community is saying. A

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does AID do a charm school for their mission directors?
                        That's what we like to call our ambassador's course. The DCMs and
                        ambassadors in the State Department do take charm school courses where they
                        learn what it is like to be an ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: I don't know. I don't think so. I really don't know whether they go down to
                    the DCM and ambassador's training or whether the mission directors go with them,
                    they would if they get it because a Mission Director in Manila is usually as
                    senior as you get, as senior as the ambassador usually and he's also, generally
                    speaking, the third ranking member of the mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you mentioned when you need that kind of attitude from
                        the top often it would be helpful to get sort of sensitization to it at the
                        program level.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>DALY: It helps to have them working together, the ambassador and the mission
                    director. In Manila, that had been very successful. The two mission directors
                    that were there during my time in Manila both had a very good professional and a
                    personal relationship with the two ambassadors that were also there during that
                    period. I also know of missions where that is not the case. If the mission
                    director is not reasonably close or has a good relationship with the ambassador
                    then those missions are going to be very separate. There are some mission
                    directors that want it that way for whatever their reasons, who knows, but then
                    you've got pretty unhappy posts or you've got people who just live in such small
                    circles. That's fine for some people, that's what they want. Some people have to
                    have that. They can't spread out. They have to create a small universe for
                    themselves to live. Fine, but not for a whole group. I know of one case where an
                    ambassador's wife had said that she thought it was silly to have an embassy
                    wives club and an American wives club and she wanted all of the mission women to
                    join the American women's club and the embassy women's club ceased to exist. The
                    AID women took umbrage at that. This is post blue sheet 1973, 74; this was early
                    80s I think and so they took a vote and decided that none of them would join the
                    American women's club and that they would stay with the embassy women's club
                    because they would not be told what to do and both clubs continued to exist. At
                    the same time it was silly because it also deprived some of these women of the
                    opportunity to join both. I think there is room for the two of them to exist;
                    it's a big enough community, but to make choices of either is the wrong way to
                    go. Our aim was to broaden everybody's opportunity to do things because people
                    discovered things about themselves. They did things that they never thought they
                    could do and that's wonderful. And to try and get some of the people who were
                    saying there's nothing ... Some of the women who must work and there is no job.
                    So to try and find something meaningful that they can do so at least they know
                    that it's a stop gap, it's volunteer but they get credit for the volunteer
                    service and they can try to do something that they would be embarrassed to do
                    back home. They can take the chance and fail in a comforting community kind of
                    thing. So many people did try and do things that they never thought they could
                    do before. It's very hard to get them to do this and with the security issues
                    when people are cut back and told they can't go out and they've got to pull in
                    then to get them to do something that is positive and not turn everybody sour.
                    The CLO's job out there is very stressful and Sheila Platt's job, as the wife
                    of, is very stressful. She is worried about him and the work she does in the
                    community. I don't know how she's taking it, but she's very remarkable. The
                    foreign service experience is not an unblemished one. It's not easy. For us,
                    however, I still feel the rewards have far outweighed the things that we've gone
                    through and which happened kind of varied and we've had our costs very
                    definitely. But I've also lived in Japan; I've also lived in Pakistan; I've also
                    lived in Latin America; I've lived in the Philippines. I would not have had that
                    opportunity and I would not give it up for anything. We do run into problems
                    with the AID wives tend again with the men marrying the women of the area that
                    they're in. In Latin America there is a very heavy concentration of Latin wives
                    and they tend to look askance at the anglo wives who come and do not speak
                    Spanish in some areas. They say well you should speak Spanish and I say well I
                    speak a little but I have not spent my life in Latin America. On that basis I
                    would have to know Spanish, Urdu, Japanese, Tagalog and I am not that good a
                    linguist and very few people are. That's hard. It would be nice if we could
                    learn one or two, but the way his job goes we've been going to so many different
                    language areas. That's part that we have missed.</p>

                <p>DALY: Oh, it's extended. They can not give that to State without giving that to
                    AID, but opportunity all those wonderful benefits like OBC too. Presume that you
                    are spending time in Washington. We are getting more people coming into all of
                    the agencies from other parts of the country at later periods of their life who
                    are going directly overseas from wherever they've been hired in these specialty
                    categories or AID contract hires who come through Washington, who get no
                    preparation for going overseas, no briefing, no information. Some of them think
                    to go to their local library or many of them maybe buy a Fodor's travel
                    catalogue and that's all they have when they arrive. They don't know that there
                    are people and places at whatever post they go to that they can go to for
                    information, guidance, help. So we have more people arriving overseas that are
                    less prepared for it than I believe they were before. This includes even the
                    State Department people now coming in through the specialty lines, AID through
                    the contract agencies, the military of course. The military is doing a better
                    job than it used to in preparing its people, but it is still doing a rather poor
                    job. They prepare their officers, but they are still very weak on preparing
                    families. They still don't want to hear any complaints from them when they get
                    wherever they're going. Even with the difficulties we were going through when
                    Nick Rowe was killed and after that. We had reached out because again I had
                    Kathy Keater working in the office and so we made a very particular effort to
                    bring in the military spouses and Sheila Platt again really reach out to them.
                    That has made a big change because particularly the JUSMAG people felt very much
                    apart, they lived further away from the embassy. They could not comprehend how
                    they were supposed to be somewhat attached to the embassy. There was resentment
                    and it took a great deal of steady, concentrated, multi-avenued effort to
                    attempt to bring them in and make that change, which the embassy had to have
                    because otherwise you had this canker working there. The military didn't help
                    that much. They've got all kinds of resources on the base, but the military that
                    live in Manila cannot benefit from those support systems because you can't
                    travel 3 hours a day to get them. We had young enlisted people in Manila and
                    that's another big post if they've got the young enlisted military. It's awful.
                    It shouldn't be. The APO post office, if you have single young airmen there,
                    they got into trouble in the city because Manila offers young men all kinds of
                    ways to get into trouble, but at least they could afford to live there after a
                    fashion. We had some of those young men married, bringing those young, very
                    young brides from the States with no preparation and no support systems and
                    their salary could not afford to live in a decent place. They were miserable and
                    some of these young men had joined the Air Force in the hopes of being able to
                    take advantage of the educational benefits through the military. Clark Air Base
                    has 4 or 5 different college programs, none of which these people could take
                    advantage of because they couldn't make the commute. So they would be doubly
                    hurt in terms of feeling hurt by this and were being hurt by losing the
                    opportunity to use those advantages that were supposed to be theirs and which
                    they couldn't use. That makes for a very unhappy part of the community. We tried
                    to bring a couple of them in to work with the Teen Center. Pull them in for the
                    Halloween by specifically calling them. These are serious problems that the
                    overseas communities are going to face increasingly. People are not willing to
                    put up with being very unhappy over a protracted period of time. If the spouses
                    are at home unhappy the employment is going to suffer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DALY: Oh. That's very hard. I'd say as a family post Pakistan was, Karachi until
                    we got evacuated. For cultural interest probably Japan. That was an absolutely
                    fascinating society and we perhaps by living out as we did got a little bit more
                    of a glimpse into it than some other people did. For employment opportunities
                    for myself for me personally it would have also been Karachi. The school board
                    experience was absolutely marvelous and then Manila the CLO job was absolutely
                    the most intense, exciting, exasperating, frustrating, stretching experience
                    I've ever had. Panama was fun. Panama was just a nice extended period. Our worst
                    post was probably Guantanamo, Cuba the first one out. Whether because it was the
                    first or the situation there it's over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think you'll be going out again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DALY: Don't know. We never say never. My husband is approaching within a few
                    years the retirement level, but who knows there is always the possibility. Would
                    we go again — yes. We might object to a post because we've never had a choice.
                    That's again a difference. AID people do have some choice generally, regular
                    people, but the IG doesn't. We've only got a few places to go. So, we've been to
                    all but Cairo; oh, we haven't been to Africa. We've never had a post in Africa
                    and we have not been to Cairo.</p>
