                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 5, 1988. I am Arthur Tienken, on behalf of
                        the Foreign Service History Center of George Washington University, and I
                        shall be interviewing Ambassador William B. Edmondson principally on his
                        experiences in the early days of our embassy in Zambia in 1965 and a little
                        later than that. If time permits, I shall ask Bill if he might want to
                        comment a little bit on his earlier experiences in both Tanganyika and
                        Ghana.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Ambassador, may I first ask you something about what motivated you originally
                    to become interested in the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, my first academic interest was in law, and I had assumed during
                    High School that I would probably have to take an undergraduate degree in
                    education and then do some teaching to earn the money to get to law school.
                    World War II intervened, however, and I spent about four years in the Army,
                    including two years as an officer in the occupation forces in Germany. While
                    serving in the occupation, I did a lot of reading about international affairs;
                    and I can still remember spending a lot of time on a USAFE textbook by Sharp and
                    Kirk, entitled Contemporary International Politics. Increasingly, my original
                    interest in law turned toward an interest in international law, international
                    affairs, and foreign relations. I was impressed, I think, by the causes and
                    effects of World War II, by the bombed-out cities and buildings, and the hungry
                    kids with spindly legs. As an idealistic young man, I wanted to do something to
                    help prevent things like that occurring again. It was this that made me think of
                    studying for a career in international affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I received some college training during my first months in the army as a member
                    of the ASTRP—the Army Specialized Training Reserve Program—doing pre-engineering
                    studies at the University of Wyoming. When I got out of the army, I returned to
                    Nebraska to go to college on the GI Bill. First, I attended a short summer
                    school session at Peru State Teachers College, then entered the University of
                    Nebraska in the Fall of 1948. I still considered going into law school, perhaps
                    with a concentration on international law, but for a variety of reasons, I
                    became more interested in the political science side of international law and
                    enrolled in a newly organized “international affairs group major.”</p>
                <p>My original intention was not particularly to go into the Foreign Service, but to
                    get into some kind of international work such as with the United Nations. Much
                    of my early academic work was in international organization affairs. I got an
                    A.B. with High Distinction from the University of Nebraska in 1950, then did a
                    year of graduate work at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and got my
                    M.A. degree in 1951. During that same year I took and passed both the Foreign
                    Service exams and the “Junior Management Assistant/Junior Social Science
                    Assistant” Civil Service exams.</p>
                <p>In June, 1951 I began work as a Department of State Intern on a one year program
                    of rotational assignments. I began in the Bureau of UN Affairs, then worked for
                    the UN Affairs Adviser in the Far Eastern Bureau, and finished the year in the
                    Trusteeship Division of the Office of Dependent Area Affairs.</p>
                <p>During this period, I learned that I had passed the oral exams for the Foreign
                    Service, so I had to decide whether to go ahead with the kind of civil service
                    work I was doing or whether I should enter the Foreign Service. An important
                    element in the decision was the fact that I had been married in 1951, so I
                    consulted with my wife, and we decided to give the Foreign Service a try. That
                    led to a long career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, after entering the Foreign Service, it
                        wasn't too long before you became what I might call rather deeply interested
                        in Africa. Was there some special motivation for this or did it just happen
                        to be a Foreign Service career pattern that started out by your being
                        assigned to Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, I think it was largely an accident. My original regional
                    interest, if I had any, was perhaps in Southeast Asia. I had taken a
                    multi-disciplinary seminar on Southeast Asia at the University of Nebraska, and
                    continued to follow that interest along with my specialization in International
                    Organization Affairs and International Law at the Fletcher School. As things
                    happened, these interests were quite relevant to my rotational assignments as an
                    intern. Before the end of my assignment as an intern, I was promoted into a
                    regular Civil Service position in the Office of Dependent Area Affairs and
                    stayed there until I entered the Foreign Service in September, 1952. During that
                    time I worked on UN trusteeship affairs, served a couple weeks as an adviser on
                    the US delegation to the Trusteeship Council in New York, and dealt with a
                    number of problems involving some of the African trust territories.</p>
                <p>As a result, my last civil service supervisor (Vernon McKay, who later left the
                    Service and had a distinguished academic career teaching African affairs),
                    unbeknownst to me, recommended when I entered the Foreign Service and began my
                    Foreign Service training, that I be assigned to a post in Africa because he
                    thought I would be a good candidate. So, when the list of posts came out, I
                    found that I had been assigned to Dar-es-Salaam. And, although most of my
                    classmates expressed sympathy to me on getting such an assignment, I was really
                    very delighted, because I had done enough work on the area to know that it was
                    interesting, and I thought going to a trust territory would be especially
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>That started the long career. There's a longer story to it than that, but—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well, let me take you now to Zambia. You
                        arrived in Zambia in—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: 1965. It was in April, 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: April 1965, in the capacity of Deputy Chief of Mission. Is
                        that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: That's correct, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what did the staff consist
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: There was the Ambassador, myself as DCM replacing Bob Foulon (who had
                    been DCM only a short time, as he was Principal Officer of the consulate that
                    preceded the Embassy and then served as the first Charg� d'Affaires ad interim
                    until the Ambassador arrived), an economic officer (Larry Williamson, who had
                    been number two in the former consulate), a political officer (Eugene Jeffers),
                    a political-consular officer (Temple Cole, who gave special attention to the
                    political refugees from Southern Rhodesia and South Africa), and two
                    administrative officers in what was called the Combined Administrative
                    Management Office, or CAMO. There was an ambassadorial secretary, a DCM
                    secretary who also helped the Economic Officer, and one communicator. I'm not
                    sure that we had any other non-AID American staff at that time, although we
                    later added another communicator whom we shared with the AID mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That staff must have been built up fairly rapidly given
                        the fact that until independence Lusaka served as a kind of outpost of the
                        Consul General in Salisbury. Is that a fair statement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, generally speaking, that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that in the months before you arrived, all these other
                        people were in the process of arriving as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes. In addition, of course, there were AID officers and I don't
                    recall when they had come, but there were already at least several AID officers
                    on board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had AID officers, that is, staff from the Agency
                        for International Development, and USIA, the information service. Were there
                        other agencies as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No, that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. The Ambassador was Robert Good, if I remember right,
                        and he was a non-career ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: That's correct. He was a non-career ambassador, but he had served for
                    at least two or three, perhaps nearly four, years as the Director of the Office
                    of Research and Analysis for Africa in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
                    (INR). With experience as an academic in political science and as a research
                    specialist, as well as in managing an office of the Department of State, he was
                    quite familiar with the reporting processes of the service; he was certainly not
                    a complete outsider.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He probably expected you, as his Deputy, to fill a
                        particular role in the embassy. Can you tell me a little bit about what he
                        expected of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, he did want me to act as an alter ego for him, which made the
                    job far more interesting. He made it clear to everyone that on many matters they
                    were to come first to me and that in such cases my decision would be his
                    decision. Obviously we consulted very, very closely. But he gave me full
                    discretion on signing off on some of the economic and political cables. I used
                    my own judgment as to those which I knew he would want to see. We kept a reading
                    file and, because he was extremely active and interested in substantive matters,
                    himself, I showed quite a large proportion of cables to him. It was only the
                    reporting cables that didn't have extensive interpretation or that sort of thing
                    that I signed off myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it from what you just said that relations between
                        you and the Ambassador were very favorable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Excellent, in fact. I was extremely fortunate. I was his choice as a
                    Deputy Chief of Mission probably because of reporting that I had done in Ghana.
                    When I returned from Ghana in 1964, he was still the Director of INR's Africa
                    Office—known as INR/RAF then—and had just called a conference at Airlie House of
                    his analysts plus a few selected outsiders, either Foreign Service people or
                    academics. As a former INR analyst, I was one of the FSO's invited to
                    participate. He said then that another reason I was invited was that he had
                    liked the reporting I had done from Ghana. So I think that may also have been an
                    influential factor in his choosing me as a Deputy Chief of Mission (to my
                    surprise) some months later. I had been back in the Department for less than a
                    year when I went to Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the quality of the rest of the staff, and
                        did they work together well as a team?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: By and large, I think the quality was very good and the cooperation
                    was good. We had difficulties with the CAMO, the Combined Administrative
                    Management Office, simply because of the nature of an organization having to
                    serve both the embassy—the new embassy—and the AID staff. Of course, the AID
                    director wanted certain things from the organization, as did the embassy, and
                    there were difficulties from time to time. There were extremely difficult
                    administrative problems that CAMO had to deal with, and it had a very small
                    staff. It had a CAMO director and a deputy.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The first CAMO director was an AID officer who had served as an AID executive
                    officer—in Addis Ababa, I believe it was—and was used to running a much larger
                    organization. The deputy was an officer who I think had been a General Services
                    Officer with some limited consular experience at another post. Anyway, both
                    officers found it difficult to cope with an organization that had more demands
                    than it had facilities to meet those demands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what was your understanding of
                        what the Department of State in Washington expected the Ambassador and by
                        derivation you to consider to be your principal mission, or his principal
                        mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, in those days, the instructions to ambassadors, to new
                    ambassadors, were far less explicit than they are today. And we didn't have a
                    Mission Statement or country-specific set of instructions to follow. But clearly
                    one of the priority concerns that we had was to help prepare for the possibility
                    of a unilateral declaration of independence in Southern Rhodesia, UDI, as it was
                    called. Before I left for Zambia I was invited to participate in a number of
                    meetings that were being held in the Eastern and Southern African Division of
                    the Africa Bureau (AF) on the matter of preparations to help Zambia in the case
                    of sanctions being applied against Southern Rhodesia. This was still a very
                    academic problem at that time, but already there was a UN official, an economist
                    named Gordon Goundry, who had been assigned to help Zambia lead its own
                    preparations. Goundry had come to Washington to hold meetings with various
                    officials in the Department of State and other agencies to consider what
                    conceivably could be done. It was, as I said, very much still an academic
                    exercise, but it was a very good introduction for me to the kinds of problems
                    that we would be much occupied with when I arrived in Zambia. So I would give
                    that the highest priority.</p>
                <p>The embassy had already explored ideas as to how we could keep or strengthen the
                    western connection of Zambia and other countries in a similar situation if
                    indeed the Ian Smith government in Southern Rhodesia did decide illegally to
                    declare independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come back in a bit to talk about your experiences
                        with the UDI process. I think you mentioned an AID mission there, which
                        suggests also that there were some what I might call more bilateral
                        interests in Zambia on the part of the United States. Is that a fair
                        statement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh, indeed. There were strong bilateral interests, because of American
                    participation in the copper mining industry in what was then called the
                    Copperbelt, now referred to as the Western Province. There were two major copper
                    companies, the Anglo American group and Roan Selection Trust, the latter of
                    which had strong American participation through American Metals Climax.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Sir Ronald Prain was the Chairman of Roan Selection Trust, known generally as
                    RST, and we kept fairly close contact with both RST and Anglo American
                    concerning copper production, because at that time Zambia vied with Chile for
                    first place in copper production in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the AID program focused? Can you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, the AID program was a very small one, and a very significant
                    part of it was in AID participant training. There was an AID training officer on
                    the AID staff whose name was Bill Weems. The overall program was probably in the
                    range of $2 million (project funds) annually, and much of its initial emphasis,
                    if I remember correctly, was in the fields of African agriculture and education,
                    including curriculum development. There had been considerable thought given to
                    ways of helping Zambia in the transport field. Even before I arrived, there was
                    some discussion of Zambia's desire for assistance in building a Tanzam Railway.
                    The Zambians, probably with some encouragement from the British, I believe,
                    wanted very much to have a rail connection from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to the
                    northern part of the railway that ran through the central part of Zambia from
                    what was then still Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, up to the Katanga area (now
                    the Shaba province) of Zaire (formerly the Congo). The Zambians had no rail
                    connection to any of the ports on East Africa except through Southern Rhodesia
                    and either Mozambique or South Africa.</p>
                <p>The US was not particularly eager to involve itself in such a large project and
                    was uncertain as to the economic soundness of the idea, but eventually did agree
                    to finance a study of different projects. This was taken on by the Stanford
                    Research Institute (SRI) and in time produced a series of, I think, some eight
                    volumes or more of separate studies: one concerning the railway, and one the
                    possibility of a Tanzam road connection, which indeed was the one finally chosen
                    for support by AID. Another suggested further study of an oil pipeline, which
                    was undertaken and later done with other assistance. The remaining volumes
                    covered various other aspects of the transport connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That road, if I remember right, was eventually called Hell
                        Run when it was built. Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: That was the one that was known as Hell Run during the period when
                    truckers were bringing oil and petroleum products in from Dar es Salaam by road,
                    yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if I remember right, because in my own time in Zambia
                        it was often mentioned, we did turn down the building of the Tanzam Railway.
                        It was eventually built by the Chinese. Does that go back to your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes. I think the US was inclined to discourage the project even before
                    this study, but I believe it was President Johnson who was reluctant to become
                    involved in such a major project, perhaps because of other distractions at the
                    time, such as Vietnam. But the Stanford Research Institute study did question
                    the economic viability of the railway, noting the need for a great deal of
                    upgrading at the Port of Dar es Salaam and arguing that on strict economic terms
                    it still seemed economically more viable to route exports and imports through
                    Beira, Lourenco Marques (now Maputo), and other ports in the south. There were
                    many of us who felt that this failed to take into account important political
                    factors that later did come into play. The SRI report did suggest that an
                    improved road and an oil pipeline were likely to be viable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I may ask one question on the Washington end of the
                        line before I switch over to the political-economic situation, who was most
                        concerned and from whom did the embassy more or less expect to get
                        instructions in the Washington hierarchy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Basically, it was from the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs.
                    There had been some interest by the Under Secretary for Political Affairs,
                    George Ball, though in fact it was the Bureau that was most important in terms
                    of our instructions. And of course at the time I went out, the office director
                    for the area, then known as AFE, was Jesse McKnight, and we had quite regular
                    communication</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Mr. Ambassador, let's switch over to something more
                        about the political-economic situation that you found when you arrived
                        there. You have already mentioned copper. To what extent was Zambia
                        dependent upon the south, namely Southern Rhodesia at the time, and South
                        Africa, for its economy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, one has to go back in history a bit and recognize that Northern
                    Rhodesia had been in effect discovered and developed from the south. It was part
                    of Cecil Rhodes' expansions. Essentially, the mineral discoveries, mines, and
                    the mining industry, were all developed from the south. Also a considerable
                    number of emigrants came up from South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Many of the
                    South Africans were in fact Afrikaans-speaking South Africans. Zambia's major
                    economic ties, therefore, were with the south, both Southern Rhodesia and South
                    Africa. The Anglo American Corporation, despite its name (which came from a
                    major loan raised in the US many years ago, was and still is a South African
                    company with no American connection. Roan Selection Trust or RST, which does
                    have an American connection, was known originally as the Rhodesian Selection
                    Trust and was essentially concerned with Southern Rhodesia as well as Northern
                    Rhodesia. Also, the railroad in Zambia had been built as an extension up from
                    Southern Rhodesia across the river at Livingstone near the Victoria Falls. This
                    gave Zambia connections from Southern Rhodesia to Beira, which was important as
                    the port of entry for petroleum products and other imports, as well as south to
                    Lourenco Marques (now Maputo) in Mozambique, and both directly and through
                    Botswana to South Africa. The latter connection crosses the Zimbabwe-Botswana
                    border at Plumtree and enters South Africa from southern Botswana.</p>
                <p>Thus, Zambia's main connection was almost exclusively southward in the beginning,
                    although there was a fair amount of communication across from the Copperbelt to
                    Elisabethville in the Katanga (now Shaba) province of Zaire, so there was a
                    relationship there as well. But basically, it was oriented to the south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That included banking, if I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh, yes, very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it also included importation of some of the better
                        things of life like food, at least for the expatriates, and other
                        goodies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, at least in part. Zambia produced a good deal of its own local
                    produce. It had, in fact, a pretty good marketing system of local producers of
                    vegetables. But it did import meat from Botswana and other food products from
                    the south. Things like breakfast foods were those that were produced in South
                    Africa. Industrial goods, especially mining equipment, came in from the south
                    and probably still do.</p>
                <p>You mentioned banking. I think increasingly a number of the banks were
                    establishing direct branches from Europe, though there were both South African
                    and British banks in Zambia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, on the political side of the house, Zambia then had
                        a President, Kenneth Kaunda. It had more than one political party if my
                        memory serves me right, and I wonder if you might like to comment a little
                        bit about that please.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, the leading party, the government party, was the United National
                    Independence Party, UNIP, which had earlier broken away from the Northern
                    Rhodesia African National Congress, or ANC, which was headed by Harry Nkumbula.
                    The ANC had as its main supporters a large number of the Tongas in the southern
                    province of then Northern Rhodesia, eventually Zambia. UNIP, however, had
                    started largely as a youth movement, and had recruited members from throughout
                    the country, though many accused UNIP of being dominated by Bembas. President
                    Kaunda was himself not a member of any major tribe, since his parents had come
                    originally from a small tribe in Malawi. Nonetheless, there were tribal as well
                    as political divisions. The old line nationalists, such as Harry Nkumbula and
                    others, had been with the ANC, but many of those split away and helped form the
                    first cabinet that President Kaunda led.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To pursue President Kaunda himself. He is, of course, one
                        of Africa's longest standing political figures today. What were the
                        relations between him and Ambassador Good, and by derivation, yourself? And
                        what was your judgment of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, the relationships were good. They were not as frequent as
                    certainly Ambassador Good would have liked to have had. He constantly wished he
                    could have a feet-up-on-the-table conversation with President Kaunda, which
                    never seemed to take place. People who had known Kaunda before would come to
                    town and go out to State House and have dinner and talk about these nice long
                    political conversations. But the calls that Bob Good had were essentially
                    business calls. Kaunda was friendly, outgoing, receptive to ideas and
                    discussion, but didn't seem to let his hair down in quite the way that Bob Good
                    thought would have led to better understanding of deeper problems in the future.
                    I think he saw—it would be hard to say now—but probably he saw Kaunda every
                    month or two as well as, of course, seeing him at frequent ceremonies either at
                    State House or elsewhere.</p>
                <p>I had a reasonably good relationship as well, though only when I was Charg� or at
                    other times when I saw Kaunda perhaps at the airport or various ceremonies. He
                    was friendly the times that I went to see him. Again, he was businesslike, but
                    receptive to ideas. I remember once taking up a human rights problem at my own
                    initiative—it was a case some tourists had seen in which a young Zambian woman
                    acting as their official guide was beaten up by a group of young men in the
                    market because her dress was too short (or something of that sort)—and I simply
                    raised this with Kaunda as a situation where the lack of police action to
                    protect the woman or arrest her attackers would not be understood by people from
                    the outside. (The attackers were allegedly UNIP party supporters.) He seemed
                    quite concerned and indicated that he would try to do something about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else in the government besides the President was a
                        power? The Foreign Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, certainly the Foreign Minister. The first Foreign Minister that
                    I dealt with was Simon Kapwepwe, who was extremely important and later became
                    Vice President. Well after I left the scene, however, Kapwepwe ran into some
                    difficulty with Kaunda and the party. But at the time I was there, he was
                    particularly important. The Vice President also seemed of some importance,
                    though it was difficult to know just how much at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, to what extent did Kaunda share foreign
                        policy considerations with Kapwepwe? Or, put another way, which of the two
                        did you and the Ambassador see more often on foreign policy matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, I think we saw Kapwepwe certainly more often than the President,
                    but I would say the President exercised the strongest influence or direction,
                    and one had the feeling that within the cabinet or within party circles Kapwepwe
                    and the President worked very closely. There were often rumors of some kind of
                    rivalry between the two. We certainly discounted these at the time and didn't
                    particularly feel that there was a pull away from the basic thrust that Kaunda
                    wanted, although we did feel then that Kapwepwe was probably more inclined than
                    Kaunda was to be sympathetic to the Soviet Union, China, and other bloc
                    countries, despite the importance of nonalignment to Zambia's foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To go back to Kaunda himself a little bit, he adopted, if
                        I recall correctly, a philosophy called humanism. He was also a rather
                        emotional man. Could you comment on both of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, there was a series of books that came out about humanism. some
                    of them while I was there. The first, I think, was called A Humanist in Africa,
                    written by Kaunda with assistance from a Methodist minister. The Methodists had
                    joined with a few other churches to form the United Church of Zambia. This
                    particular minister was Colin Morris who was from the Copperbelt and had known
                    Kaunda for some time. They had become good friends and were both interested in a
                    liberal philosophy.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>The title “humanism”—I'm not sure where it came from—was unfortunate to the
                    extent that it used the same name (and may have given the impression of being
                    the same) as a much earlier body of philosophical thought that is generally
                    referred to (and much argued about in our educational system today) as
                    secularism. In Kaunda's mind, however, I think humanism probably meant little
                    more than placing a first and primary emphasis on the dignity of individual
                    human beings, although there is certainly an African content to his writing that
                    emphasizes the importance of the human sense of community in a very African way.
                    While one gets this from reading his books, one also senses that, as with many
                    philosophies, there are frequent problems of inconsistencies and conflict
                    between the theory and practice of humanism. But I think that as far as
                    President Kaunda was concerned, then and now, his ideas of humanism are a very
                    genuine and serious part of his outlook on life, which is probably what has made
                    Kaunda so attractive to such a wide variety of people. It is a kind of sincerity
                    of interest he appears to have in doing what he feels is best for the largest
                    number of people, especially for the people of Zambia and, in a broader sense,
                    Africa. The fact that these feelings may be highly subjective makes them no less
                    sincere.</p>
                <p>I believe that Kaunda's philosophy has made him see other sides of questions, and
                    though he has very firm ideas on certain basic human problems, he has always had
                    a willingness, I think, to sit down and talk to the other side. This is a very
                    useful and healthy attribute to have for diplomacy, and it evidenced itself a
                    number of times later in connection with negotiations on Southern Rhodesia and
                    relationships with South Africa on the Namibia problem and similar issues.</p>
                <p>As nearly everybody knows, Kaunda cries often during his public speeches and some
                    other ceremonies, but I have no reason to believe that these expressions of
                    emotion are not genuine, even when they seem in conflict or inconsistent with
                    his failure to criticize acts by some of his supporters. He seems a genuinely
                    emotional man.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and the Ambassador find access in general to
                        Zambians, beginning with the President and throughout the government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, in the first place we found—and I should put it more in terms of
                    my own experience, but we discussed it very, very often—that the Zambians tended
                    to be somewhat introverted and reserved with regard to foreigners of all kinds.
                    It wasn't a particularly racial or cultural thing, and I later found during my
                    time there that some Africans, African diplomats from other states, often had
                    the same kind of experience with Zambians.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>My last post had been in West Africa where there is a very outgoing society, a
                    very extroverted society, and I found it interesting to make some cultural and
                    political comparisons between that and Zambia. In Ghana, for instance,
                    nonalignment had been a kind of extroverted nonalignment with everybody coming
                    in. You could imagine somebody with their arms outstretched saying “come in,
                    come in.” One can always argue as to what treatment was accorded to those who
                    were being invited to come, but that's a different issue. In the case of Zambia
                    one had the feeling that those arms were outstretched with the palms facing
                    outward. Everybody stay out, stay out. Perhaps that's too extreme, but the
                    parallel that I drew was one between extroverted nonalignment and introverted
                    nonalignment. In other words, in West Africa, I had found that they wanted the
                    Americans in, they wanted the Soviets, they wanted the Chinese. In Zambia, on
                    the other hand, while some of the typically good African hospitality existed as
                    elsewhere in the continent, the Zambians seemed in many respects equally
                    suspicious of the Soviets, the Chinese, the Americans, or the British. They
                    still looked on the British with feelings of anti-colonialism, of course, yet in
                    many respects they knew and admired the British and would refer to them as “the
                    devil you know.” So there was a great deal of respect for the British, but there
                    was also a considerable amount of distrust going back to the colonial
                    period.</p>
                <p>If you go back even earlier in history, what I think you find is that the
                    Zambians always seemed to be in the middle of crisscrossing migrations of people
                    even before European colonists ever came. People were always coming into Zambia
                    from somewhere else, and if you were already there, you got pushed and shoved
                    around, all of which led to the development of a fairly healthy concern for not
                    giving way to outsiders.</p>
                <p>I may be putting too much into this, but I do believe that the Zambians had
                    developed this kind of reserve toward outsiders, and that it was possibly
                    reinforced, as they took over the reins of a new, independent government, with a
                    concern that they find out how to do things themselves. They obviously looked
                    particularly to the British for assistance and advice, but I think that you
                    frequently ran into situations where they didn't want to be told how to do
                    something. They wanted to find it out for themselves, and various anecdotes come
                    to mind where normal presentations that a diplomat might make to get Zambian
                    officials to understand and perhaps adopt a particular position on an
                    international issue would be regarded with suspicion because they felt it was up
                    to them to determine their own position without necessarily listening to
                    somebody else.</p>
                <p>Access was difficult at times because of this reserve or suspicion. I don't want
                    to overemphasize the suspicion nor underemphasize the friendliness that you got
                    from individual Zambians, particularly I think, from those who had traveled or
                    gone to school abroad, of which there were very few in the early years, of
                    course. [I believe much of this changed as Zambians became more experienced and
                    confident in self-government.]</p>

                </p>
                <p>This is Side 2 of my interview with Ambassador Edmondson.Given what you have just
                    said, did you and the Ambassador find that dialogue with the Zambians flowed
                    rather freely, that there was a good understanding of the positions of the two
                    countries when you discussed matters with them?</p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, I think there was a reasonable understanding. There was this
                    reserve when it came to matters of direct interest internationally as well as
                    bilaterally. But I think that the Zambians appreciated the US position of
                    support for Zambia both before and, of course, after UDI. This included support
                    for helping Zambia find ways to maintain itself in spite of sanctions against
                    Southern Rhodesia. I think they saw this as genuine, as necessary to them, and
                    helpful. This made access much easier on certain occasions. On the whole, I
                    believe we had little difficulty in discussing international political issues
                    with them, although they were at times very reserved about taking positions
                    (especially ones of agreement with us) on any faraway matter that they thought
                    could affect their nonalignment.</p>
                <p>I can recall one instance of really good access. I happened to be Charg� at the
                    time our former Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, G. Mennen (Soapy)
                    Williams, came on a visit to Zambia. This made it possible to invite people who
                    normally didn't go out very often to foreigners' homes to come see Governor
                    Williams again. He had visited earlier—I believe it was about 1961—and became
                    very well known in Zambia because it was in Lusaka, just as he was getting off
                    the plane, that some white settler rushed up on the steps and socked him on the
                    jaw. The reason for the attack was a speech Williams had made earlier in the
                    trip expounding for the first time his policy slogan of “Africa for the
                    Africans!” That certainly made him very popular with the Zambians, and the
                    incident stuck in their minds. It established a relationship that helped
                    Americans in many ways by illustrating the sincerity of our anticolonialism and
                    our support for African aspirations for self government and for economic
                    development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were other countries represented in Lusaka at the
                        time, most particularly the British. How large was the diplomatic corps then
                        and were there interests on the part of other countries besides the
                        British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, the British had by far the largest mission, but all of the other
                    diplomatic missions were limited to 25 people on the staff. I can recall that
                    there were Germans, French, Chinese. The Israelis were prominent in assisting
                    Zambia at the time. And the Russians, of course, had a fairly good sized
                    diplomatic mission. I'd have to go back and check our diplomatic list at the
                    time, but the diplomatic corps was much larger, for instance, than you would
                    find in South Africa today.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find our relations with the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Our relationships with the British were extremely good and close. We
                    had regular consultations with them. We worked cooperatively on trying to find
                    ways to assist Zambia in overcoming the problems of sanctions against Southern
                    Rhodesia. There were times when each party probably felt the other could do
                    more. I think the British did provide a lot of assistance to Zambia in terms of
                    rolling stock on the railway originally, for trucks, for road maintenance and
                    repairs, and a number of other things for preparing for UDI.</p>
                <p>There was a period immediately before UDI—when it looked like it would in fact
                    take place—that we began surveying almost every day of the week how many tons
                    could be brought in by one of the various road routes—the Great East Road, the
                    Great North Road, and so on—because it would affect very much what kinds of
                    assistance would be needed. The British clearly led this effort by providing
                    people to the Zambian government to work on their emergency preparations and by
                    providing the financing. Other countries, of course, were interested, but
                    particularly the United States and Canada.</p>
                <p>When UDI in fact came and the consequent oil embargo resulted in the Southern
                    Rhodesians cutting off any transit of oil up to Zambia, we had a real emergency.
                    This was in the Fall—November and December—of 1965. And just after Christmas
                    they began rationing petrol. I can remember vividly that for the first five week
                    rationing period we had four imperial gallons of gasoline for each vehicle. That
                    was very difficult. I happened to have had hepatitis right after Christmas and
                    was home on my back for nearly a month, so I didn't suffer as much from the
                    transport problem as others did. But in preparation for this I can remember
                    buying bicycles for myself and my wife. Our two children already had bikes. And
                    during the period that I was home, my wife had to do her shopping by bicycle to
                    the nearest shopping center, which was about a mile or so away.</p>
                <p>In the second period I think the ration went up to six imperial gallons for a
                    month. Eventually it went to eight and then ten, and then we thought we were in
                    very good straits when we finally got 14 imperial gallons a month. The reason
                    the ration increased was that we, along with the British and the Canadians, had
                    instituted an airlift of gasoline and other petroleum products from different
                    ports around.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Prior to that, I should say, we worked very hard in anticipation of the need for
                    such an airlift. It had been discussed, but no one had made any commitments. AID
                    had sent a man out (Ed Hogan, I think his name was). I think this was in early
                    December, 1965 and I can remember working late nights figuring what would be
                    necessary and working with the AID representative to get agreement on what the
                    US would contribute. Eventually the decision was to use a Boeing 707 to bring
                    products down from Kinshasa to Elisabethville and then have them brought over by
                    rail from there to the Copperbelt and onward via the Zambian rail system. That
                    was the American contribution, and with the 707's we could carry very large
                    amounts of petroleum compared to the L100 or the C-130 military version of the
                    Lockheed Hercules aircraft that was being used by the Canadians. Their air force
                    C-130's were flying all the way to Lusaka from Kinshasa. And the British were
                    using smaller civilian aircraft, the equivalent of a DC6B (the Britannia, I
                    believe it was called), from Dar-es-Salaam to Lusaka. The increasing amount of
                    oil supplies brought that way permitted an increase in rations throughout.
                    During this same period, also, work had begun on a pipeline which eventually
                    relieved the pressure on Zambia in the petroleum field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it fair to assume that from the time that you arrived
                        in early 1965, much of Kaunda's preoccupations were with Southern African
                        matters, particularly with Southern Rhodesia and the impending UDI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Especially UDI, yes. He believed very strongly that the British should
                    take firm military action in the event that UDI should occur, and the British
                    more or less telegraphed their lack of punch by saying that they would not use
                    military force. Prime Minister Wilson made that very clear, and I think removed
                    any element of doubt that might have been entertained in Southern Rhodesia. It's
                    my opinion, and certainly I think it was the opinion of the Zambians, that this
                    simply encouraged the Southern Rhodesians to proceed with the UDI. There had
                    been some question as to whether the loyalty of the Rhodesian military would
                    have been to the crown or to the Southern Rhodesian government, but as it turned
                    out, there wasn't any question and there wasn't any threat to the Smith
                    regime.</p>
                <p>The British did send in a squadron of jet fighters which were stationed in Lusaka
                    for a while and would occasionally zoom over the city, but after—I've forgotten
                    now—6 or 8 weeks perhaps, maybe less, the Zambians felt that the aircraft were
                    doing no good, that they weren't a threat to the Rhodesians, and that they
                    weren't particularly necessary for protection of Zambia. In fact, they may have
                    suspected ulterior motives on the part of the British—of what sort are unclear,
                    but in any event they asked the British to remove their jets and take them back
                    to the UK, which they did.</p>
                <p>I think it was during this period that one of the Zambian politicians who had
                    served as the Zambian High Commissioner in London used the phrase “The Toothless
                    Bulldog” to refer to the British for their lack of any action against the
                    Southern Rhodesians.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>We did get into a period where the British, some of the British officers at the
                    High Commission at least, seemed to be critical of the Zambians for not
                    participating more thoroughly in sanctions themselves. This was because the
                    Zambians continued to allow certain supplies to come in from Southern Rhodesia
                    even after UDI and during the period of sanctions on petroleum and other
                    products. The British argued that Zambia should apply sanctions more completely
                    even though the Zambians felt this would only destroy their own economy. There
                    was a continuing argument between them on this, and I must say I think we felt
                    some sympathy for the Zambians. There was a certain feeling among people in
                    Zambia that the British criticism of Zambia's failure to apply sanctions
                    completely was designed in part to temper Zambian criticism of the lack of
                    British action. In other words, there was some sort of an impasse, though
                    cooperation did continue on bringing things into Zambia. Nonetheless, I think
                    this period of charges and counter charges represented a low point in the
                    Zambian-British relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole issue of UDI was primarily played out between
                        the British and not only Zambia but, of course, the Southern Rhodesians, and
                        to some extent the South Africans. You mentioned the US role in helping to
                        supply or helping break the oil embargo. Did we have other roles to play
                        during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Basically, no. I think we did try to encourage a sensible attitude on
                    the part of the Zambians in preserving their industry, the copper industry. We
                    looked at different possibilities for assistance with the importation of
                    coal—for instance, whether they could have used the coal fields in the southern
                    province of Zambia, but the quality of coal there proved insufficient to
                    substitute for the coal that had been received from the Wankie coal fields of
                    Southern Rhodesia. Also, efforts were made to convert from the use of coal to
                    the use of oil in the smelter furnaces up on the Copperbelt, so we were
                    concerned with that sort of thing as well.</p>
                <p>Also, we certainly continued our economic assistance in agriculture, education,
                    things like government cost minimization, and participant training in various
                    fields not necessarily related to the political situation or to UDI. We found
                    that the Zambians were interested in what went on in South Africa, but at that
                    time it still was fairly remote from their basic concern with what was going on
                    in Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If my memory serves me right, there was at least one
                        instance of a rather serious demonstration against the embassy. Do you
                        recall that and could you tell us a little bit about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, this goes back though to the domestic situation in the United
                    States. You have to remember that we're now observing the two decades that have
                    passed since the disturbances here in Washington in 1968. The assassination of
                    Robert Kennedy was what triggered this particular demonstration. Beyond that, we
                    were never quite sure just who stimulated the demonstration or why, except
                    perhaps that it was just high emotion or the feeling that there were groups in
                    the United States that were anti-black, and anti-African, and must somehow have
                    been behind the assassination of Robert Kennedy. We were never able to establish
                    how it began. The demonstration was small and rather short lived. There was a
                    picture in the paper the next day of Ambassador Good and me standing out in
                    front of the embassy, looking rather angry, confronting this group. But
                    essentially it was peaceful; nothing was thrown. There were some shouts and
                    placards, but it was simply a demonstration of concern at a situation that was
                    clearly difficult in the United States at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back now, Mr. Ambassador, what would you feel were
                        your most satisfying accomplishments when you were in Zambia and conversely
                        your greatest disappointment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I think the accomplishments were mainly those of making a contribution
                    to getting Zambia through this difficult period. Many, many people contributed
                    to that, and it took a lot of work, a lot of coordination, consultations, and
                    discussions with Zambians and British and other allies who were concerned. We
                    spent a lot of late nights trying to get information back to Washington on what
                    Zambian needs were, and while much of this would appear quite minute now—that
                    is, the minutiae and details that we reported back—they were essential parts of
                    a general effort to give the support that Zambia so much needed. The fact that
                    this was of considerable help gave us a feeling of accomplishment.</p>
                <p>Another accomplishment was the gradual improvement in our own situation as far as
                    the embassy was concerned. We started out in a commercial building downtown—on
                    the second floor of Chester House on Cairo Road—with the AID officers in another
                    building and the CAMO office in a storefront location nearby, and a tiny
                    garage-sized warehouse further away. These were not very good circumstances. I
                    think my office was perhaps 8 feet by 10 feet at the most. During this period,
                    we constructed a new building, a very pleasant building which, with subsequent
                    additions, looks very nice today and seems to serve the embassy well. How great
                    it was to move into that new building and have better offices! We persuaded
                    President Kaunda to come and officially open the chancery, which pleased us very
                    much. That too was an accomplishment. It was an accomplishment of many, many
                    people. I think our administrative services also gradually improved, and we were
                    able to institute useful internal guidelines and regulations.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I do recall when I first arrived going over to the little garage size warehouse
                    and being taken aback by a great pile of supplies on the floor, completely mixed
                    up and not properly accounted for. Although we had a great deal of difficulty
                    establishing controls, we were able in time to improve them greatly. We improved
                    our communications tremendously over this period. Obviously, rapid
                    communications were important to the kind of work that we were doing, but when
                    we started out, we had one communicator working in a miserable situation like a
                    “black hole of Calcutta.” When he had to use his incinerator, the smoke went
                    around his whole communications center. In our new chancery, we had a fairly
                    modern communication center that permitted us not only to transmit messages for
                    ourselves, but occasionally to help the Zambians in emergencies—and I think
                    maybe even the British a time or two. To me, that kind of improvement in our
                    staff, our facilities, and our procedures represented a considerable
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <p>The last 7 months of my time there, I was Charg� because Ambassador Good decided
                    to resign right after the November 1968 election. He wanted to go back to
                    academic life and he didn't want to wait until a replacement came, so he left
                    sometime in early December 1968, I believe it was, and his replacement, Oliver
                    Troxel, was not named for several months. Troxel finally arrived either in late
                    May or early June of 1969. There was quite a long period during which I was
                    Charg� and had to deal with a number of matters that were routine, but important
                    to our operations continuing—mostly little problems of aid, questions of post
                    management and administrative operations, handling visitors, doing reporting,
                    and of course, maintaining good relations with the Zambian government. Doing so
                    and doing so successfully was a rewarding personal accomplishment.</p>
                <p>The period toward the end was at times tedious. We went through an election, I
                    recall, and I had to do a fair amount of reporting. We did have a very small
                    staff, and it required a lot of late evenings and hard work. But I can't, as I
                    look back now, remember any major disappointments. It was a time of pretty
                    steady achievement, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question has to do with general every day living.
                        Did you find living fairly pleasant? Were you able to get around the
                        countryside and see much of Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I got to see a lot in some respects, but not nearly as much as I would
                    have liked, because of the constant preoccupation we had with operational
                    matters—certainly during the airlift—and we couldn't travel during that period.
                    But I did get over to the eastern province and into Malawi, down as far as
                    Blantyre, on one trip. On one occasion that is memorable to me still, Ambassador
                    Good and I traveled with our families to see the Kuomboka, the annual ceremony
                    at which the paramount chief, or Litunga, of the Barotse tribal group (in which
                    the Lozi are the main tribe), goes by barge from his winter capital on the
                    inundated flood plain of the upper Zambezi to his summer village headquarters on
                    higher ground, some miles away. A very interesting ceremony.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>I got up to the Copperbelt a couple of times, and down to Livingstone to see the
                    falls, as well as to see people in the Livingstone area and Kariba—that sort of
                    thing. But there just wasn't time to get to many of the areas, or to do a lot of
                    the business traveling one would normally do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was living in Lusaka reasonably comfortable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, living was comfortable. Zambia has a delightful climate really.
                    Perhaps only one month of the year, October, is terribly hot. People often
                    called it the suicide month, but if you come from the Washington area or from
                    Nebraska as I did, you didn't find it too bad. It's a dry heat and while indeed
                    it was hot, it was still very pleasant and fairly cool in the evenings. And the
                    cold season very rarely would get down to freezing, perhaps a frost
                    occasionally. But most of the year is the kind of weather where people can play
                    golf or tennis, and it's a good climate for family life. We had a good school
                    situation at that time. I was in Zambia just earlier this year and found that
                    it's still a very pleasant place to live, as far as climate and geography go. If
                    one can get supplies, especially food and other necessities, it can be very
                    pleasant.</p>
                <p>We had two different houses while I was there. One was a house designed and built
                    by a South African who used a voortrekker theme of wagon wheels shapes,
                    cathedral type windows, and a round central lounge. It looked rather interesting
                    from the outside. It was very, very nice for large scale entertaining. The
                    bedrooms were comfortable, but the living room was a little bit large to enjoy
                    yourself in just as a family. Then we moved after two years to the former
                    Ghanaian High Commissioner's house which we rented from the Ghanaians after they
                    broke relations with Zambia. That was only about a block and a half from our new
                    chancery. That was extremely pleasant, very comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, if I may now take you to an earlier period
                        of your career when you were in Tanganyika, today Tanzania, could you
                        contrast a little bit for us your experiences there with those you later had
                        in Zambia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, that was, of course, a different time and almost a different
                    world from the Africa of today and the Africa of even just a few years after the
                    time that I was in Dar es Salaam. I had been working on trusteeship affairs in
                    the Department before I joined the Foreign Service proper, so I was familiar
                    with the trust territories, particularly with Tanganyika and with other parts of
                    Africa. So I was very interested and excited when I received my first assignment
                    to Dar es Salaam.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>We arrived there in February 1953 at an airport that consisted of thatched
                    buildings, thatched roof and sides, and one had the feeling that you were really
                    arriving in deepest, darkest Africa. We drove into town and were put up at what
                    was then called the New Africa Hotel. It's now referred to probably as the old
                    New Africa because it has been replaced by a newer building. It had been the
                    Kaiserhof in German days, an interesting place with wide balconies and rooms
                    that opened almost completely to the outside. You had to duck behind a 3-foot
                    square pillar to dress in the evening if you didn't want to be seen by the
                    people on the second floor of the house across the street.</p>
                <p>The consulate was in a building called the Cable and Wireless building on a side
                    street right across from the post office, about a block and a half from the
                    hotel. The staff was small. There was a Consul—the Consul had left just the day
                    before I arrived—a Vice Consul that I was replacing, and an American secretary.
                    That was the American staff. There was a British stenographer. A young Eurasian
                    girl was the file clerk, and three barefoot African messengers did the char work
                    and odd jobs. It was a tiny staff that had to do a little bit of everything, but
                    little in great depth. I remember we did our own ciphering and deciphering of
                    the few telegraphic messages that we sent or received. Most of the telegraphic
                    messages were on urgent administrative matters or sometimes consular questions.
                    As I think of the two and a half years that I was there, I can recall only one
                    political telegram that we sent. Most of our communications were dispatches, as
                    they were still called in those days, and we had one courier pouch a month.</p>
                <p>The major political interest the United States had in the country was in its
                    status as a UN trust territory, because it came up in the sessions of the
                    Trusteeship Council, and we were interested in furthering its progress toward
                    self government and eventual independence. So our major political work was to
                    monitor government activity and political events affecting the country's
                    progress toward self government.</p>
                <p>Our economic interest was largely in trade, particularly in the US importation of
                    sisal. We were interested also in cashew nuts, but in fact those were exported
                    first to India where they were processed for re-export to the United States.
                    There was some production of diamonds and cotton, a small production of gold in
                    the northwest, coffee on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and tea in the Southern
                    Highlands province of Tanganyika, as it was known then.</p>
                <p>During the period that I was there, the Vice Consul that I replaced was called
                    away after about a month to rejoin the former Consul, who had left on transfer
                    to the Consulate in Port Elizabeth, South Africa the day before I arrived in Dar
                    es Salaam. I was left alone in charge of the post for about a month and had to
                    do a lot of late night reading of the Foreign Affairs Manual, the Foreign
                    Service Manual I think it was still called then, to figure out how to handle
                    passport applications, visas and so on, though we certainly had little consular
                    work to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Most of the consular work was in renewing passports or issuing passports to
                    American missionaries up country. There were very few Americans in Dar es
                    Salaam. I think besides those who were stationed at the consulate itself there
                    was one person there on an academic grant doing some scholarly work. There was
                    an American manager of the CALTEX Petroleum Company who was there with his wife
                    for a short time, and a woman of Greek origin who had a claim to American
                    citizenship. That was it. We had very few visa applications, some but not many,
                    and a fair amount of our time was spent on consular invoices that were required
                    in those days for sisal and other goods shipped to the United States.</p>
                <p>That gave us time to do political reporting, and the nationalist movement was
                    still a nascent one. Julius Nyerere had just returned as a teacher in a Catholic
                    high school near Dar es Salaam. He had received his Ph.D. at Edinburgh
                    University, had begun some political organizing, and was considered to be a
                    rather radical activist by the colonial government. The Governor was Sir Edward
                    Twining, a rather pompous looking man but an effective governor. There was an
                    executive council and a legislative council performing the roles of a cabinet
                    and a parliament, if you will, of a modern society, but as colonial
                    versions.</p>
                <p>The Chief Secretary was in effect a kind of Prime Minister of the government and
                    an important figure, as were such officials as the Member for Local Government
                    and other Executive Council Members, Provincial and District Commissioners, and
                    so on. It was a regular colonial set-up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were all British?</hi>

                <p>EDMONDSON: They were all British. There was one great sign of progress at the
                    time, one African district officer, but not a district commissioner yet. The
                    British were very proud of his having achieved that status. We Americans were
                    known generally as anti-colonialist. This was a period not long after World War
                    II and, of course, the US was regarded, I think throughout the world, as being
                    fairly anti-colonial. And while our relations were good with the British, I
                    think we clearly differed with them and they with us on our pressures toward
                    more rapid progression toward self-government.</p>
                <p>The new Consul, who arrived at the end of my month as the only officer in the
                    consulate, was Dave Marvin who had come from a post in London, but left after a
                    few months (in September 1953) to go into academic life. (He is retired now,
                    having spent many years as a professor and department head at San Francisco
                    State University.) I think it was Dave who first met Julius Nyerere and
                    introduced him to me at some public ceremony. And later on I followed up and
                    became quite well acquainted with Nyerere. I would say he was probably one of my
                    prime political contacts at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>After Marvin left, there was another hiatus before Bob McKinnon, the next Consul
                    arrived. And I think I had a period of perhaps a month or six weeks then alone
                    again in charge of the post. It was during this period that I met a lot of
                    people among the African, Asian, and European communities, who were quite
                    divided at that time. They each had their own political party. Nyerere had
                    started the Tanganyika African National Union, which was a reorganization of the
                    old Tanganyika African Association. The latter had been an association
                    consisting primarily of educated Africans and chiefs, fairly conservative or
                    moderate even, and interested of course in the advancement of Africans, but not
                    very assertive politically.. Nyerere's ideas were much more radical in the eyes
                    of the colonial administration, as his goal was to develop a real political
                    movement. In fact, one source of mine in the local government's “Special
                    Branch”—where I checked occasionally to see if anybody had a criminal record
                    before we issued a visa—told me that Nyerere had had very suspicious left wing
                    connections in Britain, including people like George Padmore. But in my own
                    conversations with Nyerere, I found him not radical in a philosophical sense at
                    all. At least in the way Americans look at political development, he simply
                    wanted for his own people what I think we all want for ourselves, and that was
                    considered rather radical at the time by those who believed firmly in the
                    colonial regime.</p>
                <p>Reporting on people and events in such times was a very, very interesting
                    occupation. One relied a little bit on the press, but there was only one major
                    newspaper. There was an Asian-owned weekly that was not very strong on political
                    matters, but the main paper was the British-owned Tanganyika Standard, somewhat
                    biased I think toward the colonial point of view and toward the European settler
                    point of view. I remember there was a European settler organization, called the
                    Tanganyika European Council, TEC, headed by a man by the name of Tom Tyrell, who
                    had some connection with the Capricorn Africa Society that was based in what was
                    to become the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Salisbury. There was also
                    an Asian association. So there was a three-way division in politics, especially
                    as there was beginning to be some movement toward the eventual establishment of
                    a legislative council that would have elected outside members as well as those
                    that were either officials or nominated by the government. Before I left, in
                    fact, Nyerere did become the first African member of a newly created legislative
                    assembly for Tanganyika.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Side 3, here with Ambassador Bill Edmondson, and
                        we're talking about his experiences in Tanganyika.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Ambassador, I take it from what you've been saying that you were able in
                    those days to have contact with Tanzanians. Was this US government policy or
                    not, and did this cause any problems with the British?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, it's difficult to say it was or wasn't a policy. I think it was
                    policy in the sense that our job was to report on political developments, and we
                    reported directly to Washington. (We did not report to or through London or any
                    other post.) We didn't have any special instruction as to whom we should see.
                    Much was left to our own judgment in those days. We had to take care or our
                    consular duties, obviously. That was a primary concern along with reporting on
                    trade and economic relationships, but to report on political developments you
                    have to talk to all kinds of elements. It wasn't all that easy at the beginning
                    to meet Africans, and I felt particularly lucky that through Dave Marvin—and I
                    don't recall now how he met Nyerere first—I met Nyerere and that he was really
                    my first and probably best political contact on the African side. But because of
                    our trust territory relationship, the fact that we were a permanent member of
                    the trusteeship council, and because Britain as the administering authority of
                    the trust territory had a responsibility to report to the trusteeship council
                    and submit annual reports and other documentation on the political progress of
                    the territory, there was a firm basis on which to ask questions and see
                    people.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, there were these three main organizations outside the colonial
                    government, and so one reported on their activities as well as on various
                    governmental operations and on such things as the budget. I can remember that
                    one major task was going to see people in the process of following a very
                    complex budget—one that involved both a capital account and a current
                    account—and trying to make sense of that and report it to Washington. But as far
                    as political contacts, there weren't any specific restrictions, although I
                    learned later quite vividly that there was a resentment of the degree to which
                    we Americans were getting out and asking questions.</p>
                <p>I can remember particularly the 1954 UN Visiting Mission. Ambassador Mason Sears
                    was the US representative on the UN trusteeship council and a member of the 1954
                    visiting mission. When he came to Dar es Salaam, I made a special effort to be
                    in touch with him. I think he came out for a meal or two at the house, and I
                    wanted to make sure that he got some of the viewpoints that we at the consulate
                    had. It was during one of the periods when I was alone that he came. I took him
                    around to see various people and sights in Dar es Salaam and used that
                    opportunity to brief him to the extent possible on the observations that I and
                    others had made of what was going on in the territory.</p>
                <p>Later on, when the visiting mission report came out, there were parts of it that
                    were very critical of the British in their administration of the territory. The
                    report came to the territory in about three copies, I understand. One of them
                    came to the consulate through, of course, the Department of State, and the
                    colonial government got at least two, one of which it gave to the Tanganyika
                    Standard which printed what in my opinion was a rather biased version, primarily
                    emphasizing those things in the report that described what the British were
                    doing that was good.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Nyerere had not seen the report, but came to see me one day with some of his
                    colleagues and noticed that I had a copy of it on a side table nearby. In fact,
                    it was open and I had been making some marginal notes on it. He asked if he
                    could borrow it, and since I had read it through and saw no reason not to do
                    so—since it was a public document—I said yes, but that I would like to have it
                    back within the next couple of days. I think that was probably on a Monday, and
                    I asked him if he could get it back to me on Thursday.</p>
                <p>In any event, he took it and he returned it a couple of days later than we had
                    agreed, but he'd had some problems, some good reason, I think, for it. But this
                    became an issue, which was exacerbated—as I discovered later on—because it was
                    during the period when I was alone and Bob McKinnon was in the United States on
                    home leave. (He had come on direct transfer and gone on home leave not long
                    afterward, then had a medical problem and was away much longer than he had
                    anticipated.) Anyway, these events also occurred during a time when both
                    Governor Sir Edward Twining and the Chief Secretary (who I had come to know
                    quite well) were away. The Acting Governor was a man by the name of Page-Jones,
                    who was normally the Member for Local Government and was one of the few members
                    of the Executive Council that I knew less well and one who always seemed more
                    critical of American activity than others.</p>
                <p>In any event, as I recall it—and much of this I heard more or less second hand
                    rather than having real documents, although some of it is documented—the
                    British, under Acting Governor Page-Jones, cabled the Colonial Office in London
                    and asked that I be declared persona non grata because of my close association
                    with Africans. The Colonial Office, reportedly at least, went to the Foreign
                    Office and passed on this recommendation, but the Foreign Office said that they
                    couldn't do this because the Americans were allies. Apparently the Foreign
                    Office thought it was ridiculous, but agreed to raise the matter in Washington.
                    In Washington the Colonial Attach�—there was such a creature in those
                    days—called the Bureau of European Affairs who didn't know anything about the
                    matter, of course, but said they would look into it. They simply listened to the
                    British bill of particulars, which I will describe in a minute, then went to the
                    Bureau of Near Eastern and African Affairs, where the Office of African Affairs
                    was located then, and AF responded that the whole thing was ridiculous.</p>
                <p>One of the accusations was that I was anti-British. Another was that I had loaned
                    Nyerere a copy of the UN visiting mission report. Of course, that was an
                    unclassified document for general distribution in the UN and there was no reason
                    that I shouldn't have loaned it to him. A third charge was that I advised
                    Nyerere (presumably on political tactics). This seems to have stemmed from a
                    number of questions that I asked different people in the process of trying to
                    get information for reporting.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>One of the questions I recall asking Nyerere and some other African leaders, as
                    well as Tom Tyrell on the European side, and some of the members of the Asian
                    Association, was whether any of them had made any effort to get in touch with
                    each other and get together on what some of their views were. This was
                    apparently reported to Special Branch in Dar es Salaam by someone—I suspect one
                    of the contacts I had in Nyerere's organization—who may have phrased it in such
                    a way as to make it seem that I was urging them to get together to oppose the
                    government, or that I was advising Nyerere in that way. In any event, that was
                    one of the British allegations.</p>
                <p>One of the more ridiculous complaints—I have this all in my records somewhere—was
                    that I had entertained Africans without having British present, which was true
                    of course, but seemed to be something the British considered improper, just not
                    done. In any event, to show that I was not anti-British, one of the desk
                    officers from our Office of African Affairs called the British Embassy colonial
                    attach� back and read to him some passages selected from some of my reports and
                    some of my comments on the visiting mission report. The desk officer read
                    sections in which I noted some errors made by the visiting mission and various
                    instances where the report had not given the British credit for some of the
                    better things they had done for the development of the territory, selections
                    that showed fairly clearly that I had been reporting objectively. I think they
                    probably didn't read to him some of my more critical comments, although I don't
                    think any of them were all that terribly critical.</p>
                <p>In any event, the issue blew over soon, maybe because I was about to be
                    transferred anyway. This was sometime in the spring of 1955, and I was really
                    quite worried about it. As it turned out, it probably did me a fair amount of
                    good in the Foreign Service because of the obviously active role I had taken in
                    political reporting. Subsequently, the Director of the Office of African Affairs
                    made a trip around Africa and was asked as one of his duties to call on Governor
                    Twining (who had returned by that time) to explain that the responsibilities of
                    our diplomatic and consular officers required us to get out and make contacts
                    and do political reporting. He stressed that I had been doing just that, and so
                    they should not be concerned at that kind of activity, especially in a UN Trust
                    Territory.</p>
                <p>The whole incident illustrates the sensitivity that existed on the part of the
                    colonial administration, at least in certain circles. I can recall among other
                    things that I had become very close friends with a British labor officer who was
                    originally stationed in Dar es Salaam and then moved up country. It was purely a
                    social relationship, although we certainly discussed things like trade unions
                    and economic development in Tanganyika. He was a great student of Swahili, and
                    he and his wife were friendly, interesting people—just a very nice couple. They
                    returned on leave to Dar es Salaam once and we invited them to stay with us. I
                    can recall that he was criticized by his own superiors for having stayed with an
                    American consular officer. I don't know what in fact transpired, but I had the
                    feeling that he must have been reprimanded at having this kind of
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>So, again, as I say, there were sensitivities to American attitudes and American
                    activities, though in fact there was nothing at all that could have been called
                    subversive from our point of view. But it was a period where elsewhere in Africa
                    other American diplomats were under similar pressures for any activities they
                    engaged in to make contacts and get political information, as you probably
                    experienced yourself in Mozambique. I recall that we had a Vice Consul who was
                    actually declared persona non grata in Leopoldville—I believe it was there—at
                    about the same time. I'm not sure of the actual time or place. But this was a
                    period—as I like to remind Africans today—during which the United States was
                    indeed an anti-colonial power supporting African aspirations for self government
                    and independence.</p>
                <p>There were other interesting things. As I mentioned, we did a little bit of
                    everything. I had arrived and found that I was to be the Assistant Disbursing
                    Officer, an assistant to the regular Disbursing Officer who was in Nairobi, so
                    that meant that I had to do the monthly accounts. I can recall the first month's
                    accounting that I did. The Vice Consul that I was replacing was about to leave
                    and was to close out his last month of accounts, but when he started to work on
                    them he closed the safe on his middle finger and cut off the tip. I took him to
                    the hospital and found myself having to close out the accounts alone. So I
                    learned the hard way about vouchers and fiscal management. It stood me in very
                    good stead later on.</p>
                <p>There were other administrative duties. We were building two residences at the
                    time, one for the Consul, one for the Vice Consul. After spending about six
                    weeks in the New Africa Hotel, my wife and I moved into a British businessman's
                    flat for two or three weeks to “house-warm,” as they called it in those days.
                    Then finally, after my predecessor left and our effects had arrived, we moved
                    into an apartment on Windsor Street, a fairly small place on the second floor
                    above a travel agency— which is still there incidentally, Kearsley's Travel
                    Agency—in an area where there were tin roofs all around us. I can remember cats
                    fighting and howling on the hot nights—literally, cats on a hot tin roof. Lots
                    of noise, lots of activity. Eventually, when the Consul and his wife, the
                    Marvins, left and there was to be a period of two months or so before the next
                    Consul arrived, we had reached the point with the construction of the two new
                    residences where it was fairly certain that the Consul's residence would be
                    ready for them when they came. So I moved into the rented house that the Consul
                    had lived in. Later, they finished the Vice Consul's house as well, and we moved
                    into that.</p>
                <p>The original Consul's residence that we built became the residence of the Deputy
                    Chief of Mission when an embassy was established. The Vice Consul's residence
                    became the residence of the embassy's political counselor for some years, and
                    just this year (1988) was converted into an American embassy community club.
                    It's only a few houses away from the DCM residence atop the coral cliffs of
                    Oyster Bay, the northern residential area of Dar es Salaam.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I mentioned earlier that we had to do our own deciphering of incoming messages. I
                    can recall vividly on one occasion, just before Christmas, getting several
                    unclassified telegrams in a row saying that we would soon receive an urgent
                    classified telegram that we were to act upon as soon as possible. Then came a
                    very long message, classified secret, and I spent a great deal of time
                    deciphering it. And because long messages were segmented in parts that were
                    transmitted in randomly mixed sequence, it was only when I was close to the end
                    that I discovered that it was President Eisenhower's speech on the lighting of
                    the White House Christmas tree. Why it had been classified so highly I don't
                    know, except that it was not for release until delivery. By the time that I had
                    deciphered it, however, I think he had already given the speech and it could
                    just as well have been sent to us unclassified. I trotted off to the weekly
                    newspaper and managed to get them to publish the full text which might have been
                    seen as a great accomplishment for what was later to be USIS. I didn't have such
                    good luck with the daily paper.</p>
                <p>We also did such things as get scholarships going. I'd had the interesting
                    experience of having worked, while I was still in the Department's Trusteeship
                    Division, to get approval for an American offer to the Trusteeship Council of
                    scholarships for the trust territories, then later conducting the first
                    competition to select candidates from Tanganyika for that same scholarship
                    program, and seeing a young man go off to the United States for his university
                    education. This was a man who later on, as he came back from the United States
                    and I was in Switzerland, came to visit us in Bern.</p>
                <p>In that and many other ways our tour in Dar es Salaam was very exciting. Lots was
                    going on. There was political activity to follow. To the north of us in Kenya,
                    the Mau-Mau conflict was going on, and once—I think it was the occasion of the
                    one political telegram I mentioned earlier—some of the Mau-Mau crossed the
                    border into Tanganyika.</p>
                <p>We did some traveling around the country. We had two children born in
                    Dar-es-Salaam. It was about four months after our daughter—our first child—was
                    born, that we went about 2,500 miles in our Jeep stationwagon around the
                    territory. We drove up to the northern border and into Kenya, where we saw Lake
                    Amboseli and Mt. Kilimanjaro from the north, spent some time in the area of
                    Moshi and Arusha, then drove out across the Rift Valley to Ngorongoro and back
                    to the main road down through Dodoma and the central part of Tanganyika as far
                    south as Iringa and some of the tea estates south of there. We came back to Dar
                    es Salaam across a new road that was being built with AID assistance—a road that
                    years later became a part of the Tanzam highway to Zambia.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I traveled to Tanga and visited a number of sisal estates. I was one of the first
                    two paying passengers out of the then new port of Mtwara in the southern
                    province of Tanganyika, along with the Director of Grain Storage, a man by the
                    name of George Rulf, whom I had come to know well because of his marriage to
                    Kate Greenway, who had been secretary to the first American Consul in Dar es
                    Salaam. He was going on an official trip, so I accompanied him and made a number
                    of official calls of my own, reporting about the new port and other developments
                    in the south. We traveled by coastal steamer from Mtwara north to Lindi, where
                    we disembarked and remained a day or so before flying back to Dar es Salaam.</p>
                <p>Lots of memories flow back from that time, but I'm not sure that they would
                    interest everyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dar es Salaam itself has an interesting name. It stands
                        for...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Haven of peace. Yes, it was a fascinating harbor, a very beautiful one
                    with a very, very narrow entrance. The tide rushes in and out through that
                    harbor entrance and makes it a difficult one to navigate for some of the ships
                    that come in and out. They used to have many ships standing outside waiting to
                    come in because of the long turnaround time required for cargo handling by
                    “lighters”—smaller vessels and barges used to move goods between ships anchored
                    in the middle of the harbor and the docks on shore. They started building two
                    deep water births, which were nearly complete when I finished my tour there, and
                    so ships were eventually able to come right alongside the docks, and commerce
                    increased. But even those facilities are now much overtaxed I'm told.</p>
                <p>There's an interesting dhow harbor further into the bay, beyond the main harbor,
                    where one could see the ancient Arab dhows that came in from Zanzibar and all
                    the way from Muscat and Oman, along with the monsoons. The dhows have been
                    coming literally for centuries to trade with the east coast of Africa. Dhows are
                    very well known, of course, in Zanzibar. Zanzibar at that time was a separate
                    protectorate. It was later incorporated with Tanganyika into the new independent
                    nation of Tanzania, but Zanzibar was always an interesting part of the scene. We
                    later established a separate consulate on Zanzibar. Historically, in fact, the
                    first American consulate on the east African coast had been on the island of
                    Zanzibar from about 1837, I believe, to about 1912. I'm not sure of the exact
                    dates now, but it was not until the 1960's that a consulate was reestablished
                    there. But the island was noted for its export of cloves and it was a
                    fascinating place to visit even in the mid 1950's.</p>
                <p>I mentioned the dhows. North of Dar es Salaam one could find an old cemetery, a
                    centuries-old Persian cemetery, with some of the gravestones still mostly
                    intact. These had been coated with an egg tempura mixture to give them a slick
                    patina and make them last longer. Many had been decorated with inset Persian
                    plates, some of which remained and could still be seen in 1955.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>One could drive into the Pugu Hills, inland from Dar es Salaam—I can remember
                    going to see Nyerere out at St. Francis College there, about ten or twelve miles
                    west of Dar-es-Salaam. It was enough higher than the coast to give one a hint of
                    cool breeze and a little relief from the humidity of the hot season. It made a
                    pleasant outing. It was always pleasant to go “up country.” Another spot of
                    special interest was Morogoro, a town about a hundred miles inland. There was a
                    little boarding house, or tourist home you might say, called Morning Side, up in
                    the mountains just outside of Morogoro. It was especially pleasant. I suspect
                    that Morogoro has become a popular place for people to visit now, as it is on
                    the way to one of the game parks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill, you mentioned that there was not a separate Bureau
                        of African Affairs in those days, but you mentioned that there was, however,
                        a Director for Africa. Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I think the first one, when I came out, was John Usher, and his Deputy
                    was Leo Cyr. This was during a period of “Wristonization” or integration of
                    Civil Service and Foreign Service positions. John Usher was Foreign Service, I
                    believe, and Leo Cyr was not. If I remember correctly, Leo Cyr was integrated
                    into the Foreign Service with the same grade, or maybe a higher one, and John
                    was unhappy with this and resigned to take up another position. (He may have
                    left the service even.) In any event, Leo Cyr then became the Acting Director.
                    Later on Fred Hadsel became Director of the Office of African Affairs, and he is
                    the one who came out and visited with Sir Edward Twining to remind him what
                    consular officers did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that Washington was listening to
                        what you were reporting in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, very much so, although undoubtedly it was a very limited number
                    of people. Africa hadn't become quite as important as it did later, but it was
                    beginning to interest people more. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for
                    the Near East and Africa who was especially concerned with African affairs was
                    Joe Palmer, who in later years became Assistant Secretary for African
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>Washington's primary interest in Tanzania, or Tanganyika as it was then, probably
                    arose from the US role in the UN Trusteeship Council, as I mentioned earlier.
                    That probably gave more interest to our reporting than might otherwise have been
                    the case, but I think there was a growing interest that spread from that. The
                    Office of African Affairs was fairly active then, and there was a growing
                    interest in things African, so much so that the Department of State (possibly
                    with some stimulation from Fred Hadsel, I suspect) decided to establish a
                    special program of academic training for Foreign Service Officers in order to
                    develop a corps of Africanists, or people with some African specialization, for
                    future work in Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Just at the end of my tour in Dar es Salaam—I had in fact just received orders
                    assigning me to the Embassy in Switzerland—and on the very day that I went down
                    to ship my air freight off to Bern, I received a telegram reassigning me to
                    African area training. Because I had just shipped my stuff and because I wasn't
                    at all certain that I wanted to devote the rest of my career just to Africa, I
                    sent a cable back to Washington requesting them to cancel the university
                    training assignment and reinstate the assignment to Bern, which they did. After
                    a couple of years in Bern, however, I was interested in getting back into an
                    area where there was a lot more political excitement than I found in Switzerland
                    (although that was indeed an interesting assignment), so I applied for African
                    area training and was sent to Northwestern University in 1957.</p>
                <p>After a year at Northwestern, some three years after I left Dar-es-Salaam, the
                    Department, through the Foreign Service Institute organized the first FSI Africa
                    seminar, in which I was selected to participate. This was a group of twenty
                    young officers who had been working on Africa, led by Fred Hadsel incidentally,
                    which traveled around on a three month tour of Africa, visiting quite a number
                    of the territories and some of the newly independent countries. We spent three
                    weeks in Ghana, including two weeks at the University of Ghana in Legon near
                    Accra; three weeks at Makerere University College in Kampala, Uganda; a week
                    each in Nairobi, Kenya and Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia; about ten days in
                    Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia; and a week in South Africa. There were shorter
                    stops on the way out and back in places like Lagos in Nigeria, Bangui in French
                    Equatorial Africa, Leopoldville and Stanleyville in the Congo, Mbabane in
                    Swaziland, Lourenco Marques in Mozambique, Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, and Dakar
                    in Senegal—not to mention some interesting refueling stops in places like Tabora
                    in Tanganyika, Douala in the Cameroon, and others.</p>
                <p>It was a long, tiring, but interesting tour that gave us all a good, thorough
                    introduction to Africa. I think several of the group had done some academic work
                    on African affairs, so it was a good beginning as we approached the year of
                    Africa in 1960, when so many new states became independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Bill, thank you very much. I can't begin to express
                        my appreciation for all your patience and cooperation, your candor. For the
                        record, I might say that Ambassador Edmondson earned his distinguished title
                        by being Ambassador to South Africa at a much later date, and earlier than
                        that served in Ghana, both of which are likely to be subjects of a future
                        interview. Again, may I express my great appreciation to you for being very
                        cooperative and for your extraordinary memory. Thank you again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Thank you a lot, Art, and good luck to the editor.</p>

                <p>One significant Zambia-related item that was not covered during the foregoing
                    interview was the assistance provided by the US Government through the African
                    American Institute (AAI) for the building of a secondary school for African
                    political refugees from Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. The Agency for
                    International Development (AID) provided funds for the school—both its
                    construction and its initial operations—by contract payments (or annual contract
                    grants, I'm not sure of the exact format) to AAI, which worked directly with the
                    Zambian Government. The project was never described or publicized in Zambia as a
                    US government aid project, apparently because President Kaunda and the Zambian
                    Government regarded that as too sensitive. Nonetheless, Ambassador Good made
                    frequent reference to the AAI - built school as an example of support and
                    assistance provided for the refugees of southern Africa “by the American
                    people.”The school, named Nkumbi International College, was located just about a
                    mile off the “Great North Road,” at a distance of maybe twenty miles or more
                    northeast of the point (just north of Kapiri Mposhi) where the Great North Road
                    turned off from the Lusaka-Ndola road. Construction began before I arrived in
                    Zambia and was completed during my first year or so. Temple Cole and I, together
                    with our wives, visited it once after it had opened, and I was impressed at how
                    much had been done and how difficult it must have been, in such an isolated
                    location.</p>
                <p>The isolation was deliberate, because the Zambian Government did not want the
                    refugee students to be located near Lusaka or any of the other Zambian
                    population centers, reportedly because they did not want the refugees
                    influencing or interfering in Zambian politics. Some local Zambian students were
                    also admitted to the school, and as their proportion grew, efforts were made to
                    get the Zambian Government to assume direct responsibility for administering the
                    school, which I believe they eventually did.</p>
                <p>It would be interesting to know what happened to most of the early southern
                    African refugee students at the school and how history will ultimately judge the
                    value of this unique educational endeavor. The school was intended among other
                    things to serve as a feeder—or at least to help in the academic preparation—of
                    candidates for the Southern African Scholarship Program (SASP), which was funded
                    by the US Government and administered by AAI to provide opportunities for
                    qualified southern African refugees to obtain university training in the United
                    States.</p>

                        Training Foreign Affairs Oral History Program.Bill, you came back from
                        Africa in 1969 and were assigned to the National War College, which is a
                        prestige assignment for any Foreign Service Officer. After that year, you
                        were assigned to the Department, to the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, and more
                        specifically, to the African Region of that Bureau. Was this an assignment
                        you had asked for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: It was one of the assignments that was available. I had thought of the
                    possibility of going into another bureau, but it was one of the fairly few
                    things that seemed to be open at the moment, and it was an area I was interested
                    in, so I took it quite readily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had, I believe, John Richardson as your director at
                        that time. Did he or did the Administration show much interest in cultural
                        exchanges with African countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh, indeed. John Richardson was a very enthusiastic Assistant
                    Secretary. He did want to make a number of changes, because very frequently he
                    wanted to do something, and one of the people who had been there for a long
                    time, one of the Civil Servants, would say, “Well, you can't do it that way,”
                    or, “We tried this once before and it didn't work.” So he was instrumental, I
                    think, in bringing in more Foreign Service Officers as directors and deputy
                    directors in positions in CU, because they tended to be, in fact, more flexible.
                    They often had — some of them were USIA officers — experience in the field or
                    the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the extent of our cultural relations with the
                        White-dominated countries of Africa at that time, such as South Africa and
                        Rhodesia? And also with those that were still colonials, like Angola and
                        Mozambique?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: It was, I would have to say, almost minimal, with the exception of
                    South Africa. There was a limitation, because they didn't feel they could find
                    enough Black candidates — they had had some — and there was criticism of having
                    too many White candidates from South Africa in particular. We had no program at
                    all with Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, because of the UDI, but I can't really recall
                    that we had much with either Mozambique or Angola. We had a few programs from
                    there, but it was primarily Mozambique.</p>
                <p>In South Africa, one of the things that I did when I became Director of the
                    Office of African Programs was to promise them that we could provide more
                    funding if, indeed, they made a greater effort to get Black candidates,
                    “Non-Whites,” as they were called, but that's somewhat pejorative, and we soon
                    abandoned the use of that term.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>One post came back and said they had scraped the bottom of the barrel, but I
                    increasingly felt that this was not the case, that there obviously were people
                    out there who would work fine. The posts began to get some very, very good
                    candidates from the Black, Colored, and Indian communities, as well as a few
                    Whites. But we clearly changed the percentage, so that nearly three-quarters of
                    the candidates from South Africa were Black. That, among others, included the
                    present “Colored” (in South African terms) South African Ambassador to the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of our cultural work in Africa was defensive;
                        that is, blocking the Soviets and the other Communist countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I would say very little. I think the major emphasis was on the
                    objectives of the Fulbright Act, the educational/cultural exchange act, which
                    was primarily to improve the knowledge of people overseas of the United States
                    and also to improve Americans' knowledge of countries abroad. So we looked at it
                    in a very broad, long-term sense, particularly in the Department of State. We
                    avoided its being political or its being linked closely to any immediate foreign
                    policy objectives. We looked at it as developing understanding of the United
                    States, friendlier relationships with other countries, and not in support of
                    specific short-term policy or tactical objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French resent our cultural efforts in their former
                        colonies, or did other former colonial powers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: In the earlier years they perhaps did — I think the French were
                    perhaps more sensitive to English-speaking classes and that sort of thing — but
                    not in any serious way. For the most part, since cultural exchange also
                    contributed to development objectives, it was generally encouraged. You have to
                    remember that this was after the wave of independence, so that we were dealing
                    more and more, outside of southern Africa, with independent African states.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you receive cooperation from African-American
                        organizations like the NAACP or CORE in the work you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, indirectly. We did work with a number of organizations
                    interested in Africa. There were a number of Black Americans —
                    African-Americans, we now say — who were involved and enthusiastic. We had the
                    African American Institute. We had the Phelps-Stokes Fund. The NAACP and others
                    had their own broader agendas, but they generally, indeed, supported the idea of
                    exchange with Africa. They found it of great interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel they were pressuring you in any way to do
                        certain things that they wanted done, or was it more of a feel of
                        cooperation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No, I would say it was all in the feel of cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that African-Americans suffered from an
                        estrangement from native Africans in carrying out our cultural message; that
                        is, could we send Blacks to carry our cultural message into Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Indeed, we did. We had a number of Black officers, both in the
                    Embassies and USIA, and had had for quite a number of years. I had specialized
                    in African Area Studies at Northwestern during a year of training from the
                    Department, and therefore I was particularly sensitive to the attitudes of
                    African-Americans, and indeed among some in an earlier time, there was a
                    sensitivity almost that they wanted to have nothing to do with Africa. Now that
                    has changed radically; it's almost the opposite now. There were people still in
                    that phase, perhaps, but they were going through the change, and there was,
                    largely, I think, because of the explosion of independence in Africa, this
                    growing interest among African-Americans, as well as all other Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have cultural programs with the more repressive
                        regimes...? I'm thinking of someone like Idi Amin in Uganda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: We certainly had programs that preceded him, and these tended to
                    continue. I think we had difficulties, but Idi Amin was not one we had to deal
                    with on the cultural programs. As far as having relationships with repressive
                    regimes, you have to remember that this is not an AID program to other countries
                    or governments: it is an exchange program. We did everything possible to have
                    direct relationships with academic institutions, with potential leaders, and so
                    on, so we had equal programs with those regimes as well as others, or with the
                    countries in which those regimes held sway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to balance cultural exchanges, that is,
                        between tribes or ethnic groups, say in Rwanda, Burundi, Nigeria, Kenya, and
                        places like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I think in our political relationships with countries where those were
                    important, we always had to be sensitive to them, but as far as I can recall we
                    didn't have any problem of balancing. We did try to get equal or appropriate
                    distribution representation, but I don't think we had to think of it in terms of
                    balancing. We were looking for people who would be influential in their own
                    communities and, over time, at the national level.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you invited to speak by Black organizations and
                        colleges in this country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: When I was here, yes, but I didn't do a lot of speaking in that area,
                    because my job was essentially a management job, supervising the program
                    throughout Africa. I spoke much later in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After four years in the cultural field, and it certainly
                        gave you a wide overview of things African, you went to South Africa as the
                        DCM. I believe you had two ambassadors in that period, John Hurd and Bill
                        Bowdler. Did you and the ambassador divide your duties? Did he give you
                        certain fields he wanted you to follow? Or did you work as a tandem team
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Essentially I worked as an alter ego, which meant that I covered all
                    areas, though some, of course, I would watch much more closely than others,
                    because of the issues of the moment.</p>
                <p>I should add, with regard to going to South Africa, that since my experience had
                    been in Black Africa, and my training in African Area Affairs, I had once felt
                    that I would never want to serve in South Africa. I really didn't have any
                    interest at all. In fact, the experience that I had in educational and cultural
                    affairs, and in trying to improve particularly our programs in southern Africa,
                    created much greater interest on my part in the issues there, and a better
                    understanding of them. As I met many more Black South Africans I thought that it
                    would probably be a very interesting place. When I started looking for an
                    assignment toward the end of my period in CU, South Africa was high on the
                    list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political climate when you arrived in South
                        Africa in 1974, and what was the attitude towards the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: In a sense, there was a great deal of hostility, particularly among
                    Afrikaners, and on the part of the National Party Government. They liked to
                    think of the United States as an ally, they liked to think of themselves as part
                    of the West, and they constantly emphasized that and emphasized the role they
                    had played in World War II, despite the fact that the leadership of the National
                    Party had essentially been against South African participation, and some of them
                    had been outright pro-Nazi. So there was that attitude.</p>
                <p>They knew very well that the United States Government — and we constantly
                    emphasized — the people and the Congress of the United States were not in
                    agreement with the policy of apartheid. There was an earlier time when I think
                    that we had been much more conservative in our approach — doing in Rome as the
                    Romans do — but by this time we already had a much firmer policy against South
                    African apartheid.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about an era of, say, twenty years ago.
                        Could the Embassy at that time foresee the coming changes, the changes that
                        have now taken place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Changes were obvious. They were constantly going on. To say that we
                    could have foreseen what has taken place in that way, probably not. But our hope
                    was that indeed there could be changes toward that end. In the long term, with
                    lots of problems in between, that hope has been realized. But at that time there
                    was already some movement away from some of the aspects of the apartheid that
                    had been brought in by the National Party, after 1948, and particularly after
                    1950 (but one needs to go into the history of that to understand it). But there
                    was some slight relaxation here and there that we might discuss in further
                    detail later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were our relations with the South African Government
                        at that time? Would you say they were warm? Correct? Cool?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I would say they were correct... that in some regards we had a degree
                    of cooperation. We had a missile tracking station there for some of the space
                    activity. But that was a minor thing that involved only a couple of people,
                    actually under contract, a civilian agency. And unlike some of the propaganda
                    against it at the time, this was not an element of military cooperation, or
                    anything like it. Although the South Africans, I think, would have liked to have
                    seen more cooperation in that sense. Already we had cut off any kind of naval
                    visits or relationships of that sort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the Embassy's relations with
                        the Black and Colored leaders and their organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: We made a conscious effort to cultivate those leaders, particularly on
                    the part of the substantive officers. We got out into the townships. We
                    certainly dealt with all levels of representation in the White Parliament,
                    including not only the National Party, but also, very obviously, the parties
                    that were in opposition and the Progressive Party, the Progressive Reform Party,
                    later, as it developed. But among Blacks, we were eager to make the acquaintance
                    of different types of leaders, in the labor movement, in different student
                    movements, and so on. That was a very important part of our effort to understand
                    what they hoped for the future of their country and what they were trying to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could, and did, the ambassador entertain Blacks and
                        Coloreds in the Residence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh, yes. This had started much earlier. It started originally with
                    invitations — and I can't tell you now which ambassador did begin it, but it
                    went back a long time — where we held a Fourth of July reception and invited
                    prominent Blacks. That increased constantly in number, and extended in time,
                    before I came, to other types of representation. I made it a policy, as DCM,
                    with support from Ambassador Hurd, to encourage officers, always, to try to have
                    mixed functions, and to include more Africans, Coloreds, etc., in our
                    representational efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the effect on the Embassy of the campaign to get
                        United States companies and institutions to withdraw their funds from South
                        Africa and to dissolve their ties there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: One has to look at this over a period of time, because it did occur
                    over quite a long period of time. There was a great deal of criticism of the
                    fact that the US did have investments in South Africa, and many people wanted
                    pressure to withdraw those investments. But the pressures didn't become very,
                    very strong until a much later period.</p>
                <p>The US Government took a neutral policy on investments. That is, we neither
                    discouraged nor encouraged investment. We tried to explain to potential
                    investors the kinds of problems that they would face from possible protests or
                    from internal problems within the country, and that above all, if they should
                    come in, they should pursue policies that would advance the interests of black
                    workers, that they would help with the housing, and that sort of thing. We
                    particularly encouraged support of the Sullivan principles and had developed a
                    lesser code that was not mandatory, but that we put forward as guidelines for
                    business to consider if they were coming into South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the introduction of Black FSOs at the Embassy prove to
                        be a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No. I was very strongly in favor of that. The first Black FSO had been
                    assigned before I came, and had left before I arrived. Ambassador Hurd, I think,
                    had some problems of his own: he was a little uncertain of this and wasn't
                    particularly eager to get additional [Black] officers at that time. But we did
                    get those, particularly under Ambassador Bowdler, who enthusiastically supported
                    a policy that I and the political section suggested, that we needed to have
                    Black representation in our different agencies throughout. So ultimately we had
                    Blacks in the consular section, the political section, and USIA.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh, there was grumbling... but I think the Department of Foreign
                    Affairs understood our approach. In fact, I would suggest that the Department of
                    Foreign Affairs was somewhat more liberal than many of the other branches of
                    government, with a few exceptions here and there. We made it clear we were going
                    to assign such personnel. We expected no difference in treatment to any of them,
                    and I think that by and large we had support there.</p>
                <p>There were some specific incidences... In one case I remember an officer had been
                    out on an outing, and actually taken some Embassy children out, and had some car
                    problems. He was given a very cold treatment at a hotel when he tried to have
                    the children stay there and have some refreshments. I protested that. The
                    Director General of the Department of Foreign Affairs accepted that protest, and
                    we understand that there were some pretty firm actions taken with the hotel
                    management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get any credit for helping prevent South Africa's

                <p>EDMONDSON: I'm not sure that we did. I can't recall that by the time we were
                    involved in other issues, that it was really an important thing for us.</p>

                        you came back to the Department and became a Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                        African Affairs. I believe you worked under Bill Shopela and Dick Moose in
                        those years of '76 to '78. How many Deputy Assistant Secretaries for African
                        Affairs were there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: When I first came back there were four, and I was named as the third
                    deputy. I had actually been on a three-year tour in South Africa. It was
                    shortened to two and I was brought back, at first to work on very general
                    things, including public relations, Congressional relations... but increasingly,
                    because I had been in South Africa, because Kissinger had that Spring, the
                    Spring of 1976, “discovered Africa” according to many, and there's some truth to
                    that, there was a greater activity on the part of the Secretary and the
                    leadership of the Department to try to move things along in South Africa, and
                    particularly on the issues of Rhodesia and Namibia. Therefore I increasingly got
                    drawn into that and played quite a role as far as the southern African problems
                    were concerned.</p>

                        that time, such as Angola, you mentioned Namibia... Portuguese Colonialism
                        being a big issue at the time, and Rhodesia, and then the Soweto riots also,
                        I gather...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, the Soweto riots occurred while I was in South Africa; in fact,
                    had been going on for a while just about the time that I was called back to work
                    in the Bureau. The riots had pretty well subsided, but the issues that lay
                    behind them were things that we had been pointing out to the South Africans for
                    some time as problems of apartheid. So, yes, internal affairs in South Africa
                    were a concern; however, if you put it in terms of the Secretary's priorities, I
                    would have said Rhodesia came first. There had been earlier concern about Angola
                    and Mozambique, particularly when it looked like South Africa might — and did
                    for a while — move some troops over toward Angola. That quieted, so Rhodesia and
                    Namibia were the first two issues, and there was always concern about the
                    problems in Angola.</p>
                <p>Angola was a sore spot at an earlier time, because the invasion of the South
                    Africans into southern Angola complicated matters no end. In fact, with regard
                    to that particular issue, the role of South Africa I think changed things for
                    the worse, because when Communist influence [began], the Russians and the Cubans
                    (even before the Cubans, the Russians were involved), countries like Ghana and
                    Nigeria were clearly opposed to this Communist effort in Angola, but when South
                    Africa came in, they simply flip-flopped. Any Africanist could have predicted
                    that would have been the effect. I think there was a division within political
                    circles in the United States. Actually, with the wisdom of hindsight, we should
                    have protested much more strongly and more directly the South African incursion
                    into Angola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that connection, were our relations with the South
                        African Government such that our military attach�s or our political officers
                        at the Embassy had foreknowledge that the South Africans were going to move
                        into Angola?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I don't recall that we had foreknowledge. We did have intelligence
                    with regard to their being there very, very soon... I just don't recall. There
                    were accusations that the United States had actually encouraged South Africa to
                    go into Angola, and subsequently, Pieter Botha, who was at that time Minister of
                    Defense, accused the United States of “leaving South Africa in the lurch,” the
                    argument being, from his point of view, that the US had encouraged them to go
                    in. I have no knowledge of any such encouragement being given, overtly or
                    covertly.</p>
                <p>In fact, the only thing I would say is the absence of very strong protest on our
                    part could have been perhaps misinterpreted as encouragement. Subsequently I
                    was, as charg� at one period, authorized to deliver to the Foreign Ministry and
                    to press sources a clear denial of any official encouragement to the South
                    Africans to interfere in the Angolan situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While Secretary Kissinger had talked about formulating a
                        comprehensive United States policy towards Africa, did we ever do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, there was an overall policy; a great deal of emphasis, however,
                    was placed on southern Africa, because of its importance throughout the
                    continent. I think one of the elements of Kissinger's “discovery,” if we can use
                    that phrase, was a realization that Communist influence would grow, unless
                    action were taken to try to solve the problems of Rhodesia, Namibia, and indeed,
                    South Africa itself. The Secretary did make an effort to work on several of
                    those issues. Rhodesia, however, was prominent, foremost. And his efforts on
                    Namibia were less successful. South Africa, he felt, probably should be left a
                    little bit on the back burner. He didn't feel that we should accept what he
                    called “institutionalized racism,” but he didn't feel we should get too deeply
                    involved while we were trying to solve the issues in Rhodesia and Namibia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe it was during this period that Secretary
                        Kissinger met with South African Prime Minister Vorster. Did that result in

                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I don't recall a particular meeting (I should add that I haven't made
                    the preparation I would have like to have made for the interview). I wonder if
                    you are referring to what happened after the Carter Administration?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, This was a meeting I believe they held in Geneva
                        sometime in the summer of '76.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I think that may have had to do with the efforts to bring about a
                    solution in Rhodesia, following Kissinger's travels, his “shuttle diplomacy,”
                    between Dar es Salaam and Lusaka, where he spoke both to Nyerere and Kaunda.
                    Eventually that did lead to a statement by Smith that backed away from his “Not
                    in a thousand years” earlier position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were Deputy Assistant Secretary when the
                        Administration changed in '76/'77. How did Africa as a subject rate in the
                        incoming Carter Administration? Do you think they were looking forward to
                        giving close attention to it? And did Secretary Vance himself give it much
                        attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes. Before I mention that, I would just say that Kissinger did give
                    Africa a lot of attention in the time that I was there. I arrived back in August
                    or September of '76, and when I became involved, it was because he was holding
                    daily meetings, unless they were interrupted by some other State event, on
                    Africa, at which he usually had the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, his
                    Deputy Secretary, an Under Secretary for Political Affairs, the Under Secretary
                    for Economic Affairs, the Chief of the Policy Planning Council, and usually, one
                    of the deputies from the Bureau. As I took over the southern African set of
                    issues, I usually accompanied Ambassador Schaufele, or whoever was acting as
                    Assistant Secretary, to those meetings. We met every day with Kissinger on
                    African issues, primarily the southern African issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>When the new Administration came in, Schaufele was asked to stay on for a period,
                    though subsequently Dick Moose, who had been Under Secretary for Management
                    briefly, was transferred to Africa. At that time I moved up to the position of
                    second of the Deputies, the only holdover from the previous Administration. As
                    an FSO and fairly nonpartisan, nonpolitical, it was an interesting experience,
                    because some of the newcomers looked at anybody who had been held over with a
                    considerable amount of suspicion. One had to prove one's credentials as being
                    seriously engaged in trying to do the best things for the United States.</p>
                <p>But, indeed, the Carter Administration put much heavier emphasis on certain
                    aspects of the African situation. They moved Namibia up to have equal place with
                    Rhodesia on the front of the burner, and they also, I think, moved South Africa
                    up, so that it was no longer quite on the back burner that Kissinger would have
                    had it on. There clearly was strong emphasis on trying to come up with policies
                    that would do more to further solution of these issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can read that to mean that they put more attention on

                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No. I don't think so at all. In fact the US was often criticized for a
                    certain amount of deference to the French and former French areas, the
                    Francophone African countries. I think that was only natural, because those
                    countries themselves had become associated with the EEC, and had continued to
                    have a good deal of French assistance and a lot of French troops there. While we
                    took a strong interest and played a role, I think that we didn't particularly
                    disturb the French. There may have been small issues here and there, but I would
                    have said essentially that they did play an important role.</p>

                        far as you were concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Basically, he was asked to take on the task of meeting with Vorster in
                    Vienna and underwent quite a number of briefings in which the Director of the
                    Office of Southern African Affairs and I and others participated... preparation
                    in particular to say what President Carter wanted him to say to Vorster in
                    Vienna, to explain that we were taking now a harder position on apartheid, and
                    we wanted them to take some steps forward. I think we were trying to say that
                    they needed to make progress away from apartheid and toward full political
                    participation. We weren't providing any particular formulas, because that's up
                    to the people of the country itself to do. The South Africans chose to interpret
                    that more strongly.</p>
                <p>The press after the conference in Vienna asked Vice President Mondale about what
                    he'd said, and one of the questions was, “Well, does that mean majority rule, or
                    one man, one vote?” The Vice President said, “Yes.” It's obviously more
                    complicated than that. You can argue, with our Senate and House of
                    Representatives, we don't technically have one man, one vote, or one person, one
                    vote, that it's a very complicated mechanism that does provide a democratic
                    atmosphere. However, the press reaction to that I think made Mondale pull back
                    somewhat. He had been very eager to do exactly what President Carter had wanted,
                    went over it very carefully. The press blew this up.</p>
                <p>The other part of it was that Vorster went back to South Africa — an election was
                    pending, the campaign was on — and used that as a tool to try to increase his
                    majority in the election. In effect he fought against the United States rather
                    than against any opposition in South Africa.</p>
                <p>After that, Mondale was occupied with other matters, not with southern Africa in
                    particular.</p>

                <p>EDMONDSON: We never knew for sure. We had suspicions that they were. They clearly
                    had a nuclear program. Earlier we had had a degree of cooperation with them that
                    we trying to use as leverage to try to get them to join the Nonproliferation
                    Treaty. We could understand from their point of view, that they saw the
                    possibility of enriching uranium and exporting it as a commercial advantage that
                    they wanted to pursue. But at the same time, their degree of secrecy, their
                    refusal to join the Nonproliferation Agreement, gave us a great deal of concern.
                    So we watched it very closely, and we had several high-level visitors come out
                    to negotiate with them and try to persuade them to join the Nonproliferation
                    Agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work on the British-American plan for the
                        transition in Rhodesia? Did you get involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, involved, yes. There were, as you know, several stages, and
                    eventually we assigned our Ambassador to Zambia, Steve Low, who is now President
                    of the Association of Diplomatic Studies and Training, as a liaison with the
                    British in their negotiations. We supported that by keeping the South Africans
                    informed, trying to win South African cooperation.</p>
                <p>In fact, if you go back to the Kissinger period, Kissinger felt that there was no
                    way we were going to get a solution in South Africa without pressure on Rhodesia
                    from South Africa. I think, indeed, the South Africans saw it — at least the
                    South African Government — as in their interest to see come kind of settlement,
                    because the continuation of the war in Rhodesia could only create more problems
                    over the long run for South Africa. So, indeed, it was possible to get some
                    cooperation. It was limited. It was at times cranky. But it was an important
                    element. So we continued to want to keep the South Africans involved and
                    supportive with the idea of getting a solution in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>Steve Low would often come through... occasionally we'd have him brief somebody,
                    or we'd obtain the information... some of it was simply a matter of
                    transportation into and out of Rhodesia when the British were going back and
                    forth as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finally, in that period, did you find that National
                        Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski involved himself in African
                        matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh yes, yes. Not to the exclusion of other things, but certainly he
                    was interested in it. Tony Lake, who is currently in that position, was the head
                    of the Policy Planning Council in the Department of State, and he played a very,
                    very important role as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1978, then, the President nominated you to be
                        Ambassador to South Africa, a worthy promotion. Did you have a difficult
                        confirmation process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No, I did not. I was probably assisted by the fact that the day
                    before, maybe even the morning that I went up, the news had come that the South
                    Africans had accepted an agreement, proposed through a resolution in the
                    Security Council, on Namibia. So there was a fairly good feeling that we might
                    be on the road toward some solution there. I was fortunate — I was, by the way,
                    not expecting to get South Africa — I had heard rumors of another possible post,
                    so it was somewhat to my surprise that I was actually returned to South
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>Before confirmation, but [after] the nomination had been made, I accompanied
                    Secretary Vance on a trip primarily to Rhodesia. We went to Dar es Salaam, and
                    then to South Africa, and then to Rhodesia itself, for the first time in a long
                    time, to talk with Smith and his people. It was then that the announcement of my
                    appointment came out, so when I arrived in Pretoria, people knew that I was to
                    replace Bill Bowdler. Bill Bowdler was getting ready to leave already.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I might confide a feeling that I had at the time... though I certainly had been
                    interested, because it was an important post... We had arrived and had
                    discussions with the Foreign Minister Pieter Botha. He had invited the
                    delegation out to dinner and further discussions at his house. I left a little
                    early in an Embassy car to get back and send off a cable on some of our
                    conversations. I was alone in the car riding back to the Embassy, and suddenly a
                    great feeling of depression came over me, that I was coming back to this
                    country, facing all the problems of apartheid, the issues and so on, and for a
                    moment I wondered, Did I really want to do this? Of course, later, when I
                    arrived, the adrenalin ran again, the issues are difficult but fascinating and
                    important. But that was the atmosphere when I went out.</p>
                <p>You asked about the confirmation hearings... I was lucky in that I had been
                    following it so closely, so there weren't many questions they could ask that I
                    didn't have reasonably good, logical answers for. I was really quite well
                    informed. I had the whole committee, and it was over in the Capitol, rather than
                    in the Senate Offices Building, so the beige-covered tables were down on the
                    same level. I sat right next to the note-taker, and at the same level... it's
                    not quite what you often see, where the witness is sitting way below the group
                    of judges. It was very collegial. I remember one of the senators reading a
                    telegram sent by an acquaintance of mine, with whom I had worked many years
                    earlier in CU, endorsing my nomination. It really went quite well. It was a long
                    session, about an hour, but there, again, the adrenalin ran and I enjoyed
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I ask, was Senator Helms then on the Committee? Did he
                        give you any difficult questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Senator Helms was not on the Committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand your feeling of momentary depression at the
                        thought of going [to South Africa], but I think you'll admit it was one of
                        the half-dozen Embassies we had at the time that were in the spotlight, in
                        which there would be great attention focused, not only from our Government,
                        but also from institutions and people in the country. Did President Carter
                        give you any special message to take when you presented yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No, not at that time. I subsequently carried messages out for him.
                    Essentially it was a policy that was pretty well established and set. In paying
                    courtesy calls, of course there is the usual exchange where you present
                    credentials; these are usually pro forma remarks on both sides. I made clear
                    that my position was to represent the United States to all the people of South
                    Africa, somewhat pointedly. But it was an easy sort of occasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to a question we discussed earlier, was your
                        mission there affected by the demands on our companies and institutions to
                        withdraw their investments. Did you feel that was hindering you in any
                        way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No, it wasn't hindering. In fact, I think it was illustrative of the
                    pressures in the United States. It was easier, when we were taking our position
                    with the Department of Foreign Affairs or other South African officials, to say,
                    “Look, we're expressing the views of the American people, views that are also
                    being expressed in Congress.” I think they understood better our neutral
                    position on investment, for example. I declined, as had my predecessor, the
                    position of Honorary President of the American Chamber of Commerce, because we
                    didn't want to be too closely associated. We did cooperate, and I would meet
                    with them, and spoke to them on occasion, and we tried to be helpful to the
                    businessmen who were there. But we tried particularly to encourage the
                    activities that the majority of them were carrying on to improve their community
                    service. That is, the idea of service, which they often practice here.</p>
                <p>One of the issues that concerned the South African Government and some of the
                    businesses was that the Carter Administration had applied a number of new
                    restrictions, you could even call them sanctions, if you wish, but they were
                    limitations on exports, and an absolute prohibition of exports to the South
                    African military or police or any of the South African Government institutions
                    involved in the enforcement of apartheid law. That led to some difficult
                    problems. For instance, if the police department, and police were included with
                    military, wanted to put in some new traffic lights in a city, technically those
                    came under these regulations and there would have been a prohibition. This kind
                    of issue would come up. What were called the “grey areas” issues were constantly
                    debated, and there were other problems of that sort.</p>
                <p>We also in the Embassy concentrated on reports of things that might be in
                    violation of such regulations. For instance, we were very concerned at one point
                    over the possible export of heavy duty tractor engines that might conceivably
                    have been used to put into armored vehicles or tanks, even. Those would have
                    fallen under the restrictions. This sort of thing was a matter of constant work,
                    but not a matter of controversy, necessarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pieter Botha had become Prime Minister by this time. What
                        were your relations with him? Were you able to meet with him... freely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: He became Prime Minister soon afterward, but when I first arrived,
                    Vorster was still Prime Minister and then later became Executive President.
                    Vorster and I had a very good, long conversation, which I reported in detail to
                    Washington. My first conversation with Botha was when he was Minister of Defense
                    and he was still off on his kick about how the US had left them in the lurch in
                    Angola, and he was very bitter about the application of military sanctions and
                    embargo on military equipment. The US had had one for many, many years, but we
                    had pushed very strongly in the UN for a UN resolution on this.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>When I made my courtesy call on him, unlike all the other ministers — and South
                    Africans by their nature tend to be personally courteous and outgoing and fairly
                    friendly; most of them would come out from behind their desks and greet you,
                    you'd sit down at a table and have some tea or something like that — Botha came
                    out, took my hand, and went back behind his desk. So I sat on the front side, he
                    on the back side of his desk, and he proceeded to lash out against US policy. I
                    found myself getting more and more angry, the red creeping up the back of my
                    neck, but trying to stay diplomatic. I had the feeling I was responding just as
                    firmly, almost pounding my side of his desk, as he was his. It wasn't a very
                    good substantive conversation. As I try to recall, there wasn't much reportable,
                    except the attitude of Botha himself. He was very, very, very bitter about the
                    United States and about our policy.</p>
                <p>Subsequently I did have dealings with him on occasion. I recall, once I was in
                    Pretoria and we had information of [South Africans] being active again in Angola
                    and frankly wanted to warn them of the fact that we knew through intelligence
                    sources what they were doing. I don't know what those sources were, and
                    obviously couldn't mention them, but I suspect that they might have been from
                    air surveillance and that sort of thing. I flew down from Pretoria. He hadn't
                    moved up to Pretoria from Cape Town.</p>
                <p>As you probably know, there are two capitals, really: the administrative capital,
                    the regular capital people think of, is Pretoria, but the legislative capital
                    where Parliament meets, is Cape Town. During the meetings of Parliament, the
                    Cabinet and all the senior officers of the government and various departments
                    would have been in Cape Town. Then there was usually a little period in between
                    when they moved back and forth. [Botha] had just been named Prime Minister and
                    he was still living in the house where he had been as Minister of Defense.</p>
                <p>I went down and by the time I had arrived — of course we had shared some of our
                    information with some of our allies, particularly the group of five who worked
                    on Namibia, the “Contact Group” as we called it — the ambassadors of those
                    countries had received instructions, while I was flying down, to associate
                    themselves, or to authorize me to say that they associated themselves, with the
                    protest that I was making. One of the officers of the Embassy in Pretoria
                    alerted the Consul General in Cape Town, so when he met me I had his assurance
                    that I could speak on behalf of the Contact Group and not just the United
                    States, which made more of an impression.</p>
                <p>To my surprise, Botha took it very well, I think probably very seriously. He was
                    really quite friendly and very courteous, and after the session —it was about
                    11:30, it was getting toward lunchtime — he introduced me to his daughter, who
                    had come in before lunch, and he asked me to stay for lunch, which I thought was
                    very nice. I declined, because I had a business lunch. But he could be charming.
                    On the other hand, I found Botha a very, very difficult man on other occasions
                    that I had to meet him. Some of those may come up later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to meet with or entertain the anti-apartheid
                        leaders who were not in jail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes. Definitely. Frankly, some of the more junior people, or people
                    who were more activist, would really prefer to come to the homes of more junior
                    [American] officers. For instance, one of the political officers who followed
                    Black politics in particular really got some of the more radical Black leaders.
                    But he would invite me, so I had an opportunity to meet them and they to meet me
                    without their feeling they were coming to see the American Ambassador. There
                    were a variety of ways... You have to remember that an Embassy works as a team.
                    I very much encouraged our officers to get out, to see these people, to see them
                    in the townships, keep me informed...</p>
                <p>We even had a policy, which I had enforced earlier as DCM, to make sure we went
                    into the townships freely. Normally Whites or outsiders were supposed to get
                    permission to go into the townships, but we simply went. Often we were tailed.
                    Only once or twice did it look like somebody thought about stopping us or
                    arresting us... no one did. (Journalists would have this problem.) I told them,
                    “We are not going to ask for a permit. We are going to go in and see people.”
                    And we were able to do that.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were many people who were anti-apartheid and very firmly so, and
                    sometimes quite outspoken, who were not necessarily political people primarily.
                    But we certainly invited them, heard their views, and also tried to have, as I
                    mentioned earlier, mixed parties. At dinner parties we tried always to have some
                    Blacks or Coloreds or others — in Cape Town, more often than not they'd be
                    Colored — to our dinner parties, and the only occasions I can recall that would
                    be strictly all-White were for instance, if we met with a segment of a Party
                    that had no Blacks in it. It would be a lunch, say, we might do to get with a
                    Party's leaders who by definition happened to be all White. But on a purely
                    social occasion we really did try to mix as much as possible.</p>

                        at occasions like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: It may have, but none where they ever expressed it. By that time
                    enough changes — we haven't really discussed the change from the earlier period
                    to the later period — had occurred that I think they had gotten used to it. I
                    mentioned our earlier ambassadors had started having Blacks come to the Fourth
                    of July party and others, but the Fourth of July party was particularly
                    important, because in the old days, you would always invite the ministers, and
                    I'm sure in the past Cabinet Ministers came. For a while, the government
                    effectively boycotted those Fourth of July parties. The ministers wouldn't come,
                    and senior civil servants wouldn't come. Gradually it got to the point where
                    we'd get civil servants coming, and finally maybe a minister or two coming, and
                    I entertained and got them to come.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Frequently you would have situations where there might be a businessman, or there
                    might be someone in government somewhere, or there might be someone in the
                    academic area who would come who had their own Black contacts, which was useful,
                    because many of our Black contacts would come from those South Africans, liberal
                    and other, who made a point of keeping up contacts with Blacks. There were very
                    few, indeed, but still of importance to us. We would get others together and
                    have them talk back and forth; sometimes the arguments would be pretty strong.
                    It was always fascinating to see, as they left, how they would say, “Well, we
                    must get together...” It was interesting.</p>
                <p>Some of these people we would invite were in fact not illiberal. They were not
                    necessarily supporters of apartheid, either. They were people, I suppose, like
                    the majority of many of the people in any society or country, who went along.
                    They had odd feelings and misunderstandings, kind of like the South in the old
                    days in our country, where contacts were only with servants, and that sort of
                    thing. They really didn't know what educated Blacks were like. For them it was
                    an education, and I think probably an enlightenment and pleasure — they really
                    probably did enjoy this. For the Blacks, sometimes they felt a bit awkward. But
                    often they were very outspoken: they said what they felt, for instance, some of
                    the Black journalists.</p>
                <p>These kinds of events done at different levels by Embassy staff people I think
                    probably did some good. How big a factor they were is hard to say, but they
                    certainly gave us a better picture of what different attitudes and feelings were
                    like. It could be very surprising to hear some of the things they'd say; you
                    felt you might be having a little bit of influence in certain areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps some of those contacts that were made fifteen
                        years ago are having their result today in what is happening in South
                        Africa. At least one can hope so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When you were ambassador, were you publicly criticized by the South African
                    media?</p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh, yes! Very, very often, and it seemed to be increasingly so, at
                    times. Early in my period there as ambassador, I arrived in Cape Town and
                    presented my credentials there. My first speech was I think to a Rotary group,
                    and I made it off the record. It was fairly quiet. People by word of mouth got
                    an idea of what was being said, which was essentially what our policy had been
                    all along: I explained that we had applied a number of restrictions on exports
                    to military and police, our abhorrence of apartheid, our hope to influence the
                    government to move away from apartheid, toward full political participation.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>But I made a stronger speech fairly early in my period there, in Johannesburg, to
                    the South African Chamber of Commerce. There, again, I didn't initially issue
                    press-release copies of the speech, but the press was there. Some of it was
                    misinterpreted. Among other things, I explained that over the long term,
                    apartheid could lead to increasing difficulties within the country, struggles
                    from opposition. I used, among other things, [the phrase that] consequences
                    could lead to problems like civil war, which really hit a button. I was called
                    in very gently by the Director General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to
                    indicate their unhappiness with the speech. The press had various distorted
                    versions. One of the Afrikaans journalists there, however, was one of my most
                    constant defenders, effectively, because he heard what I said and knew what I
                    didn't say.</p>
                <p>But the Afrikaans press was very eager, often, to show a prejudicial view on the
                    part of the Embassy, and of me particularly. I can remember once going to
                    Soweto, where we made a book presentation to a new Center we had established
                    there, I think it was Sintopticon Week. The book, Marx's Das Kapital, was one of
                    the books that was a prohibited book, so we didn't include it, since this was
                    not, essentially, a local community thing. But I mentioned [the prohibition].
                    Interestingly, there was a Black Rhodesian journalist there who picked it up,
                    and there was a slight difference of interpretation of what I had said. It
                    appeared in the Rhodesian press and then played back, mostly in the Afrikaans
                    press. I have clippings somewhere... I don't remember all the details now, but
                    it distorted the point and made it look like a much more anti-South African
                    speech than it indeed was. So the Afrikaans press really roared up and down on
                    that.</p>
                <p>The later period, after the election when President Reagan came in, a lot of
                    South Africans could barely wait until I was removed as ambassador. They hoped
                    for a much closer alliance with the US Government, which in fact didn't occur
                    (but there can be differences of interpretation of policy, of course.) I was
                    kept on [for months]... I was suggesting that I should be removed, and was
                    hoping to get another assignment. It was not until July when finally, and rather
                    suddenly, they suggested that I come home, which was fine.</p>
                <p>At the Fourth of July party, my wife had arranged that we have something
                    different from the usual cocktails, champagne, and so on. Those were all
                    available, but we made it a noontime kind of picnic-party where we had
                    hamburgers and hotdogs and cokes, and we had some of the servants wearing straw
                    boaters, to make it a somewhat more gala occasion. People liked it and frankly I
                    was impressed that we had a lot of Cabinet ministers there. Because we had
                    advertized that it would be something like this, someone in one of the Afrikaans
                    papers wrote, “We know the American ambassador is on the skids, because he can't
                    afford to have anything but hotdogs...” something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>But they looked for these things. Well, I got to the point where I almost
                    perversely enjoyed it. You get pretty thick skin in any job like this. I knew
                    that I was doing my job right, I knew that not only many friends among the Black
                    communities, but also among South Africans, including Afrikaners, not
                    necessarily liberals, but Ferlisthe Afrikaners realized that we had taken a
                    position, that rarely was it as strong as the Afrikaans made it out to be, and
                    sometimes it was stronger than people elsewhere thought it should be. Yet, I was
                    constantly being harassed, in a sense, but it didn't bother me. I rather even
                    enjoyed it. It showed that from my point of view, I was doing my job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't lacking for publicity, in other words.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No, sir. I remember one of the best speaking occasions I had I was
                    invited to come down on a “Freedom of Speech” day at the University. This was
                    after our airplane incident where we had a couple of our attach�s declared
                    persona non grata. There were big posters: “Ambassador Edmondson Coming!” There
                    were little subtitles talking about spy planes and so on, so there was a good
                    turnout. The students who were there were Black as well as Whites, and the
                    Whites were known often to be rather radical.</p>
                <p>I made a speech that got on television... I left a lot of time for questions, and
                    the questions were hard ones and good ones — sometimes a little hostile. But I
                    felt good about it because I was able to explain American attitudes and policy
                    more fully than I had on almost any other occasion. I felt that the response was
                    good. The questions got more substantive and less polemical as we went along. It
                    was a really good feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that covered in the press at all, your speech there at
                        the University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, it got television coverage. Portions of it. It came out very
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you about that spy plane incident. How did
                        the South Africans get access to our plane? What made them think that our
                        people were spying.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: For many, many years there had been an attach� office in Pretoria, and
                    for many, many years we had a plane. When I first went down as DCM we had what
                    must be promoted as a DC-3, a Z-47. Subsequently we got a C-12, which is a
                    small, more executive jet, very handy for certain things. The attach� office
                    often used flights for, in effect, representational kinds of things, so there
                    were South African military officers who had flown on that plane, and I'm sure
                    they knew that it had a camera in it as well. They made a big thing of it, but
                    they probably knew ahead of time.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I had also used that plane once when I was Deputy Assistant Secretary...
                    Kissinger sent me out on a trip to liaise with the senior British
                    representative, Lanview, who went out on a negotiation trip with regard to
                    Rhodesia. Kissinger didn't want us to be directly associated, didn't want me to
                    fly with them, and I had to fly separately. In the southern Africa area I was
                    able to get the attach� plane to take me to places like Botswana and then over
                    to Maputo and up to Dar es Salaam. The plane was then used when Steve Low was
                    going into Rhodesia, since the commercial connections weren't particularly good.
                    It would pick him up in Lusaka or Pretoria to carry him up there.</p>
                <p>On one occasion the air attach� who piloted the plane did not observe my direct
                    instructions. First of all, I was a little reluctant on that particular trip,
                    because there could have been a commercial connection, but I knew it would have
                    been a lot easier and quicker for Steve. So I agreed to check with Washington to
                    make sure they had no objections, and they agreed that the trip could go on.</p>
                <p>I instructed the pilot not to go across to the military side. They were always
                    very eager to make some contacts among the Rhodesian military and see what they
                    could learn — I sometimes thought they felt they could learn more than they
                    actually could — whereas we had prohibited such contacts, except on a casual
                    basis if they occurred accidentally. I told [the attach�] to park that plane on
                    the civilian side of the airport and to return as soon as he'd refueled. He
                    claimed, at least, that a storm front had come in and they were delayed, and he
                    parked the plane on the military side.</p>
                <p>We later had some information, I don't know the accuracy of it entirely, that the
                    Rhodesians had perhaps put the South Africans up to the idea of looking into the
                    plane. The plane had a locked door, but like one on an automobile you could open
                    it with a screwdriver, I guess.</p>
                <p>It so happened that the attach� was eager to fly over an area where we'd had some
                    flights before and were suspicious with regard to South Africa's nuclear work,
                    but we had other sources that were far better than an airplane of that sort.
                    (Obviously, from space you can see a great deal.) So I prohibited him from
                    flying over that area, or creating further problems when he didn't have to.</p>
                <p>For some reason [the attach�] was picking up our one Ambassador to the Else
                    countries, Ambassador Norland, to go from Botswana over to Swaziland or Lesotho.
                    He had a flight out to the West Coast first, and then he had applied for a
                    clearance to fly from Uppington in the western part of Cape Province to
                    Botswana, which was an unusual route that went over part of the Kalahari Desert,
                    where we already had information of some activity by the South Africans, both
                    from our own sources, and, interestingly, from some Russian sources.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>There was no need for us to fly. And it was pretty well clear that they wouldn't
                    have approved [that flight plan] anyway, so why ask? He asked and it was
                    refused, and he had to go through the usual route of flying out of Johannesburg.
                    As a result, while they were parked in Uppington, having applied to go and been
                    turned down, the plane was broken into, by, presumably, South African
                    authorities, because they got whatever was in the camera: some photographs,
                    which were of normal kinds of things: approaches to airways, and so on, which
                    are often available from other sources. But they made a big deal of it. They
                    decided to declare [persona non grata] the air attach�, the assistant air
                    attach�, who was the copilot, and who often piloted the plane, and the enlisted
                    noncom, who was the flight attendant officer.</p>
                <p>It so happened that they didn't tell me... it happened in this way: I had been
                    back in the United States on consultation. When I arrived back in Johannesburg,
                    I was met briefly by the DCM, who had been charg�, of course, while I was gone.
                    I had a message to deliver to Botha from President Carter, a tough message on
                    apartheid and some other matters. So I took the plane on immediately to Cape
                    Town. The attach� told me that they'd had information that the plane had been
                    broken into, but said it had been reported to Washington. I said, “Fine. I don't
                    want to carry the cable with me on my person tonight. I won't be going into the
                    office tonight right away, but bring it down.” This was on a weekend. I
                    delivered my message to Botha I think that morning. He was very angry, virtually
                    almost threw it down on the coffee table in front of me and ranted and raved a
                    bit.</p>
                <p>It was while the plane was down there that they decided... I was called in by
                    Foreign Minister Botha and told that they were going to declare these people
                    persona non grata, that they were to get out in 24 or 48 hours, I forget what it
                    was, but whatever it was it was unacceptably short, because they had to get back
                    to Pretoria and pack up their equipment and their household effects. Actually I
                    first said, “Let me report this to my government,” which was the normal
                    procedure so we could give them some sort of answer. I didn't have an answer to
                    give them at the moment. I said that I had no knowledge that the plane had been
                    engaged in any illegal or improper activity. The implication was that I would be
                    given time to report and get back to them.</p>
                <p>But I'd hardly returned before it was on the radio and television that Botha came
                    out with the announcement that they were declaring these people persona non
                    grata. We had by that time secure phones, which most [Embassies] now do, so I
                    was able to get back. I learned that yes, they had reported this to Washington,
                    but they had reported only to the Pentagon, not even sent a copy, as I had
                    understood, perhaps incorrectly, that they had done, to the Department of State.
                    The first thing I did was make sure that the Department got a copy of the
                    message, gave them an explanation, sent off cables, etc., and hoped for some
                    instructions. But by this time, obviously, [the South Africans] weren't going to

                <p>We had an assistant naval attach�, a Marine officer and a pilot, who could and
                    occasionally did fly that plane. So I ordered him down to remove the plane, take
                    it out, because I didn't know if they would try to violate diplomatic immunity
                    and get into the plane, or not. He came down, flew it out to Botswana, and their
                    air attach� came down from Kinshasa, picked it up, and flew it on back.</p>
                <p>So we were reduced, and ultimately we pulled out that assistant naval attach�,
                    and we left one officer, because we in turn had, to their surprise, apparently —
                    they seemed very surprised — retaliated by asking them to remove their attach�s
                    from Washington. So that was the short of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this linger on and affect your relations with the
                        South African Government, or was it a one-time ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Well, not really. There were lots of jokes about it. I can show you
                    the cartoon downstairs that I was given when I left that showed me with some
                    planes. (I had once had a pilot's license, so I was always interested in planes,
                    anyway .) Things blew over in that way. They always resented it, but in effect I
                    was not all that pleased to have so many attach�s there anyway; I didn't think
                    that we needed that many. I'm not sure that we got that much information from
                    having them, and there was no reason... We did not, propaganda from other places
                    to the contrary, engage in any kind of military coordination with the South
                    Africans. The very presence of these people simply aided the impression that
                    people had to say that we did.</p>
                <p>I was happy that we were left with the Army attach�, who had had African area
                    training. He'd been in Ghana briefly — when I was political officer there I had
                    once briefed him. We got what I thought was a lot of very good reporting from
                    him, in a matter-of-fact way... he did understand American policies... I thought
                    it was just as well to operate with one attach� with as many as we'd had. I was
                    unhappy with the incident, but I wasn't unhappy to see reductions in the number
                    of attach�s.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was, I believe, about this time that Jesse Jackson made
                        a tour of South Africa. Did you meet with him during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, I went to the airport to meet him. There was a banquet being
                    given for him that I wasn't able to attend because of a competing invitation. I
                    did ask our political counselor to accompany him, to have a meeting with him,
                    and to give him any assistance that we could while he was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did his tour affect US-South African relations? Or did
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: That's hard to say. Over a long period of time it was one of many,
                    many things that adds in to impressions and policies. But I wouldn't have said
                    it had a major impact, by itself. Except — and this is a little bit difficult to
                    describe accurately and not be misinterpreted...:</p>
                <p>African-Americans have a very strong interest nowadays in Africa, a very good,
                    healthy interest. It's good to see [African-American] businessmen, Peace Corps
                    people, and of course by then Embassy people taking part... And
                    [African-American] people visited. (Some couldn't get visas. We tried hard and
                    eventually got some in. Others we couldn't. This goes back a long time.)</p>
                <p>The attitudes of Africans varied. For the most part Africans are very, very
                    interested in Black Americans. They come to [the United States] and they want to
                    see the Black community and they experience some wonderful hospitality. That is
                    also true of Africans: they are eager to have African-Americans come visit their
                    churches and communities and so on. One thing, however, is that they don't like
                    to be preached to by Americans, whether White or Black. Some Black Americans,
                    because of their own experience in the United States, tend to feel, “We can tell
                    them how to do it.” The truth is, we can learn both ways. Of course we Americans
                    now can learn a lot from South Africans of both kinds.</p>
                <p>I think there was a feeling that occasionally visitors from overseas, White and
                    Black, I should say, tend to overlook the differences that exist among different
                    African groups: the different countries, different communities, different races,
                    different tribes, etc. When we tell them that they ought to get together — and
                    this is, essentially, and correctly, a message that Jesse Jackson was trying to
                    deliver: if they want to have an effect in the fight against apartheid, they
                    need to work together — this is not always received the way it is meant. While
                    the effect of Jesse Jackson's visit was good in most respects, there was among a
                    few people a feeling of, “Why is he coming out to tell us what to do?” This is
                    something that all Americans have to be just a little bit careful of.</p>

                        his post as our representative at the UN. Did that have any resonance in
                        South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Not directly, because it was very clearly over the problems of Israel
                    and the Near East. Andy Young was highly respected, and, interestingly, among
                    Whites as well [as Blacks]. He had visited South Africa after being in a
                    conference in Dar es Salaam or Mafuto earlier, and had spoken to a number of
                    businessmen, including Afrikaans-speaking businessmen, and they came away
                    thinking, “Andy Young makes a lot of sense.” It was always interesting to see
                    that he had really achieved some respect among those people. After that, they
                    looked up to him a great deal more in the UN. Of course, his deputy who later
                    succeeded him, Don McHenry, was also very effective. He'd actually been in South
                    Africa a number of times earlier, and as the American most responsible for
                    working with the Contact Group on Namibia, he was well known. He carried on
                    pretty much... so Andy's resignation didn't really influence that too much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Oh yes, very easily, with no problems. Occasionally he came up to
                    ceremonies at the Episcopal Church in Pretoria as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he critical of our policies at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Like many Black South Africans, they all hoped that the US would and
                    could do more, so critical in that sense, yes. But I think he was encouraged
                    about those things we did that they did consider positive: the restrictions on
                    exports to South Africa of certain types, and the fact that we did make an
                    effort to get out to see and show our support for various elements of the Black
                    South African society. He was unhappy after the election with the Reagan
                    Administration. I remember his saying that he would come for a farewell thing
                    for me, but that he wasn't going to be coming to the American Embassy any more
                    after that. That was a symbolic act on his part. I don't think that applies any
                    more: it's past history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a policy on South Africa's Homelands at that
                        time? Did that affect your activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Indirectly, but not much. We refused to recognize the so-called
                    “independence” — nominal independence — of those Homelands of South Africa
                    declared to be independent. Of course, no other country in the world recognized
                    them, either. We pursued perhaps a little bit more vigorous policy than certain
                    other countries in consequence of this, because I didn't want anybody to be seen
                    in any way as doing something that officially recognized those countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>We would not recognize their passports: if they could come, they were South
                    African, they could get a South African passport. In fact, they had worked out
                    some system that they did get South African passports if they wanted to travel
                    abroad. I put restrictions on travel just as we had done to southwest Africa and
                    Namibia to make sure that no one mistook our policy, that we in no way would
                    recognize any aspect of these so-called “independent Homelands.” We did visit
                    Homelands from time to time, and we could go to these Homelands, but if we did
                    so, we didn't do it as an official visit on any of the officials there. We just
                    went in as though it were a part of South Africa, because you weren't
                    stopped.</p>
                <p>With regard to the other Homelands, we regarded them as part of the South African
                    system and we had, of course, a relationship with Chief Buthelezi, sometimes a
                    bit tenuous, but we did go in for those affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you maintain relations with the Congressional Black

                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, but not in a formal sense, but as any other Congressmen. Indeed.
                    Congressman Davis, of course, came out [to Africa?] earlier, and we had
                    difficulty getting him into the country [South Africa?]: it was always a source
                    of friction with the South African Government. Congressman Davis [was] unhappy
                    when we couldn't achieve getting him in, but there was just no way of forcing
                    another country to do our bidding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How useful was the visit that the incoming Assistant

                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: It was useful on his part for him to get a first-hand view, I'm sure,
                    and to explain the policies of the new Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which, I gather, were warmly received by some of the
                        Afrikaners.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, it's a period that historians may continue to want to examine and
                    argue about. “Constructive engagement,” which was his term, in a purely
                    theoretical sense made some sense, as I would argue. I was myself uncomfortable
                    with certain aspects of it which made it appear that we were getting much closer
                    to the South African Government. This needs to be explained a little.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>There were elements in the US, in the Government, who often went to extremes in
                    what they were saying about South Africa. These were usually people who were not
                    in a position to pronounce on US Government policy towards South Africa. I
                    wouldn't cite names now, even if I could recall... but I remember some actually
                    false statements made about what was happening in South Africa, whereas people
                    like Don McHenry were always, always very precise. When Don McHenry spoke about
                    South Africa, he knew whereof he spoke, and he could articulate US Government
                    policy very, very well. But there were people speaking out here, there, and
                    elsewhere in other parts of the Government who went beyond... My feeling was,
                    and this comes from somebody who was criticized for his own speeches
                    occasionally, that it was terribly important to be very accurate and very
                    careful in our expression of policy.</p>
                <p>So one new aspect of the new policy of perhaps speaking a little bit more
                    quietly, being less on a pulpit, I could understand and, to some extent, agree
                    with. As one always does, you adjust to a new policy. But I had a feeling that
                    some people felt that just by being nicer to the South African Government and
                    removing some of the restrictions that the Carter Administration had had — and
                    this caused a great deal of concern elsewhere — these kinds of things made it
                    appear that “constructive engagement” was nothing but a closer relationship with
                    the South African Government.</p>
                <p>I think that ignored the feelings of many of the Black African States, whose
                    assistance, I felt, was very important in things like the earlier negotiations
                    on Rhodesia and then Namibia. It turned out ultimately to be important in
                    Rhodesia that the African Nationalists involved be very pragmatic in the
                    negotiations, say, with Britain; that was a little harder, maybe, with South
                    Africa, but the extreme positions they took didn't always help negotiations.
                    Very frequently, countries like Nigeria and Tanzania would provide advice to
                    organizations like ZAPU and ZANU, SWAPO, ANC, and PAC that would be more
                    moderate, would see how there were tactics and strategies that would be more
                    likely to bring about an agreement towards independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How close was the cooperation between South Africa and
                        Israel? Did we have any evidence of their working together in the nuclear
                        field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: It was closer in some respects than we felt comfortable with, but it
                    wasn't as close as many perhaps suspected, either. The Israeli ambassadors
                    usually were very outspoken about apartheid. I can remember one of them who led
                    a boycott of the showing of the film Golda that was to have been segregated. He
                    insisted that the Diplomatic Corps join him, which we did, in not attending a
                    segregated film session. There were other occasions, too, where the Israelis
                    were quite outspoken.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>On the other hand, as occurs in other parts of the world, the Israelis were
                    interested in technical cooperation that was seen perhaps by them to be in their
                    own self interest. We would have information from time to time of certain types
                    of experts arriving in South Africa, and we assumed from that there was, indeed,
                    a degree of cooperation, part of which, of course, was openly known. It was a
                    kind of cooperation that we certainly did not regard with favor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Another delicate question: Do you feel the South African
                        Government welcomed your departure, hoping that the Reagan Administration
                        might appoint someone more sympathetic to their view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Not delicate at all. Quite the contrary, they certainly did welcome
                    it. The Government didn't say anything as such. The National Party Press and the
                    Afrikaans papers certainly welcomed it. Foreign (?) Minister Pieter Botha, on
                    the other hand, was very gracious, had a very nice luncheon for me. My wife, who
                    happened at that Fourth of July party we talked about, while rushing around to
                    have fallen and broken her wrist and her nose, was treated with special
                    courtesy. South African Government officials usually were very courteous, and I
                    had a number of people I felt were particularly close friends: the Director
                    General of the Department of Foreign Affairs while I was there, was always
                    someone I felt I could deal with very frankly.</p>
                <p>As always happens with diplomats, you nowhere trust everyone implicitly to the
                    nth degree, and you take what they say with all the other evidence you can
                    gather, and analyze it very carefully. But in terms of personal relationships
                    with most of the diplomats, they were really fairly good.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you departed, were you convinced, or did you believe,
                        that major changes were coming to South Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: My belief was that major changes inevitably had to come to South
                    Africa. The question was how they would come about, and how much violence would
                    be involved. I had developed over time a theory that has been picked up in a few
                    academic circles, of what I called South Africa in the process of “violent
                    evolution.” Looking back to Soweto and other events, there were changes...
                    Things had already changed even from my first period there, when I took my
                    daughter on one of her vacations from college to see the post office in Cape
                    Town where there were separate counters for Whites, Blacks, and Coloreds just to
                    get stamps or money orders. It looked like a railroad station with different
                    trains. Even a bench would be divided, with one end of the bench marked for
                    Whites only, in Afrikaans, and the other for non-Whites, nieblunk. That had
                    disappeared.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Towards the end of my first time there (I was charg� there four different times,
                    and for quite a long period at one point), I went with some other diplomats to a
                    luncheon at one of the banks. It was a very, very nice luncheon... They
                    explained how their policies were going, and that they now had an area where
                    Blacks could go and deal in their own languages — they had several local
                    languages there being spoken — but they could also go down below at the main
                    counters. The Greek Ambassador and I, after we had said our good-byes (I think
                    we were perhaps the last to leave), walked about a half a block down, and we'd
                    gone out past an African guard. We left, but I said, “Let's go back and ask that
                    guard what the upstairs there [what we had just seen] is for.”</p>
                <p>We went back and asked him. He said, “That's for Blacks.” We said, “Can't Blacks
                    go downstairs?” He replied, “Oh, no, Blacks have to go upstairs.” So from the
                    point of view of the Africans, it was clear that there was still a form of
                    segregation, in spite of what the bank management might have said, or maybe even
                    intended. We couldn't be sure, and we were obviously a little bit cynical.</p>
                <p>By the time I returned, it was a real pleasure to go into the bank and get in
                    line at a teller and find there were Blacks and Whites in the same line.
                    Subsequently I went through South Africa on a visit elsewhere in southern
                    Africa, on a USIA speaking tour, and noticed that even more, in the shops,
                    particularly in the suburbs of Johannesburg, there were Blacks and Whites in the
                    same lines. There hadn't been earlier, but [by then] there were Black sales
                    attendants. There had been real change over time.</p>
                <p>You could argue that that wasn't significant change; in any political sense that
                    was certainly true. But change had been occurring, and there was an acceptance
                    of change. I should have mentioned that even during my first tour I had talked
                    to a couple of Afrikaners out in rural areas, and I can remember one man said,
                    “There will be Black government before I die.” (He wasn't that old, it might
                    have been a long way off.)</p>
                <p>The theory I mentioned earlier, of “violent evolution” was that there were
                    periods of adjustment and readjustment. Soweto was an excellent example. The
                    outbreak, of course, was over the enforced teaching of Afrikaans to all Africans
                    in Soweto, and the strike against that by young people, and one boy was killed,
                    and then everything broke loose. All kinds of grievances came out. You saw
                    people, then, wringing their hands, even the very liberal White South Africans
                    who were very concerned about apartheid, who wanted their government to move
                    much, much faster, were also very concerned about this violence. You could see
                    how they were being torn apart by this as they watched these things for the
                    first time on television, which had for a long time been prohibited but came to
                    show this kind of news, so people saw what was happening in their country. You
                    could see people almost literally wringing their hands, worried about it,
                    wanting to move away from apartheid, but not wanting this kind of violence to
                    occur.</p>
                <p>Of course it also happened that there was a reaction on the Black side. They
                    began to feel, I think, “Who's getting hurt in all this? It's mostly
                    Blacks.”</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>So there was a reaction on both sides: there were Whites, who were saying, “We do
                    have to make some changes, we've got to reform some things”; and there were
                    Blacks, who were saying, “We're the ones getting hurt, let's find some other way
                    to do this.” Then there would be a period of adjustment, there would be some
                    changes, there would be some advances, but after a while you had a lot of Whites
                    lapsing back into the same old thing, and the cycle began again.</p>
                <p>So you had periods of violence and peace. You had strikes... They weren't all
                    Sowetos, they weren't all major, but there was a pattern that looked like it was
                    cyclical of a sort. One felt that this could at some time break through into an
                    absolute revolution, but the power [of the non-Whites] wasn't strong against the
                    military power of the State. The ANC/PAC really had little chance, and I think
                    they themselves came to that realization. One thought that perhaps, through
                    reform, through evolution, there might at some point be a breakthrough, but it
                    could either be a very violent one, or it might be simply through this process
                    of evolution that was not always peaceful.</p>
                <p>In the long run — after I left you began to see this — you had the ANC moving
                    away from the idea of armed struggle, and having more and more contacts with
                    Whites in South Africa... I had served before at Lusaka, where we had very close
                    relationships. Much was made of our having established a formal relationship
                    with ANC and PAC during Paul Herer's time as ambassador. But the truth is I
                    think we always had a lot of contacts with the nationalist parties of different
                    groups. We could see that they were using computers, they were calling up by
                    phone... they had contacts not only with their own people, but with Whites. When
                    finally you got a movement (so that you had this meeting I mentioned earlier in
                    the car), you had the feeling that the ANC leadership had come to the
                    realization that there were Whites who did want to have a change, to move away
                    from apartheid, to have a society where they could all work together. I felt
                    that over the long run there were strong elements that could be used to build a
                    peaceful change of a radical sort, over time. And, in fact, that came to
                    pass.</p>
                <p>Q;After you departed from South Africa, you came back to Washington and joined
                    the Inspection Corps, becoming Deputy Inspector General at the time. I believe
                    the people you worked with were Bob Bloun and Bill Herrer. Had you found
                    inspections useful when you were in South Africa?</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, I have to say, always useful. I will always remember my very
                    first inspection, Dar es Salaam, where I spent about a third of my time alone in
                    charge of the post. We had inspectors who came for one week... Nubigan was one
                    of them; I can't remember the administrative inspectors, two officers. My wife
                    was pregnant, we had a party, and then soon after that we had some
                    problems...the child was soon born. The chief inspector sent a lovely bouquet of
                    roses, which he must have had flown down from Nairobi. But, more importantly,
                    being alone, and at my first post, there was an awful lot that I didn't know. I
                    found that the inspectors were not looking for something wrong to pounce on you;
                    they were looking to help you do things right. I remember they found a couple of
                    things we were doing wrong, and some things we weren't doing at all. They very
                    patiently laid out what we should do. I found it was a useful process, and that
                    set my attitude towards inspectors ever since, when inspected later in Bern,
                    Switzerland, and so on.</p>
                <p>And so I do believe, and felt all along, that the inspection process is a useful
                    thing. However, there are inspectors and inspectors; some are obviously better
                    than others. I had a real disagreement with the last inspection in South Africa.
                    (I had two, one as DCM and one as ambassador.) They felt we could save money by
                    not moving the Embassy down to Cape Town when the government moved. I took
                    really very strong exception to that.</p>
                <p>I tried to stay out of it when I came back to the Department. I certainly took no
                    initiatives until people came to ask me what my view was, having seen my
                    response to the team earlier. I pointed out a number of reasons why I felt it
                    was important that the ambassador and his deputy [should go to Cape Town].</p>
                <p>[The inspectors] wanted to leave the deputy in charge in Pretoria, but deputies
                    are, and most Ambassadors like to use their deputies as, alter egos: it's one of
                    the most important relationships in the Foreign Service. It can be a tough one,
                    especially for the DCM, but it's an enjoyable one. And if [as a DCM] you have a
                    good relationship [with the ambassador], you do what you know the [ambassador]
                    wants, almost like a husband-wife team, and it works effectively that way. You
                    can help the ambassador, and help solve some of the problems the ambassador
                    doesn't see, or be a middle person. The idea of leaving the DCM back would mean
                    that he or she wouldn't have the contacts that are necessary with senior
                    government people. [The ambassador] often wants to take the DCM along, or send
                    him or her, and the DCM has his own set of contacts. It should be that when [the
                    ambassador] is out of the country, [the government officials] look to that
                    charg� d'affaires as the personal representative of the US Government, just as
                    much as the ambassador. Maybe they feel better with the more senior-ranking
                    person, but if that charg� is good, it makes no difference. And to leave [the
                    DCM] in Pretoria to just be in charge there shows a total misunderstanding of
                    that important role.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Now [it was important to send the] political officers [to Cape Town] because
                    politics were going on in both capitals. We left the economic counselor and some
                    of the senior economic officers in Pretoria, because most of the economic
                    activities continued there, but they often made trips [to Cape Town].</p>
                <p>So, I was interested to see that [keeping the Embassy in Pretoria while the
                    Parliament was in session in Cape Town] was one of the recommendations that was
                    not accepted. (I think the recommendation was made several times and never
                    accepted.) I think it should be up to the ambassador to have certain sway over
                    how the Mission is to be organized. But I still felt that the inspection process
                    was a very important, very helpful one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do field inspections when you first went
                        back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes. I went out as the senior inspector leading inspection teams. I
                    found it was an awful lot of work. The first one I had was a series in the
                    Francophone West African countries. We went to Niamey, Ouagadougou, Bamako,
                    Dakar, and Nouakchott. This was all in a period of 6 to 8 weeks. I've forgotten
                    how long exactly, but I remember we did Niamey in one week. Even though it's a
                    small post, they had a pretty good-sized AID mission there, they had a very
                    large administrative operation, both for the support of the Embassy and AID, and
                    there were lots of little problems, particularly administrative problems there.
                    We had to come up with some special recommendations, which I think the post was
                    very happy to have.</p>
                <p>We suggested a team be sent out to help them get set up and solve some of the
                    problems, because the Administration was pretty messy: not the fault of any
                    particular individual — some of it was lack of proper training... but that's
                    what inspectors can do. Political activity there was well covered, certainly a
                    good charg� at the time. In Ouagadougou there was also a charg� between
                    ambassadors. They didn't have quite so many problems...</p>
                <p>But to inspect takes a lot of work. You look at all aspects — as I think most
                    Foreign Service people know, but outsiders don't necessarily — you look from the
                    top down. You look at what the ambassador is doing, how he is coordinating
                    policies of the country team, the other agency heads and representatives there
                    over which he has authority, how he or she is using his or her deputy, the role
                    of the political officers and their reporting, the economic reporting, the
                    consular work, protection of American citizens, relationships with businessmen,
                    promotion of trade, all of these things...</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>So we are interested, really, in management. It's not just an audit, accounting
                    of money... We are interested in that aspect: the administration. And we are
                    interested in any evidence of wrong-doing, of taking shortcuts where they
                    shouldn't, but we are most importantly interested in the overall management of
                    the post. Have we got too many people, too few people? Could we make some
                    shifts, could we do something differently? Sometimes the questions are open: we
                    simply suggest that an ambassador or post look at something. I found that to do
                    all that in a post in a week's time, we were working until sometimes two and one
                    time four o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p>Later on, after I retired, I was called back to fill in for a couple of chief
                    inspectors. I did, for instance, the inspections of our posts in Tel Aviv and
                    Jerusalem. Subsequently I did Moscow, Leningrad (as it was then), and Helsinki.
                    Inspectors have to work hard, and long hours. They don't get much sight-seeing.
                    They may be lucky to get out of the office for part of a weekend to see
                    something, which we did. Senior inspectors sometimes take their wives, who will
                    tell them what to spend their time on when they do have a little time off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that certainly coincides with my view. I've had many
                        inspections, and I've noticed that the inspectors do work very hard, and
                        long hours. Sometimes I resented their questioning, but I saw what they were
                        getting at in most cases. Did the inspection function change from 1981 to
                        1986 when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, it changed in several ways... The process is always changing and
                    must be subject to change, just as the Foreign Service and its posts are subject
                    to change. But we tried to get a more systematic approach, where we were able to
                    do more careful advance preparation in the Department of State before we went
                    out or sent a team out. There was always a certain period of interviews, but we
                    tried to get more specific questions directed to the post ahead of time, and to
                    actually draw up a prospectus, so that we had a feeling we had some sense of
                    where the major problems would be that we had to look into, so that we could
                    apportion our time to the things that we thought needed most attention. That has
                    again, I'm sure, changed.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of the period, there was a great deal of debate because the
                    Department of State had one of the first inspection systems. The very first of
                    course, was when General Washington named an inspector general for the Army. I
                    think the next to have an inspector general was the Department of State and the
                    Foreign Service, and increasingly, we had Foreign Service inspectors in the
                    Consular Corps, but that became under the Foreign Service Act of 1926, and later
                    of '46. A great deal of authority rested with the inspector general to
                    concentrate on management, to find cases of mismanagement or waste or fraud.
                    Investigations came under the inspector general, and eventually, afterwards,
                    security inspections.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>There was always a feeling among certain interested people in Congress that
                    somehow it was strange that the Foreign Service inspected the Foreign Service:
                    that the inspector general had been a senior Foreign Service officer, and the
                    team leaders had always been senior, usually ambassadors or senior DCMs who knew
                    what was going on — and that the inspectors themselves were Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>We brought in more audit-qualified inspectors who had been purely auditors, and
                    tried to familiarize them with the Foreign Service. So a major change there was
                    getting them involved. Part of that meant that they had to learn that while they
                    could audit the same in St. Louis and Washington, Philadelphia, or Miami,
                    wherever, that wasn't the case overseas. Our Foreign Service posts operate in
                    different political and economic environments, there are different banking
                    systems and administrative requirements, you can't insist on the same kind of
                    receipts, you are often dealing in foreign languages, so that you have to have
                    special systems to take that into account. The people who are inspecting need to
                    know how the processes work. If you want to catch people doing wrong, sometimes
                    it “takes one to know one,” as they often say. It was important [to know the
                    system].</p>
                <p>Towards the end there was a move to have a Civil Service operation, for getting
                    the Civil Service to inspect Civil Servants. But we now have a non-Foreign
                    Service person usually appointed as inspector general, and we've brought in both
                    Civil Servants [and Foreign Service personnel?] But fortunately the first Civil
                    Service inspector general saw the value of having Foreign Service inspectors,
                    and they are still brought in to help in the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Inspection Corps when we changed
                        Secretaries of State, from Haig to Shultz in 1982. Did that have any effect
                        on the Inspection Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Not directly, except I would say (I hadn't worked very long at all
                    under Secretary Haig: by the time I was Deputy IG, we were under Secretary
                    Shultz) Secretary Shultz was really very supportive of the Foreign Service, and
                    that included, of course, the inspection operation. He came down and visited the
                    IG offices, had some of our assistant IGs brief him, explain things. He took an
                    interest in it. He took an interest in the Foreign Service in other ways. I
                    think that is very important, to have support from the top in ensuring that you
                    have good management throughout the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. Because with so many ambassadors being very
                        senior people, political people, you want to know the Inspection Corps can
                        at least talk about them... and be backed...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Be backed up, that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Inspection Corps become involved in the aftermath
                        of the terrorist bombings, such as those at Embassy Beirut and at Embassy
                        Kuwait, where Americans were killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes. Some of this was after I had been directly involved, but there
                    was a whole change, of course, in the security system. We were very much
                    concerned, more and more as we went out inspecting. Of course, there were
                    special inspections of incidents like that, which come under the IG often, not
                    always. But more importantly, when events happen that require a change in our
                    organizational behavior, in our professional behavior, the inspectors are the
                    ones who help people adjust to the new requirements and make suggestions as to
                    how they can meet those. Sometimes we felt that there was a little bit too much
                    of an overall pattern of trying to enforce on a little, tiny Embassy what you
                    could expect from a big Embassy. So we would try to find ways that they could
                    still meet our security needs [without being nitpicking about the
                    regulations].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in such matters as the cost of the
                        new Embassy residence in Cairo, which excited a lot of people, including
                        those on the Hill?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: Yes, indeed. We did send out a regular inspection team that looked at
                    that, and I remember reading the reports when they came back. We were disturbed
                    at some of the contracting problems that occurred, and we actually found some
                    malfeasance in the earlier part of it. That is always an important role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you get involved in other types of issues such as that
                        of Ambassador Van Damme in Vienna divorcing and marrying an Austrian
                        citizen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: No. I don't recall that we were involved in that. But I remember one
                    question came up [that concerned] her allowing the use of the Residence for a
                    fashion show that particularly [featured] one designer (I don't recall the
                    details now). It's one thing to promote American products, and that's terribly
                    important. You try to avoid getting involved in competition, although there may
                    be some changes going on there now. But it's quite a different thing to sort of
                    “hire out” the Residence for use by outsiders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how about involvement in such issues as charges that
                        the Department had discriminated against women in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: A standard part of our examination of personnel policies from the
                    outset was how well offices in the Department or posts in the field, or
                    subsections thereof, were in fact carrying out our Equal Opportunity policies.
                    And how well the system set up to enforce that itself operated. We looked very
                    closely at that.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>In addition we would look at performance reports. If someone seemed to be
                    unfairly rated... In the old days we wrote performance reports on everyone,
                    which was part of the difficulty of the job. Eventually that was cut down
                    greatly to look at the reporting system. Where we felt it necessary we would
                    than write a report to correct what we felt was an imbalance earlier of any
                    kind. In some cases we'd say somebody should have had a better report than they
                    did, or a worse report. I am told over and over again, by people serving on
                    promotion boards, particularly, that the inspectors' reports were always
                    considered among the most valuable.</p>
                <p>In terms of equal opportunity, we had things like harassment: any scent of that
                    at all we were fast to look into deeply, and, in some cases, bring about a
                    correction. You also had the problem of somebody sometimes complaining that they
                    were being discriminated against, because they didn't get as good a report... we
                    had to look very carefully as to whether it had been objective reporting or
                    there was some racial or other bias involved. Our effort was to try to present
                    as balanced a picture as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Corps take a position on whether wives should be
                        paid, which became an issue in recent years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I don't think we ever took an official position on that. It does vary
                    among officers and among their spouses. Times have changed. We all know the
                    difficulties of adjusting to that. There are more tandem couples, so there are
                    difficulties in assignments, in corporations as well as the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>My wife and many others, of course, worked very hard... Her position, and I agree
                    with her, is that wives shouldn't be paid. That isn't to say they don't do the
                    kind of job that deserves payment, but that needs to be observed in other ways,
                    such as allowances on the servants, the household help, and that sort of thing.
                    As one servant said as my wife took off to the store for the umpteenth time to
                    get something for entertaining — we had been doing it over and over again for
                    several weeks in a row — she said, “I'm sorry, Wright, I have to go off to the
                    store again,” to which he replied, “Don't apologize, madam, this is not a house,
                    it's a hotel!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1986 you retired from the Foreign Service. How
                        would you characterize the Foreign Service as a career for young people
                        coming along now? I take it you enjoyed your tour, but do you think in the
                        future it will hold the same challenges?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>EDMONDSON: I believe it will. There are always changes, and people who come into
                    Government service or Foreign Service soon learn that change is a constant
                    factor. Nothing stays the same, and some things keep coming around again. I
                    would strongly advocate Foreign Service for anybody interested in it. But I just
                    spoke to a group yesterday of UN fellows, that corps, saying they were mostly on
                    internal assignments, with specialized agencies or UN offices, or NGO. One has
                    to look up with great admiration to the people working overseas now in different
                    types of operations, with refugees, in development... There are many, many
                    different ways you can serve. I'm not saying the Foreign Service is the only
                    way. It is an exciting career — all of these are — and I would encourage young
                    people to take an interest in international affairs, and if they are interested,
                    they might find a fascinating career.</p>
                <p>The world is constantly growing closer, maybe no smaller, but it seems to be
                    smaller, and you can really grasp it now in your own sense and knowledge and
                    imagination, whether it's in financial operations or representing government.
                    Now we are concerned about the environment, about problems of crime and drugs,
                    so they are all areas for specialization. I have a strong feeling that because
                    we do represent different entities, just as states in the Union maybe, we have
                    common interests, and it is a career with aspects that are difficult, sometimes
                    boring, sometimes terribly exciting, sometimes very, very dangerous. But it is a
                    career that I would strongly advocate for anybody who has any interest at all...
                    at least take a look at it.</p>
