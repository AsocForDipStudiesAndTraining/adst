                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 24, 1992. This is an interview with Laurent
                        E. Morin on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Could you tell a bit about your background...where
                        you were born, grew up, and education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I was born in Augusta, Maine in 1920 and grew up in Massachusetts, Ohio
                    and then mostly New Hampshire. I subsequently attended the University of New
                    Hampshire. I went off to war, World War II. I was in the Navy and had combat
                    duty both in Europe and then the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First let's get back to the university. What was your
                        major and interest at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I originally finished as an economics major and graduated in 1943. I went
                    back to school after the war and got another major and another degree in 1947,
                    this time in history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you serve in the military and what sort of
                        action did you see?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I was a Navy officer, a small boat officer, in the amphibs. I was in a
                    landing craft unit, comprising LCVP's and LCM's carried aboard an attack
                    transport. Our boats worked the large cargo ships and troop carriers hauling men
                    and material to the invasion beach.</p>
                <p>My first combat was in Normandy. Our ship dropped us off about ten miles
                    off-shore and picked up troops from other ships. I hit the beach about five or
                    six hours after H hour. I was commanding the 22nd wave and hit the beach at Easy
                    Red which happened to be the heart of the heaviest combat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Omaha?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>MORIN: Easy Red is in the middle of Omaha beach. The underwater obstacles were
                    bad, and I had to pick our way through the jumble of posts, timber and barbed
                    wire along channels cleared by shell fire, with the other twelve boats
                    following. I didn't lose any boats, but five others from my ship were sunk.</p>
                <p>Subsequently our ship was sent to the Mediterranean for the invasion of southern
                    France two months later. We went in with troops from Naples to the beaches next
                    to Saint Tropez. There I was commander of the 4th wave. My boat sank; it hit a
                    mine on top of a post. The mine didn't go off because it was set for a heavier
                    ship but the hull was staved in. We made it to the shore, and I stayed on the
                    beach the rest of the day trying to repair the thing.</p>
                <p>It was a lovely day in August and we were sitting on the beach getting suntans. A
                    soldier came crawling down the beach said that we had to dig in because they
                    were expecting an 88 barrage and we had better get under cover. I had four
                    sailors with me in this particular boat and I told them we had better start
                    digging a trench. One of the sailors started digging away with a small shovel.
                    He was jabbing away, and I said, “My God, that's not how you dig for mines. You
                    have to be awful careful.” There were signs in German warning of mines all
                    around us. I said, “You put your hand in front of the shovel and you push down
                    into the sand until you feel some metal. If you don't feel any metal you're
                    okay.” This fellow sort of blanched and said, “Hell, I am not going to do that.”
                    The other sailors wouldn't either. So I laughed and did it myself for the five
                    of us. We lay there in the trench for quite a while until the barrage was
                    over.</p>
                <p>Shortly after that the troops had gone in and started bringing back prisoners.
                    Many of them had just given up. They were in units in the German army that had
                    been mostly work battalions. We were sitting there on the beach having a fine
                    time getting suntans. Finally, the regular German soldiers started coming in and
                    they were all holding up their pants. We found out as they were passed through
                    the front line troops down to the rear, the troops started taking souvenirs. The
                    Germans lost their buttons, insignias on their uniforms and their belt buckles
                    by the time they got to the beach.</p>
                <p>Subsequent to that my ship was sent to the Pacific. We hit the beach with the
                    Marines at Iwo Jima. I was in the 6th wave there. The first four waves got in
                    and had very heavy opposition. They were pinned down on the beach and we were
                    held up for a couple hours It was a mess. By the time we did get in there were
                    wounded which we picked up. The hospital ship was just off-shore.</p>
                <p>I was still there when the troops reached the top of Mt. Suribachi and remember
                    the excitement on the boats when we first saw the US flag flying on top.</p>
                <p>I was also in the invasion of Okinawa, and my most vivid memory is doing smoke
                    boat duty around the ships with the kamikaze planes coming down at us.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I was in what the press carried as the last naval engagement of World War II. One
                    day, three months after the war ended, we were half way between the Philippines
                    and New Guinea when our watch noted a drifting boat or barge. As this was a
                    danger to navigation, the captain sent a boat out to sink it. Our boat got
                    alongside, and all of a sudden we saw the crew jump into the water and swim away
                    as a grenade went off in our boat. There were two Japanese in the drifting boat,
                    presumably from one of the islands where they had been abandoned and who didn't
                    know the war was over. Another boat was able to pick up our men. The Japanese
                    started shooting at us with a rifle so there they were on this little makeshift
                    boat doing battle with this large looming ship. Finally our captain had had
                    enough of it and turned our guns on them and sank them. I went out to recover
                    our boat which was badly hit by our shells. We saw a Japanese body but when we
                    got near it a large shark, fin out of the water, swam up, turned and took it
                    down under not ten feet from us. Sharks followed us all the way to our ship.</p>
                <p>These war stories could go on and on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I just wanted to give a feel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: After the war I returned to the University of New Hampshire for a couple
                    of years. I had married during the war and our daughter was born shortly after.
                    I looked around and decided that after the excitement of the war years, settling
                    down in New Hampshire would never satisfy me so I checked around and decided on
                    the Foreign Service. Actually I went to Washington with the ECA in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the Marshall Plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. Senator Bridges got me an interview with John Peurifoy who said State
                    would be better and took me on as a staff vice consul. A month later, in August
                    1948, I started the basic officers' course.</p>
                <p>My career has been very satisfactory. I think I accomplished things. I got what I
                    wanted out of it so I have no regrets.</p>
                <p>I have been in the Foreign Service and in State for 44 years now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your first assignment was to Algiers. Was that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From 1948-50?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. I might introduce that by saying that at the commencement exercise we
                    had before we graduated from the basic officers course, General Marshall, who
                    was then Secretary of State, was the speaker. He also gave out the diplomas. As
                    I went through the line, he shook my hand, gave me my diploma, and said, “Son,
                    where are you going?” I said, “I've been assigned to Algiers, sir.” And he said,
                    “Algiers hey, that's the St. George Hotel. Good luck to you.” Well it was for me
                    because I ended up living there. The St. George had been the headquarters for
                    the American military in North Africa...Eisenhower's headquarters, etc.</p>
                <p>I must say it was a fancy hotel but difficult because we were quite poor in those
                    days. We didn't have many of the allowances that you have now. We had a little
                    girl at that time and we couldn't go downtown for supper because it was too late
                    for her, but we couldn't afford to eat in the dining hall at the St. George, as
                    it was just too expensive for us. But we developed a scheme. We would order room
                    service and the waiter would come up, bring in his table (we had a suite), and
                    lay out the linens, plates, etc. and then he would ask, “Madam are you going to
                    have the soup tonight.” We always ordered the menu fixe, just one meal every
                    night for the two of us. That was all we could afford. And the waiter would dish
                    it out, very formally, one course to Ann and the next to me.</p>
                <p>We found Algiers was a real colony in those days. This was a complete French
                    society on the backs of the native population. The French had everything. It was
                    not like in many of the other colonies I have been to. The French had all the
                    jobs all the way down. You found the garage mechanics, the waiters, the ushers,
                    all those little jobs, were all taken over by French. The Algerians, themselves,
                    had nothing but jobs as day laborers, maids, street car conductors, and taxi
                    drivers. Everything else was French.</p>
                <p>I found that my first few days confirmed my expectations that I was getting into
                    an interesting kind of life. We hadn't been there more than three or four days
                    when we were invited to a big gala. The whole consular corps was going to this
                    theater. I was told to go, get myself a tux and get your wife dressed up. Off we
                    went in a consulate car. The theater was lit up like a Hollywood premier. The
                    Spahis, mounted Algerian troops in colorful uniforms, were there. We got out of
                    the car onto a red carpet which went up into the theater. The theater had
                    sweeping stairways like an opera house. On the way out it was the same way. Your
                    car was called by loudspeaker. Algiers in those days was great for photographs
                    of officialdom and flash bulbs were flashing everywhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The next weekend or so, the political officer, George Bogardus, who was a red
                    head, called me in and asked if I would go down to a nationalist party meeting
                    at a theater across town and observe what was happening. He couldn't go, he
                    would be too conspicuous. He thought maybe I would be dark enough not to stand
                    out. Thinking of every spy movie I had ever seen, I put on a nondescript suit,
                    didn't shave that day, and hopped on a street car and went down to Bab el Oued,
                    a workers quarter on the other side of the Casbah from the St. George. I was a
                    little early and walked around observing people trying to be as inconspicuous as
                    possible. Finally to use up time, I went to a bar. There was a pinball machine
                    by the window, and I started playing it looking out all the time waiting for the
                    meeting to start. While looking out whom do I see walking by, looking very
                    nondescript, slinking along trying to be inconspicuous, but the British vice
                    consul!</p>
                <p>My first early experiences sort of bore out the feeling that I was really into
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember the exact time when the situation turned
                        around, but were you there then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: No, that was later. I was there during the middle period, a lull. There
                    had been a very bad situation there in Setif in 1945 on VE Day when the French
                    bombed a demonstration that seemed to be getting out of hand and killed
                    anywhere, depending on whom you read, from 10 to 40 thousand people. The
                    Algerians were very quiet in the period I was there, 1948-50. There were two
                    major opposition movements but they were not terrorists but just held meetings.
                    In fact those two movements, later on during the rebellion were considered
                    rather friendly compared to the FLN. But at that time the French were very
                    suspicious of it all, and they were suspicious of us, the US government. They
                    had the idea that we were pushing this. The story in Algiers was that Roosevelt
                    at the summit meeting at the Hotel Anfa in Casablanca had obtained a promise
                    that Algeria would be given to the States. This was completely nonsense, but
                    that is what people thought. The French were most unhappy with the thought that
                    we were sympathetic to the natives and feared we might be doing something for
                    them. For instance, our phones were tapped by our great allies by using
                    equipment left behind by the US Army.</p>
                <p>I attended Arab movies occasionally, and one day the consul general called a
                    couple of us in and said, “Cut it out. We're getting complaints from the
                    government about you guys showing up in Arab movie theaters.”</p>
                <p>I remember my local secretary was approached...some young fellow made up to her
                    at a dance, and she got to like him. After a time he said, “Look, why don't you
                    tell us what's is going on at the consulate.” She said, “What do you mean?” He
                    said, “Oh, nothing much. Just who does what, what do they talk about and so
                    forth?” She said, “Oh, I wouldn't do that.” He got very pushy and proved to be
                    an agent, a deuxi�me bureau agent.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MORIN: So he said, “If you don't cooperate with us you won't get your passport.
                    We know you have an application to go to Italy on a trip this summer, and you
                    are not going to get it.” And she didn't get it either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time the French authorities really looked with
                        great suspicion on our consular establishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, yes, very much so. We were blasted in the Paris papers. I remember one
                    period when there were headlines in the French press...the tabloids...saying
                    “the American consulate at Algiers is promoting the nationalist movement.”</p>
                <p>Our political officer got caught in the middle of this. He had asked for
                    permission to talk to one of the opposition leaders. The French government
                    reluctantly gave him permission to go meet with these people, but they almost
                    PNGed him at the same time.</p>
                <p>Our consul general, who was a southern gentleman of the old school, was the last
                    person to be promoting [laughter] the rights of the “natives”, but he was, in
                    effect, eased out because of French unhappiness with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Algiers from 1948-1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I think I left on the last day of the year. We had a son born in Algiers
                    who developed an inguinal hernia at six weeks. The French doctor had him trussed
                    up and said he would eventually need an operation. On the way home on a American
                    passenger ship, the ship's doctor took one look at him and said he shouldn't be
                    permitted to move around and must be operated on immediately upon arrival in the
                    States. Well, he was operated on, but he died on the operating table. It was his
                    first birthday. We were, of course, shattered.</p>
                <p>With that, there was no question of returning to Algiers, and the Department sent
                    me to Le Havre, France, where I was economic officer. Le Havre was a small
                    consulate, there were four Americans. It was basically a maritime post. We had
                    ships coming in all the time, seaman hanging around the office, American
                    tourists stranded there, that sort of thing. Our lives revolved around the
                    ships. Although I wasn't suppose to be the consular officer, we all were. I
                    spent time at the jails, hospitals, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>One of the most demanding jobs was the meeting and greeting of the big liners.
                    That was before American officials were required to travel on American flagships
                    and before people used planes to any extent. So every ship that came into Le
                    Havre had somebody on board. We had all the Cunard ships, the French liners, the
                    American liners, and the Dutch liners. Invariably there would be somebody on
                    board we had to meet. Our job was to go aboard, find them, tell where they were
                    to be housed in Paris, pass on messages, help them get their cars off, get
                    through customs, etc. You would have the sort of problem where an army family
                    would have adopted a German baby, gone home and come back without a visa for
                    France for the kid...visas were not required for Americans but were required for
                    Germans. You got into that sort of problem.</p>
                <p>Often these ships got in early in the morning so often we had to be there at 6 in
                    the morning. We would sit behind the custom lines and watch for diplomatic and
                    official passports and nail the people afterwards. But we didn't have a sign
                    saying “American Consulate,” that would have been lethal. Every tourist on the
                    ship would have been after us.</p>
                <p>Everybody went by ship in those days. I remember meeting Mrs. Roosevelt, Philip
                    Jessup, Perle Mesta, and all kinds of people coming through. As another example
                    of the kind of problems you get into, a young lady was coming in. Her husband, a
                    military officer, was to meet her. He had sent a message to us saying to tell
                    his wife that he was on maneuvers and she would have to drive across all of
                    France and half of Germany by herself. I told her that and she nearly passed
                    out. She said she didn't even know what side of the road they drove on. Well, I
                    found somebody, some other army type, who was going out that way and he agreed
                    to lead her all the way across to where she was going.</p>
                <p>And the seamen, of course, were a horrible problem. In those days American flag
                    ships were running from the Persian Gulf to Le Havre to deliver oil to the
                    refineries in Le Havre. It was an 18-month hitch for these sailors. It was
                    terrible because the ships would turn around in Le Havre in 24 hours. In Saudi
                    Arabia, the Saudis would not let them ashore. So they were caught on the ship
                    for 18 months, and they had all these problems. As a ship started coming near we
                    would get a notice that there were so many people on board who were sick. A
                    doctor was needed to examine them to make sure they were sick and not just
                    trying to get out of their contracts. Some of them would skip ship and go to
                    Paris and live on their pay for a month or two and then come back trying to get
                    a job. This created all sorts of problems. In France if you break a seamen's
                    contract you can go to jail. They don't mess around. We favored the seamen by
                    saying that the shipping agent was responsible for them even though they had
                    deserted their ship for extended periods.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Not only did we help people coming into France, we also helped people leaving
                    France. We would have the hitchhikers, the destitute, the American tourists,
                    seamen, etc. Le Havre was the nearest port to the US so they would all gravitate
                    down to that point thinking they could get some job on the ships. Well, that is
                    not allowed anymore, the unions put a stop to it. In the pre-war days that was
                    the way our Foreign Service people used to get across as the government didn't
                    pay passage for home leave.</p>
                <p>One day I had a call from a woman who said that she and her friend were running
                    out of money and didn't know what to do and wanted to come to see us. My boss,
                    the consul, Sabin J. Dalferes, was a Cajun, an old FSS consul from World War I,
                    a real colorful character from Lafayette, Louisiana. He and I received these two
                    women and it was pretty obvious to me when I took a look at them that they were
                    lesbians...one was very butchy in her dress and the other was very feminine.</p>
                <p>They started talking. The very female one had had a job in Germany with the US
                    Army. When her friend showed up the Army fired her on the spot. They were now
                    running out of money. Their families would have very little to do with them. The
                    family of the feminine one offered to give her a one way ticket but nothing
                    else. They were just really hard up. They didn't know what to do. They were in
                    Le Havre and broke.</p>
                <p>Then they started telling us she had lost her job because the Army thought they
                    were lesbians. Dalferes got very uncomfortable with this and asked if this had
                    something to do with the Well of Loneliness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Well of Loneliness was a novel in the 1930's which
                        treated lesbianism in a very discreet way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: The more masculine one got up and said, “Absolutely not, I am not a
                    lesbian, I'm a hermaphrodite” She paused, “Do you want me to prove it?” She
                    started undoing her clothes and Dalferes almost fell out of his chair. “Oh no,
                    no,” he said. She continued, “Now look, I'm in love with this woman. She is the
                    only person in my whole life who has ever given me the time of day. I am not
                    going to be separated from her. We need help.”</p>
                <p>Both of us were very sympathetic to them. We managed to find them very cheap
                    lodgings in Le Havre, and later I found out that Dalferes had paid for them.
                    Eventually we made arrangements with US Lines to give them passage with the one
                    ticket the family would pay for. We went aboard ship and saw them off. Dalferes
                    gave them some pocket money.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>About three or four months later we get a letter from the masculine one which
                    said, “I have been operated on and now we are married. I want you, Mr. Dalferes
                    and your junior consul, to know that you were the only people who ever were nice
                    to us and we really appreciated it. We can't give you enough of our thanks.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, that was the kind of work I did in Le Havre. I was there for a while and
                    then the Department decided to change the consular district and transfer the
                    northern departments of France to Paris. I then went to Paris with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Paris from 1952 to 1954.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Right. My wife was quite ill. Those times we didn't have much in the way
                    of support from the Department, no medical support for dependents, no education
                    allowances. My wife fell ill and had a very difficult pregnancy in Le Havre, and
                    I had to send her home at my own expense. By the time she got back six months
                    later with the baby, son Lee, I was in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had two Ambassadors while you were in Paris. James
                        Dunn, who was one of the old hands of the Foreign Service and Douglas Dillon
                        who was more of a contemporary figure. Did you have any contact or observe
                        how they operated and managed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: No, I never saw them. This was such a huge operation in Paris. I didn't
                    know the Ambassadors. Everybody was invited once to the DCM's house. That was
                    about the extent of that kind of activity for my level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I was in the economic section. I started off with straight economic
                    reporting. That was not a very well run operation. I wasn't very happy
                    there...nor were a lot of other people. It was large and our boss, who was a
                    fine reporter on his own, just didn't administer anything. He did all the work,
                    working until 7 or 8 every night. But there was no feedback, instructions or
                    anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>After a time I was transferred to the commercial section. I was the assistant
                    commercial attach� and I enjoyed that a great deal. It was a very nice operation
                    with a wonderful boss, Patton Allen. Among other things, I was the one who
                    received all the visitors that no one knew what to do with. When the
                    receptionist at the main lobby would get a nut of some kind they would be sent
                    to the commercial section. But it was a fine job and I enjoyed it.Paris was
                    terribly expensive for us in addition to my wife's trip to the States and coming
                    back at my own expense. For instance, at the Embassy commissary you could only
                    buy things on account...you couldn't use cash... that was to control things. If
                    you didn't settle your bill at the end of the month, you were red-lined and then
                    you couldn't buy anything else there. This was a very common occurrence for
                    me...not being able to settle at the end of the month. So we ended up buying on
                    the local market a lot more than we needed to if we had had more capital.</p>
                <p>For instance, coal was a real problem. We had a coal burning furnace in our
                    house. Coal on the open market was sold by the five kilo bag which worked out to
                    over a $100 a ton. You could buy coal for $50 a ton from the Embassy if you
                    bought two tons at a time. I was never able to put $100 together.</p>
                <p>Also, we were obliged at a great disadvantage to buy our francs at the official
                    rate of 350 to the dollar while the black market rate was over 500. The embassy
                    was very strict about this, although the military and others accommodated their
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you are saying here is something that I empathize
                        with completely because I went through it too. Americans in certain places
                        were living very splendidly but in other places they really were hurting.
                        The gay diplomatic life was not that fancy when you were trying to support
                        yourself. This really inhibited our ability to get around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Exactly, and in Paris particularly where you had such a large operation,
                    so much brass and high level officers...that upper class in the Embassy was a
                    world by itself. We had very little contact with it in the ranks. It was like
                    being in the Department, there were so many people. Also that was a very trying
                    time in the Foreign Service anyway. This was during the McCarthy years and while
                    that affected the senior officers more than it did us, we still felt it. We had
                    the visit of Cohn and Schine coming through Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were two aides of Senator McCarthy who made, in
                        diplomatic terms, absolute horses asses out of themselves by running around
                        looking at what they considered subversive books. These were two young kids
                        with lots of ego and no intelligence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Right. And they were made the laughing stock because all of their stories
                    were picked up in the press all the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>It was also the time of the RIF, the reduction in force of the Eisenhower
                    administration. That affected the FSS officers of which I was still one then.
                    Notices would come out periodically, listing the names of people who would be
                    dropped. You had three weeks to get home if you wanted to get your way paid! Of
                    course this news would come into the communications center and the secretaries
                    down there would pass the word around. You had this going on all the time,
                    people on edge not knowing what they were going to do if they got fired, which
                    was what it was. So it was a very trying time for most of us.</p>
                <p>But being in Paris, itself, was such a delight to me so I was able to enjoy it,
                    but the Embassy was not that great a place to be in. It was a horrible place for
                    secretaries, for instance. Because as the girls told me, “It is fine to go to
                    museums for a while, but after that what do we do the rest of the time?” The
                    American males all went out with French girls. The American girls were left on
                    their own and unless they were real extroverts, of which there were a few, they
                    just didn't get around much. It got to be terrible for them; lots of tears.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although you were somewhat removed, did you get a feeling
                        of how the Embassy was responding to the Vietnam situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: This was 1952-54. Vietnam was just barely starting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am talking about the French side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: The French were having their problems. We had a desk for Vietnam...for
                    those three countries. So it was a concern to people and the Dien Bien Phu
                    battle was during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that was in 1954.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: The thing that struck me about that was the French soldiers coming back
                    from that area and from Korea earlier, would not be well received by the French
                    population. I used to say to myself, “Well, that is just terrible, Americans
                    would never react that way.” And of course they acted the same way when our own
                    soldiers came back from Vietnam. That used to shock me in those days.</p>
                <p>We had other things too. There was the Rosenberg trial. Remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Jules and Ethel Rosenberg were accused and convicted
                        of spying for the Soviet Union on nuclear matters. They were executed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MORIN: There were lots of protests. The Embassy would be ringed by these police
                    vans. There were signs everywhere of “Americans Go Home” and that kind of
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>Then I was assigned to Kobe, Japan. There the treatment was absolutely different.
                    We had complete support. We could use all the military commissaries, PXs,
                    schools, etc. and nice houses were available.</p>
                <p>In Paris, my daughter went to a French school, which was all right because she
                    was fluent in French and accustomed to French schools in Algeria, but for kids
                    who were older they couldn't fit in. In French schools one had difficulty if you
                    didn't speak good French. The French system, as explained to us by French
                    teachers, was to favor the upper 10 or 20% of the children and not bother with
                    the rest. The American school in Paris was quite expensive, and since the
                    government didn't pay for it, people at our level just couldn't afford to send
                    kids there.</p>
                <p>In Japan it was different. We had an affordable school and nice houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1954-56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Right. There, again, I was an economic officer. We had offices in two
                    cities. The main office in those days was in Kobe, which is not the case
                    anymore. We had a economic/commercial office in Osaka. I spent a day in each,
                    back and forth. I lived on the railroad line between the two cities, so it was
                    very convenient.It was a place where we really got into the guts of the economy.
                    It was really something. Osaka, among other things, was a textile center. That
                    was the time when the Japanese were starting to penetrate the American market on
                    finished goods, textiles, etc. The American textile manufacturers were really
                    unhappy. It was just beginning, but they could feel the pressure. They were
                    trying to push protectionist measures while the Japanese were expanding their
                    activities all the time, particularly in artificial fibers—spun rayons, etc.My
                    boss was tremendously competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Lou Gleeck. He had learned so much about the textile business that some of
                    these textile people would come to him for advice. I traveled with him and by
                    myself around various factories. We had very good rapport with the industrial
                    community.</p>
                <p>Another thing that Osaka had...it is the sundries capital of the world. I made a
                    whole series of reports on this. This is enamel ware, artificial funeral
                    wreaths, toy cap guns, strings of beads, Christmas ornaments, fountain pens,
                    cigarette lighters, beaded pocketbooks, toys, buttons and much more.Q: Sort of
                    the Woolworth type stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MORIN: Each of these items would have its own quarter. You would go along the
                    narrow streets and see people working away in stalls and ramshackle structures
                    making all these things. They were depending on the American market for most of
                    their sales. They were also great in copying things for the black market in
                    Europe; I remember buying exact duplicates of Parker pens and Ronson lighters
                    for fifty cents. So I made a whole series of reports. It was fascinating.</p>
                <p>We also had another interesting experience. In those days, borax, was considered
                    a sensitive material that we were keeping away from China. It was used in some
                    form of munitions. A lot of it was being sold to Japan for authentic purposes,
                    but more was going into Japan then should have been. We had the job of tracking
                    it down. I would go around to these enamelware makers. That is where they used a
                    lot of it. I would ask to see their books and they would show me how much they
                    bought and how much they used. They would get annoyed, and looking back on it, I
                    don't blame them.</p>
                <p>The other thing that is very interesting to me is the contrast of the Japan in
                    those days with the Japan of today. It is so different. I am amazed with stories
                    of Japanese efficiency. It was so contrary to my day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there in 1952, 53.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Where were you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in the air force at Johnson Air Field. An enlisted
                        man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Were you down near Kobe?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No it was a fighter field outside of Tokyo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Well. For instance the Bell helicopter plant. Bell was putting up a plant
                    in Kobe and I used to know the people there pretty well. The manager said, “You
                    know, we have to put three Japanese on these assembly lines where we usually
                    would have one American.”</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I had a Hillman Minx, a little English car I had bought in France. In Japan at
                    that time they were assembling Minxes in Tokyo, and it was a very popular car.
                    The Hillman agent in Kobe told me, “I have so much trouble with these assembled
                    Minxes because my people have to rebuild them here in Kobe. They leave out
                    things like the sealer behind the windshield and things like that. It is just
                    terrible. People much prefer to buy an English-made Minx.” And sure enough, when
                    it became time for me to leave he was after me to sell it to him. Here is a guy
                    who had a whole warehouse full of new Minxes and he bought my five-year old Minx
                    even though the steering wheel was on the wrong side for Japan. He said that he
                    would fix it up and get a good price for it.</p>
                <p>The whole idea of the Japanese being so efficient now is just mind-boggling to
                    me. I could cite dozens of examples of inefficiency.</p>
                <p>I left Japan and went on to Yale and got an M.A. I spent a year at Yale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Economics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was paid by the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. After Yale I went to INR.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, I was in the African Branch of INR. I spent a couple of years
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little feel about the African Branch in INR. I came to
                        INR in 1960 dealing with Africa, but you were there before what might be
                        called the discovery of Africa by the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Eisenhower years, before independence began
                        popping out all over there. What was the interest and impression of Africa
                        that you got while in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MORIN: Well, I was pretty far down the line. We were in a branch under the near
                    eastern division. You may recall that the geographic bureau, NEA, had divided up
                    Africa into a couple of areas. There was a deputy assistant secretary for the
                    northern half and a deputy assistant secretary for the southern half of Africa,
                    and that was it. We had a post in Dakar which took care of virtually all of
                    French Africa. There was a post in east Africa that was responsible for
                    everything there. The only thing of importance from their point of view was
                    South Africa. North Africa was still under EUR [the European Bureau].</p>
                <p>After a time things starting building up. I was there at the time the Africans
                    were approaching independence during the “wind of change.” By 1960 the whole
                    thing started turning around; you started getting new countries every other day.
                    I had left by then, I was just on the beginning of it. I remember when the
                    French got kicked out, or pulled out of Guinea. They had come up with idea of
                    having a system of autonomous states but still under French jurisdiction. They
                    thought that would sell, but it didn't sell to everyone. Sekou Toure of Guinea
                    had his country voted out of it and the French left there in a huff. I had gone
                    to a meeting in Paris about that...a Cycle d'Information, a study conference at
                    the Colonial Office to which the French government had invited a number of
                    countries to send people, and they gave us a sales pitch. I could see what the
                    French were hoping to do, but they just didn't succeed. It lasted for a while. I
                    must say they did better then some of the other colonial powers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were you feeding information to in the State
                        Department? What were you looking at particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: We had the standard INR studies. The Mau Mau had just finished in Kenya
                    and there was a lot of interest in that. We had studies on that. North Africa
                    was under EUR in those days, so we didn't get involved in that part of Africa. I
                    just can't recall what the issues were at the time. But mainly it was that the
                    new developing opposition movement in each of these countries was getting
                    stronger, Ivory Coast, Togo, Cameroon and so forth, and we were reporting on
                    that. I remember one paper I wrote with EUR, Eurafrique, on the relationship
                    between France and its ex-colonies. It was pretty obvious to all but the
                    colonial powers that the Africans were going to go their own way very soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned about the communists getting involved in
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, there was much concern that the communists might be coming in. I used
                    to lecture at FSI on communism in Africa. Actually there were very few
                    communists except in Guinea, but many people were afraid they would take over
                    completely if the colonial powers left. If there was any communist activity in
                    Africa, all the bells would go off all over the Department and everywhere else.
                    I remember in Somalia there was a Chinese traveler who was talking about backing
                    some kind of repair shop. I reported it and must have overstated it because I
                    started getting calls from CIA and all over the place wanting to know what was
                    going on. Of course that was the time of the Chinese railroad...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there was a railroad from Dar es Salaam into Northern
                        Rhodesia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: The Israelis were also involved in Africa. They were trying to build up
                    positions so that they would have friends in that area.</p>
                <p>Then INR got saddled with this horrible job of NIS reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National Intelligence Surveys, which was sort of an
                        encyclopedia on every country in the world. Kind of a make work job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, it was terrible. It just seemed to be so unnecessary. In the first
                    place by putting a lot of classified stuff in it, it had to be locked up in the
                    communications room in an embassy. It wasn't something that you just pulled out
                    of your bookcase and looked something up in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just died.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, but I had to contribute to a lot of those. I did a long section on
                    the economy of the Belgian Congo right before the break. I was told that
                    suddenly people started reading it after the revolution because there wasn't
                    anything else. That was the only thing I can say that came out of all those
                    reports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get into the FSO ranks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I took the tests in Paris, the written exam. That was the old one, three
                    and a half days. I passed it. I went home to take the oral but it was postponed
                    and then canceled because of the Wriston program. So I actually got in when I
                    was in Kobe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left INR in 1960 and went to Baghdad for a good solid

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>MORIN: Baghdad was very difficult living but very rewarding professionally. I
                    must say it was a really active place with a lot going on. I spent very little
                    time in the office. I was out in the community all the time calling on bankers,
                    industrialists, government people, etc. I had a car and chauffeur that I used
                    virtually all of the time.</p>

                <p>MORIN: The Prime Minister and the Regent were dragged through the streets behind

                </p>
                <p>MORIN: They had settled down from the revolution. They were getting closer to the
                    Soviets who were moving in with five year plans for Iraq and financing
                    industries and such. And yet the Soviets were not very popular at all. Iraq had
                    quite a large size middle class, many of them trained in Europe, particularly in
                    England, or in the States, and these were the technicians and junior people in
                    the various ministries. They were very friendly to us, although officially they
                    were not. Nevertheless we got around a lot despite this, and were able to help
                    them a lot.The Soviets had begun to plan a steel mill in Baghdad for the Iraqis.
                    A senior official, who trained at the University of Michigan, asked one of us,
                    “Look, I need some help. We have been given these new plans for this steel mill
                    and it is terribly outdated. It has stuff you haven't seen in the United States
                    for years. This is what they are offering to put up and the top brass want to do
                    it. I wonder if you could help?” We made contact with one of the big American
                    steel companies, through the Department, of course, and asked if there was
                    anything that could be done. The company sent one of their vice presidents, who
                    was going to be out that way anyway. The idea was to say that he just happened
                    to be going by the area and dropped in to see if by chance there was any
                    business he could get. I took him around to the government, and he explained
                    their latest systems. They were just putting in a new plant in Ontario in those
                    days. He explained that this was the newest thing and what they should be
                    thinking about it. I took him into the minister, himself, and he explained what
                    the situation was and gave the pitch to the minister. Well it had the effect of
                    slowing this down for about two years because these guys started having second
                    thoughts and went over the plans again. But at some point Qasim said, “Let's go
                    with it anyway.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Qasim was still the head of the junta?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, he was the military dictator. His picture was everywhere, just like
                    Saddam now. But looking back, he was much better than the current crowd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking right now about Saddam Hussein who is
                        probably the worst of the dictators...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: There were three coups during the time I was in Baghdad. The bloodiest one
                    was the one that upset Qasim in 1963. It was quite scary for us because we could
                    hear the radio...the Qasim side was trying to raise the people who lived in the
                    slums, the sarifa dwellers, to rise up against the middle class and against the
                    foreigners. These slums were just over the bund from our house. So it looked
                    pretty bad there for a while.</p>
                <p>But finally the new group won and that night word was passed around the city that
                    everybody should watch television at 7:00. At 7:00 a “Felix The Cat” cartoon
                    played for a few minutes. Then all of a sudden the scene shifted to the TV
                    studio and there they had Qasim's body on display. They had shot him and his
                    lieutenants right there. They held up the head and rotated the body so one could
                    be sure he was dead. They didn't want stories that he was hiding up in the
                    mountains planning a counter-coup. All his lieutenants were there too, all dead
                    and sprawled around. That was the evening entertainment.</p>
                <p>Actually it wasn't as bad as the 1958 revolution when the two leaders were
                    dragged behind the cars all around the city for a couple of days for the same
                    effect...to show that they were dead.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Qasim was gone and the new guys came in. It was interesting. These
                    fellows were Baathis. We had some information on the Baath party. Most of them
                    were young idealists, some from the London School of Economics, but a lot of
                    them were military types. So you had two groups within the Baath party. They
                    were terribly young. The head of the labor ministry was 19 or 20. The new
                    foreign minister, just a kid, walked into the ministry and when stopped by the
                    guard and asked who the hell he thought he was, said that he was the new foreign
                    minister...so the story goes.</p>
                <p>The Embassy was well plugged in to what was going on, and it was suggested some
                    time before the revolution that I cultivate one of the senior officers at the
                    refinery which I did. “Comes the Revolution” and behold he was the new minister
                    of oil as our people had expected.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The new team started up the government. It got kind of nasty though. There was a
                    great deal of torture and that kind of thing. Things were very much on edge. My
                    contacts in the banking community were leaving town if they weren't in prison.
                    Then after a while, the end of the same year, the other element of the Baath
                    party, the Saddam types, just threw out these young kids and shot them. There
                    was a lot of street fighting in our neighborhood between the Army and the Baathi
                    para-military units. I remember my son playing football on the street, and when
                    a shot or a grenade would go off nearby, all the kids would jump over the walls
                    and then, after a while, would come back out and play some more.</p>
                <p>The Baath party stayed a different creature from then on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During most of this time our Ambassador was John
                        Jernegan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, he was the Ambassador for half of the time. His problem was...Kuwait
                    was given its independence by the British. The Ambassador from Kuwait landed in
                    Washington, and the moment he presented his credentials, Iraq PNGed Jack
                    Jernegan because they wouldn't accept this. They claimed Kuwait was part of
                    their country. They had a huge map of Kuwait on the side of a high building in
                    Baghdad showing it as part of Iraq. They issued postage stamps with Kuwait as
                    part of Iraq. The funniest thing of all, they sent monthly payments to the Emir
                    of Kuwait, his pay for being a district governor.</p>
                <p>The Iraqi army started down and got to the border and we were all reporting on
                    this. But the British sent their troops back into Kuwait and that stopped it.
                    But the Iraqis have always had this claim to Kuwait. The countries are very
                    close in dialect and customs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude toward Iraq at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: We were hoping to develop it as a friendly country. Iraq is such a
                    promising country. It has such potential. Here is a country in the middle of the
                    desert which should be the most prosperous in that part of the world. It has
                    lots of oil, probably as much as Saudi Arabia. It has water...two major rivers.
                    It has no population crush and a lot of real smart people. There is much unused
                    agricultural land...all you had to do was put water in the deserts around
                    Baghdad and everything grows. It could be like California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that was very much the feeling at the time that
                        here was a place that really was ready to blossom forth in every way, and
                        yet...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. And they just can't hack it. They have one big political problem of
                    their own making. The Arabs that run Iraq have this problem with the Kurds. The
                    Kurds form maybe 20 percent of the population and they are not Arabs. But the
                    name of the country is Arab Republic of Iraq, and the government always plays up
                    the Arab side. They're not ready to accommodate the Kurds. This has been a
                    continuing war. It had been going on for a while when I was there. There were
                    some horrible stories. I was up north once and saw some of the devastation where
                    the Iraqi army would blast out villages and that kind of thing. Or they would
                    move whole villages down south to try to mix them up with the people in the
                    south. It was a continuing thing that goes on today. It may never be resolved.
                    It's unfortunate as it keeps the country from stabilizing and developing
                    properly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel about Iraq and the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: We didn't like the idea that the Soviets were getting in there. We thought
                    the Soviets would get into the Gulf that way so our overall strategy was to try
                    to head this off. One strategy was to try to make friends with Iraq and we did.
                    We were friendly with them and helped them as much as we could. We wouldn't give
                    them any military products but we were beginning to give things like trucks and
                    that sort of stuff. We had had a huge AID program up until 1958, but that was
                    cut way back. But we had a small one during the time I was there. We were trying
                    to keep the door open to Iraq and hoping they would come around and show some
                    sense. If they had, they could be a major country in that part of the world, the
                    major country. It was an unfortunate development. They still have the
                    potential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were our close ties to Israeli a burr under the
                        saddle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: It was a problem, but much less of one than you might think. You would
                    hear about; it was a subject that would come up occasionally. It bothered them.
                    There was lots of censorship. You couldn't bring anything into Baghdad or Iraq
                    that showed the name Israel on it in those days. Even things like atlases and
                    maps would be blacked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Saudi Arabia about the same time and we had the
                        same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I remember Newsweek and Time would come in on the British Airways plane.
                    In order to get them in, the BA people would cut out the pages that had anything
                    to do with Israel. People, of course, listened to international news, BBC, and
                    even the Israeli stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in competition with the
                        British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MORIN: To some extent. We were selling planes in those days and we had
                    competition for Iraqi Airways...we wanted to sell Boeings to them. The British
                    thought they should get some of that pie and they worked hard on it. We outdid
                    them. The British accused us at one time of playing dirty pool...the military
                    attach�s got involved in it somehow.</p>
                <p>The French weren't in at the time as they didn't have diplomatic relations with
                    Iraq because of selling arms to Israel. In fact nothing French could come in so
                    whenever you bought Courvoisier or something like that it would be labeled
                    Lebanese brandy.</p>
                <p>I remember one case, an American called from the frontier, which was quite a
                    ways. He said that they wouldn't let him cross, he wanted to go to Iran. He had
                    a Citroen, a French car, and they wouldn't let him in.</p>
                <p>That turned around while I was there. The French embassy reopened, and they
                    started getting into the act too.</p>
                <p>We had a couple more coups in Baghdad. Later in the year when I mentioned earlier
                    that the Baath party turned over, it was the time of President Kennedy's
                    assassination. It was also the time that Duke Ellington was in Baghdad for a
                    USIA program and was caught there for a week. Immediately before that we had had
                    the annual Marine Ball, and Duke Ellington was the band that played for us. That
                    was probably tops for a Marine ball. But Duke Ellington was most unhappy about
                    being caught in Baghdad as were a lot of other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you scared during these coups because a couple of
                        Americans were dragged out of a hotel...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: That was in 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but obviously that left an impression because Iraqi
                        crowds...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: The Iraqi crowds were terrible and the fighting was around us during the
                    first coup particularly. Planes were strafing the Presidential Palace which was
                    right next door to the Embassy. We weren't in our house but the house boy was
                    and he called frantically and said, “Say the house has just been hit by a bomb.
                    Is it all right if I go outside?” He was supposed to be guarding the house, but
                    he felt safer outside.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Then an interesting thing. In the second coup my daughter was teaching (she was a
                    teenager) a kindergarten class across town. The rebellion broke out so people
                    sent the bus to pick up everybody. It picked up the children, and, while she was
                    locking up, the bus went off without her. She didn't know what to do. She
                    finally found a cab but it couldn't get through the barriers. The driver took
                    her to a village below Baghdad. It was a scary situation. We didn't know
                    anything about this, of course. She spent several hours with a family in a hut
                    there. After time the driver found a boat and rowed her across the river, which
                    is quite a row, down below the city and then walked her back to an area that she
                    knew. She popped into Bill Lakeland's house. We didn't know she was missing as I
                    presumed she was with one of the mothers from the kindergarten. This could have
                    been a real tragedy as she could have easily disappeared for good. We are
                    forever thankful to that unknown taxi driver.</p>
                <p>I was the chief warden during these coups which means the guy that takes over the
                    central communications office and keeps tabs on private Americans around town,
                    sort of like an operations center. We had a boat for pleasure on the Tigris and
                    a couple of Marines went out in the boat and crossed the river to see what was
                    going on. The militia started after them and shot up the boat. Fortunately they
                    got back and reported to me. I was most unhappy. It could have been very
                    serious, as they could easily have been killed.It was quite a sight to go up on
                    your roof and see the planes zoom in across the river, shooting up the main
                    streets and the ministries. You could hear the tanks rumbling at night and that
                    kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>One of the best things about Baghdad from my point of view was that you could go
                    out into the desert and visit the archeological sites. There are thousands of
                    sites, mostly unexplored, some dating back to 3000 BC or even older. We'd go out
                    in our cars steering across the absolutely flat and hard-packed desert by
                    compass. It was like a boat on a brown sea. The sites would pop up like islands
                    as you approached. I loved it and still miss it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Baghdad and came back to the Department where you
                        worked in the Economic Bureau from 1964-65. I have you in the Maritime
                        Division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, I had forgotten about that. I don't have it on my list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>MORIN: Let's see. One of the things I used to do was the Ice Patrol work. We have
                    an international treaty which provides for following icebergs as they peel off
                    the glaciers in Greenland and float south. The US is responsible for operations,
                    and the Coast Guard does the patrolling. We get their costs and divide it up
                    among the 75 or so countries and send out the bills. Each bill requires a
                    Foreign Office Note type of thing. There's always some haggling over how much
                    each country should pay as costs are based on how often their ships crossed the
                    affected zones.</p>
                <p>Another job was IMCO, which is the international maritime organization which
                    promotes maritime safety. It was setup at the time of the Titanic...safety at
                    sea and that sort of thing. We have representation on IMCO in London, and we
                    were the backup in the Department.</p>
                <p>Then we would follow the problems of the shipping conferences. The cargo ships
                    that are on a regular schedule are members of groups that are in effect
                    monopolies whereby shipping rates are fixed by the conferences and the companies
                    are supposed to live up to these. They are excused from American anti-trust laws
                    for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Well, as you would know, the one offender in all this was the Japanese. They
                    would always be undercutting and making special deals for their ships. Americans
                    would quote a price, and the Japanese would still get the business it even
                    though everyone was supposed to be quoting the same. Also, the Japanese firms
                    always favored the Japanese lines.</p>
                <p>The Latin American Free Trade Association was a real problem for our ships. We
                    had a couple of lines...Grace Line and one or two others...that went around
                    Latin America. They were discriminated against by the local governments.</p>
                <p>We were involved in the Indian-Pakistan war because of the freight rates...again
                    the technical problems that develop from a war time situation. Sometimes there
                    were serious port problems. Congestion at Colombo often was a bad problem, for
                    example.</p>
                <p>I had an interesting problem at Port au Prince, Haiti. An Arab, named Fayid, who
                    had moved there and become a favorite of Papa Doc Duvalier, had been given
                    control of the port of Port au Prince. The whole thing. Anyway our shipping
                    lines found that they were being held up by him on port charges, agents' fees,
                    docking privileges and the like. That got to be an issue. It was resolved when
                    Fayid had a falling-out with Papa Doc and fled for his life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went into the African Bureau. What were you
                        dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MORIN: I was the alternate country director for Central West Africa which
                    included those Francophone states in the middle of the continent starting with
                    Gabon and all the way over to Cote d'Ivoire. The bureau isn't divided that way
                    anymore. I enjoyed being in African Affairs. I was liaison officer with AID and
                    was exchanging information with them all the time. I also handled at that time a
                    double-taxation treaty with the Cameroon.</p>
                <p>Then I took a wonderful swing through Africa for two months or more. It was the
                    only time that I've ever had orders permitting me to charter a plane. That was
                    great. I went all over the place. From Libreville, Gabon, I chartered a plane
                    and flew to Lambar�n� which is Dr. Schweitzer's clinic. He was dead by then, but
                    I called on his daughter and went through the whole clinic and walked around
                    carrying a baby gorilla. I remember coming into the airport at Lambar�n�...it
                    was a one man show. The plane landed and we had to walk some distance to the
                    river and then hire a canoe to get across to the clinic.</p>
                <p>Bethlehem Steel in those days had discovered this fabulous iron ore lode way up
                    in northern Gabon and the Gabonese government wanted us to finance a railroad up
                    to this lode. It was just a fantastic deposit. I went up to look at it. I don't
                    know if you know much about iron, but the ore was about 70% iron, which means it
                    is almost pure from the point of view of working with it. It was granulated, you
                    could scoop up handfuls of it. The Bethlehem steel man who took me up said the
                    mountains were just full of it. But it was so far from the coast and too
                    expensive to exploit. He thought it would be something that would be developed
                    in the future.</p>
                <p>Anyway we went up by plane, flew over the mining site where there were just a few
                    people. The plane made a lot of noise and attracted their attention. Then we
                    went down to a little clearing in the jungle. The plane left us and we waited
                    for about a hour until finally a truck appeared and picked us up and took us up
                    to the mining camp. I went through the mine with my host. Early next morning he
                    took me gorilla hunting up in the mountains. We found a lot of nests but didn't
                    see any live ones. Anyway it was very exciting being way up in the jungle where
                    the long hanging vines reminded me of Tarzan. I tried swinging on them, and you
                    really could go quite a ways up with them.</p>
                <p>The next day on the way home instead of taking a plane we went in a very large
                    dugout canoe with a motor on it for a five hour ride down this river, the Ogou�,
                    a huge river with the jungle hanging over it. Saw no people...Gabon has no
                    population to speak of. We went all the way down to the first frontier town
                    where the plane picked us up. It was a real enjoyable time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you noticed a change in attitude towards these
                        countries in the Department...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MORIN: Oh, yes. This was 1967. The Department had become interested in Africa
                    after 1960. The change was the fact that these countries had become independent
                    and were now members of the UN. Instead of being internal problems of Belgium or
                    France or other, they were now international issues. Our AID programs grew. We
                    had differences with France over the questions of the Central African countries;
                    you see they were still under the French monetary structure so that was a
                    disadvantage from our trading point of view. The new countries had great
                    expectations and thought they would be better off independent, but that wasn't
                    to be.</p>
                <p>Then I was next assigned as DCM to Chad, but my wife couldn't pass the physical
                    so I didn't go. I went back to Algiers instead. There I found a tremendous
                    contrast to what it had been. Here it was a complete Algerian society where it
                    had been completely French before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1967-70. What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I was economic officer, but also the number two there. We were small and
                    limited by the Algerians. We were a section of the Swiss Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was because of the 1967 war with Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes, most of the Arab states broke relations with us then.</p>
                <p>We were assigned to the Swiss Embassy. We had a limited number of people. I think
                    it was 5 or 6 officers. So we all did everything. The Swiss flag flew over our
                    Embassy. We had letters of protection from the Swiss Ambassador pasted on our
                    houses. When we had any formal contacts with the Algerian government, diplomatic
                    notes, etc., they all had to be done by or through the Swiss Ambassador. The
                    Swiss charged us for everything. This kind of service was very expensive.</p>
                <p>So we had to go down and brief the Swiss Ambassador about problems. Once in a
                    while our position was in conflict with his. For example, we had a plane that
                    came down in the middle of the Sahara. It was American-owned, Swiss chartered,
                    running guns to Biafra. There were problems over who controlled the plane and
                    who was responsible for the jailed crew. Anyway, he represented our side but had
                    his own interests.</p>
                <p>I hadn't been there very long when the three of us, the boss, Lew Hoffacker; Fred
                    Galanto, the political officer, and myself met with the Foreign Office people
                    for the first time after the 1967 break. It was at one of their homes, a private
                    home. We slipped in and talked to them about where do we go from here. It grew
                    from then on. We never went to top official functions, but we had many contacts
                    lower down.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Algerian government at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: At that time they had been flirting with the Soviets, but they didn't have
                    much use for them. They were looking to us more and more all the time for high
                    technology. The Soviet programs were irrigation ditches and such. The Soviets
                    and the Romanians had both given assistance with oil drilling equipment and
                    wells. Interestingly enough, the Soviet well drillers would take so many hours
                    to go down so many feet. The Romanians could better them by about 10% or so and
                    we bettered them by about 100%. Some of our stuff was so much superior that the
                    Algerian didn't mess around with the Soviet stuff if they could avoid it.</p>
                <p>Then they had contracts during my time, with El Paso for natural gas development.
                    We sold them Boeings which was quite an achievement. There was a chemical
                    factory that was going to be built. This was all at the beginning of the period
                    after 1967 when they were coming back to the Americans for technology.
                    Eventually after a few years they did renew relations with us. But we had three
                    governments that were without diplomatic relations...the Germans, British and
                    ourselves all had Swiss flags. So everywhere you went around the city you saw
                    these Swiss flags.</p>
                <p>One day I got a call from the Foreign Office. The protocol chief said that their
                    UN ambassador was on his honeymoon somewhere down on an island near Florida, and
                    he was hit by a wave and knocked unconscious and was in a permanent coma. They
                    wanted our help in getting him back. I said I would look into it. I got a hold
                    of Washington and we engineered an arrangement where an American medical plane
                    that was returning to Germany would come by Algeria and drop him off on the way.
                    So it did. They brought his wife and all their belongings as well.</p>
                <p>So the plane is coming into the Algiers airport and the whole upper crust of the
                    Foreign Office, who are all his friends, including the Chief of Protocol, are
                    there. I am there watching the plane come in. A big magnificent C-130 with the
                    first American markings seen in Algiers since the 1967 war. A couple of crewmen
                    jump out and scurry around. I called up and asked the captain if he would come
                    down. Sure, he would come down. All these Algerians are watching. Down he comes,
                    a big, black impressive guy who looked like General Powell.</p>
                <p>I should have introduced this by saying that the Algerians are very racist. They
                    were stunned to see a black man in a position of authority, this just didn't
                    happen in Algeria.</p>
                <p>I knew the diplomats at the African embassies. They used to tell me stories about
                    being discriminated against all the time. Buses would pull away without them,
                    they'd be turned away at night clubs, and that sort of thing. Algeria is
                    actually 10% black because the black/white line crosses the middle of the
                    Sahara, but the blacks are way down the totem pole.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>A large crowd had gathered by this time. The crew was in effect given the keys to
                    the city but they didn't have time to stay for anything except for lunch. But as
                    they left there was a large crowd of people...from government and elsewhere. The
                    plane started off, and as you know those planes are built for short fields and
                    get airborne very quickly. I could hear the gasps around me as this fantastic
                    machine took off.</p>
                <p>At the same time Algeria was trying to make friends with the rest of Africa or
                    show its strength, or something. They hosted one of those Pan-African Congresses
                    in Algiers. We got very much involved in that. The city was full of reporters
                    and all that. One interesting thing was that American blacks were invited as
                    Africans. There were two groups, the Eldridge Cleaver group and the Stokely
                    Carmichael group which were opponents. They put one group in the St. George and
                    the other in the Aletti downtown to keep them apart.</p>
                <p>I was down in a store one day and heard American voices around the corner and
                    went over to them. There were three black girls, young. I talked to them and
                    told them who I was. I was Charg� at that time. They said, “Oh, maybe you can
                    help us.” I said, “Sure.” They said that Eldridge and his group wanted to have a
                    place where they could meet and could I help them. I said, “Sure, I'll give you
                    a meeting room up at the Embassy. You can use the theater if you want.” (This
                    was an outlying structure across the road.) They said that would be wonderful. I
                    said that I would send my vice-consul, Conrad Drescher, a young hippie type,
                    down to talk with them.</p>
                <p>He went down to see them and reported back, “Gee, the girls were all for it, but
                    these guys turned their backs when I walked in.” The girls said that they had
                    talked it over and it wouldn't be appropriate for them to meet at the Embassy. I
                    never thought they would come when I made the offer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, both these groups, Carmichael and Cleaver,
                        at that time were considered militant blacks who were taking the line of the
                        1960s against the United States as an imperialist power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Some of them were refugees from justice. A couple of them had hijacked a
                    plane to get to Cuba. They disliked Cuba. They went around the world and found
                    that there is more prejudice against blacks in most countries than in the US,
                    and Algeria was one example.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Eldridge Cleaver and his group stayed around for a while, in fact a year or so.
                    Then they went on to North Korea, I think. But we had a lot of contact with
                    them. In the first place Cleaver had a baby and had the papers made out to
                    register it American. One couple had...these people were pretty sad, they were
                    actually refugees from justice. They were the ones who had hijacked the plane.
                    They had a baby that was not doing well at all and could not get any treatment
                    in Algeria. They wanted to take it back home where its grandparents could take
                    it over. They couldn't go home, as they would be arrested. So what happened was
                    that Conrad made arrangements to have a stewardess from Air France take the baby
                    to Paris and then pass it along until the baby got back to grandma.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Cleaver, Kathy, was a Foreign Service brat. Her father was a senior AID
                    officer. One day he came up to Algiers looking for the “kids” and came to the
                    Embassy. He wanted to know where they were hiding out. I said that they weren't
                    hiding out, we knew where they were and I would gladly give him a car and driver
                    to go see them. He said that Kathleen was very difficult. When she grew up he
                    didn't know what to do with her.</p>
                <p>We had a Thanksgiving dinner for local Americans about that time, open house for
                    all Americans. Eldridge came with two or three of his people. He was personable.
                    We had a lot of southerners in the oil fields, and their women were playing up
                    to him...Mr. Cleaver this and Mr. Cleaver that. He was lapping it up. He stayed
                    around for a while but the Algerians treated him badly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me something about the Algerians. I have heard that
                        they are sort of a special Arab people. How would you characterize
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: They are like Lebanese. The reason is because they had a heavy dose of
                    French culture. French culture and Arab culture are a heady mix. They are very
                    oriented towards France despite all the troubles they've had with the French.
                    When Algerians said they were going abroad, they meant France. French television
                    programs were carried in Algeria. The Algerian television service showed most of
                    its programs in French, more than in Arabic. The main newspaper, the party
                    paper, El Moujahid, despite its Arabic title, was actually printed in French.
                    The University of Algiers was no longer in the French university system, but
                    continued much as it did before with French teachers. France's largest aid
                    program was in Algeria. They had 10,000 cooperants in Algeria. The countries
                    were very close even despite this bad blood between them.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Of course you have thousands, maybe millions, of Algerians living in France right
                    now. There seems to be a backlash against them in France at the moment. The
                    French brought them up because they would do jobs that the French wouldn't do,
                    and now they are unhappy with them. For a long while they wouldn't let women up,
                    their wives. I don't know if that's changed or not. But when these poor slobs
                    came back to Algiers they were shaken down for all their money at customs. They
                    had to turn everything into Algerian dinars. They got mistreated at both
                    ends.</p>
                <p>I left Algeria and came back to Washington and worked in AF for a year in the
                    regional economics office. An interesting thing I did there was the ambassador's
                    special fund. Each ambassador is given a few thousand dollars to play around
                    with, to help out. They give out basketballs, put a roof on a school, or dig a
                    well. This was different from the AID programs. It was my job to decide the
                    distribution to each country. There were all kinds of hassles with desk officers
                    as they all wanted more money for their countries.</p>
                <p>I didn't stay in that job very long. I went over to OEP, Office of Emergency
                    Preparedness, which is a White House office...the trouble shooting office for
                    the White House. It doesn't exist any more. It was responsible for federal
                    programs for disasters...floods, hurricanes, etc., for the oil import program,
                    the domestic oil programs, for nuclear war preparedness and any other problems
                    that would come up.</p>
                <p>If there was a major strike, it was our office that would worry about whatever
                    the Federal government could do and so advise the President. Our boss, General
                    Lincoln, was a member of the National Security Council. It was a great job. I
                    had most interesting stuff.</p>
                <p>I worked quite a bit with the strategic stockpile; this was huge stores of
                    materials, 80 different kinds from copper to rubber, several billion dollars
                    worth, held in case we had to fight World War II again. This was a real pork
                    barrel as the reason we now bought and stored manganese or whatever was to
                    support the producers in someone's Congressional district.</p>
                <p>One of the big things was when the wage/price freeze was declared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under Nixon wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Yes. My wife and I were going to Mexico for a week on vacation, and Sunday
                    night I got a call from my boss saying that all leave had been canceled and to
                    come back in. There was a wage/price freeze that was going into effect
                    immediately and we were to manage it. Our office, which wasn't that big, tripled
                    in size in two weeks by borrowing people from all over the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>You can imagine the questions that kept coming up and had to be decided on the
                    spot. Nixon declared that the price freeze would take effect as he was speaking,
                    a Sunday afternoon. Well I had a case, Youngstown Steel, which had a labor
                    dispute and was in the middle of negotiations. One union had settled and had
                    gotten a raise, but they hadn't finished with the next union. Now they couldn't
                    raise them in line with the first group because of the price freeze.People had
                    shipments underway from abroad...at which point do you consider them under the
                    price freeze? We had frantic calls from places like Florida where hotels were
                    charging the off-season rate because this was August. They wanted to know what
                    would happen in October when it was normal for prices to increase.</p>
                <p>Some teachers sign their contracts in the spring and some in the fall. Well, many
                    of those who signed in the spring had had pay increases, but those who didn't
                    actually sign until the fall couldn't get the increases even though it was a
                    similar job at the same school. State had a problem with local employees...were
                    they subject to the freeze? How about Americans working for American companies
                    abroad? And so on.</p>
                <p>It was a time of real pressure on everybody. We got bushels of mail. So, this was
                    a very active period for us.</p>
                <p>Another thing I got involved in was the 55 mph speed limit. We were responsible
                    for oil policy, and oil was getting tight with various oil shortages, so we
                    discussed all kinds of things to do. The Director was giving a speech to a group
                    up in New York. He needed a speech and I helped his speechwriter. I added a
                    paragraph saying that one way we could hold down usage in case of an emergency
                    was to adopt a 50 mph speed limit. He kept it in his speech, and lo and behold
                    it was picked up by the AP and went all over the country. We got all sorts of
                    correspondence inquiring what was going on. Some letters were very nasty and
                    critical, while others said it was a great idea.</p>
                <p>It started picking up speed. AAA called and asked where we had gotten this idea.
                    I said that I had read a report that said that internal combustion engines are
                    the most efficient at 35 or 40, so I thought 50 was a nice compromise. The White
                    House bought it, and it was finally put into effect at 50.</p>
                <p>Then all hell broke loose. The truckers went on strike...50 is too slow for
                    them...and there were shootings along the highways at strikebreakers. We were
                    the office that took care of that type of situation anyway. We had the central
                    command where you sat all day listening to the telephones. Finally an
                    arrangement was worked out. Apparently if you are driving a truck under 55 you
                    have to shift down so there is a real problem at that speed. So the White House
                    raised it to 55. It has been on the books ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it has saved a lot of lives.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MORIN: Anyway that is one of those interesting things you get involved with.</p>
                <p>The main element, the original reason for the office was nuclear war
                    preparedness. The office used to run these programs on how many Americans would
                    be killed in case of war and how many Russians. We had a large staff working on
                    that. The office was also responsible for continuity of government. We made long
                    lists of who would be in charge in order of succession...number one, number two,
                    all the way down to 20, 30 or 40, figuring that an atom bomb might wipe out a
                    whole group of the population. We ran a hide-away shelter back in the mountains
                    where government officials would go and hide out in case of war. I was supposed
                    to be one. I guess the idea was if the bomb came I would leave my wife to scorch
                    and go hide away in the mountains. We were asked what medicines we took, and
                    they stocked all that. I don't know if you have ever been there but it is like a
                    village. There were more than one of these, but this one was on the way to the
                    Blue Ridge near Leesburg. I would go up by helicopter. It was very impressive.
                    It was a Buck Rogers sort of thing with a huge door opening up in the side of
                    the mountain. A Foreign Service Officer was running it, a retired officer.</p>
                <p>OEP was a fascinating place. But the Nixon Administration wanted to cut it back
                    because they were getting criticized at the size of the White House staff. So
                    what they did was break up OEP. They put flood insurance under Interior, other
                    parts were scattered about. I ended up in GSA, General Services Administration,
                    because that took the nuclear power and warfare elements and a couple of others.
                    I think I was the only FSO ever assigned to GSA. I spent a few months there. The
                    job kept getting less and less and my time ran out, and I was transferred back
                    to the Department.</p>
                <p>At that time the Inspection Corps had a 3-man team going out to the Arabian
                    peninsula countries. I was asked to fill in because one of the officers couldn't
                    go. I substituted for him on two or three weeks notice.</p>
                <p>We got to Egypt but Nixon was making a trip there and so we were preempted,
                    having to leave after two or three days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was his famous trip to Egypt. He was up to his neck
                        in the Watergate scandal so he wanted to head out to a place where they
                        loved him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: And they did. All of a sudden there were American flags all over. They
                    washed the streets all the way to the airport. They painted the curbs and fixed
                    up the trees. I went out to the Pyramids and here were these guys all working
                    inside. You've been to the Pyramids, you know you walk up the tunnels and there
                    are these wooden railings. The workmen were sanding them all down. I asked why
                    they were doing that, and they said they didn't want President Nixon to get any
                    slivers in his hands while up there.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We then went to all the Arab peninsula countries, Kuwait, Bahrain, Yemen, etc. It
                    was a great experience for me. I enjoyed being an inspector.</p>
                <p>On the way back our chief, fell ill. He had been having a bad time. I could see
                    he was beginning to act strangely. He got very concerned because our ambassador
                    in Greece was questioning something he did on an inspection in Athens, on his
                    previous trip. He got very shaken about it, which wasn't normal. We went back to
                    Egypt and went to Alexandria and did a very short inspection at the end of the
                    trip. There he just couldn't hack it. He was supposed to stop in Naples and
                    inspect the fellow we have there at the Naval Headquarters. He had to beg off of
                    that one.</p>
                <p>The other fellow was an audit-qualified inspector so he only did administrative
                    stuff. The chief started working over the inspection results and the final
                    report, and after a few days went up and told our Assistant Secretary that he
                    couldn't do it any more. He was just drawing a blank. He was unable to complete
                    the thing and would have to retire. You know you go overseas for three months
                    and collect all this mass of material, have all your interviews and the poor
                    chief couldn't finish it. So I said I would do it by myself, and I did.</p>
                <p>We were doing the Bureau immediately after, and I was on the four-man team. The
                    Near East Bureau was a big bureau. We had had six inspection teams out doing the
                    posts. My team was responsible for drawing all the reports together to make one
                    report on the Bureau. Well the first thing you know, one team member dropped
                    out, the auditor finished and, out of the blue, the team chief retired and there
                    I was alone again!</p>
                <p>I worked like a dog, working until 8 or 9 every night. I had to interview a lot
                    of people in the Bureau itself. People I had missed or didn't know enough about
                    to put all the pieces together. So, I finally got it out but it took all Fall
                    and winter.</p>
                <p>I had interesting trips as an inspector...Central America, the Caribbean islands,
                    Korea, Taiwan. The high point was, I think, the three months I spent in India
                    and Nepal. I remember observing the bicentennial Fourth of July on a houseboat
                    in the Vale of Kashmir.</p>
                <p>I inspected 30 posts all together and three Bureaus in those three years. I
                    really enjoyed it and could have stayed there forever. But they had a rule you
                    were only supposed to serve two years and then after that they extended me for
                    one more. The Inspector General said that he didn't want to extend me anymore
                    because it was a bad precedent.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>From there I went on to...well, I was thinking of retiring...in fact I lined up
                    for a job with one of our retired officers who was in one of the big consulting
                    companies and was looking for people to go out to the various countries to
                    manage development programs. So he had me slated for Port au Prince, to be the
                    leader of a team of people who would be giving administrative support to the
                    Haitian government. Most of them would be French people from the company's Paris
                    office. The company bid on it but someone else won the contract, so I didn't
                    go.</p>
                <p>This was fortunate for me because I stayed a little longer in the Department and
                    got a lot more money because we began to get hefty pay raises.</p>
                <p>I did want to leave, however. Ann was not well enough...the Foreign Service life
                    was difficult for her. She really couldn't go overseas anymore. They asked me if
                    I wanted to go to Casablanca as Consul General and I turned it down. I had
                    earlier turned down a good job in Beirut. At least it was supposed to be good.
                    The fellow who had it and who stayed on waiting for a replacement was
                    assassinated along with the ambassador shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>I decided I would work for another year or so and that is how I got into the
                    Human Rights Bureau. Human Rights had just been built up to something under
                    Carter. We had a very dynamic woman, Pat Derian, an excellent person, very
                    competent. She really pushed this. The number two man, Mark Schneider, was a
                    fellow from Ted Kennedy's staff. Many of the people in it were young
                    enthusiastic workers from the presidential campaign. I really believed in the
                    human rights approach and thought we really had to push hard on it. Because what
                    you end up with...you are not going to get everything you are looking for,
                    you're going to settle in the middle. But by pushing hard we established the
                    fact that human rights were a consideration in foreign affairs and they have
                    been ever since.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of criticism of the Bureau, as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in a country team in South Korea at the time and
                        Dick Sneider, our Ambassador, turned red in the face when you mentioned Pat
                        Derian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: I know he did. I was the one who used to send him stuff. They were most
                    unhappy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Pat. Derian operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MORIN: Her office was the most relaxed one I have ever been in. She was very
                    informal. Everyone was approachable, you just walked in the door. Everyone was
                    on first name basis. She knew what she wanted. She had certain principles she
                    was following. She thought the State Department people, by and large, were
                    playing games or hesitating...not doing what they could do. She appreciated the
                    fact that they had a lot of problems, but nevertheless she knew that if you
                    don't push some of these countries, nothing is going to happen. And she did
                    push. She visited countries and pitched her line directly to the prime ministers
                    and such. I think she was effective.</p>
                <p>One of the things that was developed while I was there was the Human Rights
                    Country Report, which was originally established as part of the AID program.
                    Congress required that we have a human rights report on any AID recipient. The
                    first year was pretty slim and then it started growing. Now it is quite a volume
                    which comes out every February. I was there when the first big one came out, the
                    one with a lot of meat to it. We had stuff from all over the world...from
                    Israel, Turkey, Paraguay, Philippines, and all.</p>
                <p>And these fellows from the embassies would come streaming in to the Department
                    and complain. At the time, I was on the far eastern desk for our bureau, and I
                    used to get visitors, all these dissident groups from South Korea, the
                    Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Tibet, and the others who would come in and
                    complain about this and that. Although we were sympathetic, we would receive
                    criticism from them because they always wanted much more than we could ever
                    give. We had a very active element among the Filipinos here in Washington who
                    would complain about us all the time. So I was in a very active job for a year
                    or so caught between the dissidents, the home government and the Department's
                    country desk officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were an experienced Foreign Service officer
                        dealing with a group of people who came in from the political campaign and
                        civil rights movement, and all, and we are trained to be unemotional and
                        judicial about this, was there a problem in getting them to see things in
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: They came to understand that you just can't run off at the mouth on this.
                    There were problems...we did have other interests. Pat Derian would attend the
                    Secretary's staff meetings, for instance. They would discuss that we were trying
                    to do this, if you put too much pressure, something else was going to happen. We
                    had a base we were trying to keep in the Philippines. We could push them too far
                    and they would demand more money then we could pay. So you have to ease off.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>The other thing is that no central government, no prime minister can solve the
                    problems right away even if he wishes to. You're telling him that they are
                    beating up people in prisons and he sort of knows that. He probably isn't doing
                    anything about it because it's a big effort for him. If you push him enough, he
                    knows we're complaining, that we're finding out about it, well, he will then
                    pass the word down and something will happen. You are not going to get all of it
                    to stop, but it will stop for a while in some place or other.</p>
                <p>In Indonesia...You remember some years before there was a revolution where the
                    Chinese, the communists...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in 1965 I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: A large number of them were in prison at the time...a 100,000 or so. They
                    were still in prison in 1979. We kept pressing and pressing until finally they
                    started reconsidering and releasing some of them. So it was working in that
                    case.</p>
                <p>Another incident...Portuguese Timor became independent and the Indonesians moved
                    in and took it. Scattered reports were coming out that they were mistreating the
                    inhabitants but no foreigners could go there. We kept pushing the government to
                    let somebody in to look it over. Finally they relented and let one or two of our
                    field people go in. They checked it out and the atrocity stories were true. In
                    fact, they are still going on.</p>
                <p>Of course, some of these nationalist movements are just as bad as the governments
                    they are trying to replace as far as human rights are concerned.</p>
                <p>Amnesty International was one organization we dealt with a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Amnesty International?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: They were really good. They would get in there and find out things. Over
                    the years they had developed a lot of sources. They were able to get a pretty
                    good picture of what was going on. You might say that they might tend to build
                    it up a little more than others would because of their whole slant, but
                    nevertheless they were considered reliable. In some countries they are permitted
                    to go in and make their own investigations, others they are not. The fact that a
                    country refuses, by itself suggests that it is trying to hide something. That is
                    a mark against it. It is surprising how much these countries responded to this.
                    They were unhappy with the kind of report such as we and Amnesty International
                    were making. Dictators, particularly, depend a lot on keeping an international
                    image at a certain level and they found that too much of this criticism starts
                    undermining them. I don't know if it is a matter of sensitive feeling, or what.
                    But it did work. It certainly made our people in the field much more conscious
                    of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Priorities for human rights on a scale of one to ten were probably one in 1976
                    and then Carter came in and started pushing it and built up the human rights
                    office into a real Bureau. I think now you find whenever you read about one of
                    these countries you will see that the human rights element often figures in
                    reports and analyses of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about beating up in prisons. Well, American
                        prisons aren't the greatest. Every time we would talk about how awful things
                        were you must have had them throwing back things happening in the
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: We are covered by Amnesty International reports too. That is true. The
                    American Indians would come and protest to us too. One group out there has
                    formed a group that claims it is a government-in-exile. They want to know why we
                    are talking about things abroad when there are situations right here at home?
                    People who work in Human Rights are very aware of that and often do something
                    about it. There are internal human rights activities too. Trying to straighten
                    out prisons, Indians and everyone else who is under a bad situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you received by your fellow Foreign Service
                        officers when you would come around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: They would get greatly annoyed at times. It got to be a game with the East
                    Asian Bureau. We would do something, and they would try to bypass it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Holbrooke came in as part of the new Carter wave.
                        He was a very young Assistant Secretary. He and Pat Derian were kind of like
                        contemporaries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: She used to annoy the hell out of him. He was trying to do something and
                    had other considerations than human rights. We had big troubles when we started
                    writing the human rights report. Drafts were going back and forth. Even now in
                    Freedom of Information, I see cases on human rights with dozens of drafts of one
                    report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Israel is one of the preeminent cases of strong political
                        pressure in the United States. Yet there is a problem. There they are
                        dealing with the Palestinians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Well, we used to encounter it on the human rights side. It was basically
                    the West Bank, the occupied territories, part of the country where people were
                    mistreated. Israel itself, at least for the Israelis, is a country with fairly
                    liberal institutions all through it. So we reported about the West Bank and
                    Gaza. Israel has gotten very offended about it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel pressure from the White House at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MORIN: Not for this. I think they just said, “Let it go. Let them get mad. There
                    are other things more important.”</p>
                <p>We did get complaints from Filipinos particularly and the Taiwanese. Each of
                    these has its own opposition elements and they all tend to use harsh methods of
                    keeping down people.</p>
                <p>But it was a good thing for me. I went in there for a year, just filling in time
                    in a sense. I had also worked for a short while on the administration side, in
                    the A Bureau, in personnel classification. I thought I could use that experience
                    if I went out as a consultant. The kind of work I did there was: Who decides
                    what rank people have; how many positions can an office qualify for; why so and
                    so should be a GS-13 instead of a GS-12 and so forth. We were reviewing the
                    Foreign Service. I did the economic officers, worldwide, rating them...not the
                    people but the jobs. I had enough of that in three months. That is terrible
                    work. No one is your friend in that.</p>
                <p>I retired at that point, after Human Rights, and started work right away in the
                    Freedom of Information Office and have been there ever since. It has been 13
                    years now. I have been there a lot longer than in any other place. I have been
                    the senior reviewer for the Middle East now for several years. In fact, I was
                    the first senior reviewer. The office started because when Freedom of
                    Information took off in the seventies, the Bureaus just couldn't handle it. So
                    an inspection team made recommendations that there be a separate office staffed
                    by retired Foreign Service officers to handle the areas they were familiar with
                    and do it on behalf of each Bureau. So that is the way it started up and I got
                    into it early.</p>
                <p>It is a massive job. The Department gets 5,000 requests a year. It's very
                    legalistic work, you have to justify everything that you delete or deny. You
                    have to make a legal case for it. It can be appealed and you have to do it over
                    again. Then a requester can go to court, and he or she often does, and you have
                    to write these legal briefs which can be a hundred pages long. Every document in
                    there has to be explained to the judge as to why it shouldn't be released. You
                    have to make a pretty good case because they don't want just blanket language
                    saying it is important or sensitive. They want to know why it is sensitive.</p>
                <p>It can be sometimes a tedious job, but on the other hand it can be very
                    interesting. For example, when you get a request for a case on something like
                    the Suez Canal, you have all the documents for two years or so altogether and it
                    can be fascinating to follow it through. In addition to denying those we think
                    are too sensitive to release, we can release some in part by deleting sensitive
                    portions.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>This is represents an awful lot of paperwork. It is possible for one requested
                    document to lead to producing ten other papers because we have to refer to other
                    agencies, CIA, AID, Commerce and so forth who have an equity in the same
                    document. Send out a memo and a memo comes back. It builds up and mushrooms into
                    a big thing. The requester has to count on waiting for about a year to get
                    anything. And then the Presidential Libraries have their files and all their
                    releases have to be cleared with us, all the sensitive presidential papers. It
                    goes on and on. Anyway I'm still there.</p>

                <p>MORIN: I think we've covered everything.</p>
