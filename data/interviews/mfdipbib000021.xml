                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 19, 1994</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>Today is July 19, 1994. This is an interview with Andrew F. Antippas, being
                    conducted for the Association for Diplomatic Studies. I am Charles Stuart
                    Kennedy. Andy and I are old consular colleagues and old friends, going way back.
                    Andy, to start this off, could you give me some of your background? You were
                    born in 1931 in Massachusetts?</p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes, Winchester, Massachusetts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me something very briefly about your
                        background—your family and your early years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: My father was an immigrant. He came to the United States in 1922.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume, from Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: From Greece. He went to sea in 1904 when he was nine years old and was
                    a sailed, mostly in the Greek Navy from then until 1922. In fact, he was present
                    at the evacuation of the Greek population in Anatolia from Smyrna [now Izmir, in
                    Turkey]. He participated in many of these events, including the Allied landing
                    at Sebastopol in the Crimea in 1917. He was an eyewitness to a lot of history.
                    He got fed up and jumped ship in Baltimore in 1922, as a lot of Greeks did. He
                    made his way to Boston, which he knew from ship visits and eventually set up
                    shop there. What do Greeks do? He opened a restaurant, married and became an
                    American citizen in 1936. He had two children, my brother and I. My brother is
                    two years older than I. My parents divorced very early on. I don't know why. My
                    brother and I lived with her for a while, but, basically, my father brought us
                    up. For most of our boyhood our father was very much our “guiding light.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work in the restaurant?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Oh, yes. We had to, of course. Winchester, MA, is a very nice upper
                    middle class, Yankee community outside of Boston. It had a good school system.
                    Probably, the best thing that our father ever did for us was to bring us up in a
                    place like Winchester. We did all right in sports and so-so in school. Of
                    course, I grew up during World War II and was very much influenced by what had
                    happened during the war. I pretty much planned on a military career, very much
                    influenced by the war.</p>
                <p>Before graduating from high school I was accepted at VMI [Virginia Military
                    Institute] and Norwich University both well known military schools. However, two
                    weeks after I graduated from high school in June of 1950, the Korean War broke
                    out. My father said, “Look, your brother's going to get drafted, so you can't go
                    anywhere. You've got to stay here and help me.” He was right. Within six months
                    my brother was drafted, and I had to stay on and help in the family business. So
                    that put college off. It made me all the more determined to join the Army, which
                    I eventually did. Interestingly enough, I received my draft notice about a year
                    later, in 1951. I took my physical exam but was classified “4-F” [ medically
                    ineligible to serve] because of a heart murmur. This surprised me, because I was
                    a championship quarter-miler in high school.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I managed to talk my way into the Army. I persuaded the medics to review
                    the situation and to send me to a specialist. I entered the Army in June, 1952.
                    I had been scheduled to attend OCS [Officer Candidate School], but the Army
                    reduced OCS requirements that year due to reduced combat casualties and a large
                    ROTC class.. I eventually got to OCS, as they used to say, “over choppy seas.” I
                    ended up as a rifleman replacement in an infantry platoon in Korea, carrying my
                    4-F card in my pocket. I never told anybody about that because I would have been
                    ridiculed. But fortunately, I arrived at my unit on the Eastern flank of
                    Heartbreak Ridge during the last four months of the war. I served there and
                    ended up by...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you serving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I was in the 45th Infantry Division on “Heartbreak Ridge.” The division
                    had been an Oklahoma National Guard unit. In point of fact, I was successful in
                    the Army. I was not wounded or hurt in any way and I ended up by commanding the
                    platoon in which I had served as a rifleman replacement—not as a result of
                    combat casualties but just because of turnover or rotation of personnel.</p>
                <p>That experience—wonderful as it was, and I enjoyed it—led me to decide that the
                    military really wasn't my “bag.” This was not because of the war, particularly,
                    but because I felt that it was clear that in peacetime there would be a draw
                    down of the Army and there really wasn't much future in a military career. Since
                    I only had a high school diploma, I was encouraged by one of my company officers
                    to go to a university. He suggested that I attend ROTC [Reserve Officers
                    Training Corps] and then decide about a career after graduation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the GI Bill, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I had the GI Bill. I felt not a little trepidation about going on to
                    school. I didn't have that much confidence in my scholastic abilities. It's one
                    thing to leave high school and get kind of caught up in college. But at that
                    point there had been a four year hiatus, and I wasn't really sure that I had the
                    ability to go through college. Anyway, a kindly Veterans Administration
                    representative in Boston talked me into entering BU.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: BU is Boston University? When I got out of the Army after
                        the Korean War in 1954, I went there and got my master's degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Then we were there at the same time. I started into Boston University
                    in January, 1955, in the College of General Education, in a two-year “immersion
                    course.” I got an A. A. degree [Associate in Arts] from that. It just “clicked”
                    for me—the intellectual stimulus was such. One of my professors was a young,
                    Harvard graduate, a history professor named David Trask, who encouraged me a
                    great deal. Later on, he was the Historian of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's now Historian of the Department of the Army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Is he? I had lost track of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's written some books and is here in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Is he? I really should get in touch with him because he had a very big
                    impact on me.</p>
                <p>I decided that BU was too large, the commute from Winchester, MA, was a “killer,”
                    since I lived outside Boston. David Trask encouraged me to try to transfer to
                    Harvard University as a junior. However, Harvard only took eight “transferees”
                    in the arts course that year. Later on, David Trask told me that I had been
                    rejected by Harvard, principally because my high school grades were not so
                    stellar. I applied to and was accepted at Brandeis University in Waltham,
                    Massachusetts as well as Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. I decided
                    to go to Tufts, which was much closer to home. It was a nice, little school—just
                    three miles from home. I majored in European history at Tufts and, of course,
                    started taking the Foreign Service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you hear about the Foreign Service exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, it was advertised, of course. It was the practice at that time in
                    college—as you might recall—to take every exam that came along—civil service,
                    Foreign Service, and so forth, because working for the government was considered
                    “honorable” in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was also the “intern” program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. Things like that. So I just took these exams regularly—every year.
                    Like most people, I had had very little exposure to the diplomatic service. I
                    had stayed in the Army Reserve, as sort of a recreational outlet. It provided a
                    little money and a vacation every summer, since I regularly attended summer
                    school and worked after hours at my father's restaurant. My Army Reserve unit,
                    the 301st Infantry of the 94th Infantry Division used to go to Pine Camp [now
                    Fort Drum], NY, for summer training. Over the weekend in the middle of the
                    training course most people went to Montreal or some place like that for the
                    usual diversion, whatever GI's do.</p>
                <p>I went to Montreal a couple of times over the next five years. As I think back on
                    it, I saw the Consulate General there and thought, “That's kind of interesting.”
                    I'd never really seen a consulate anywhere else. I told this story many times in
                    Montreal, which was my last post in the Foreign Service. I used to say that I
                    walked around, in 1954 and 1955 in my uniform, with my boots “bloused” [pants
                    tucked into the boots] and got very hard looks from the local citizenry.
                    Apparently, in 1951 an American airborne division had made practice parachute
                    drops on Pine Camp or Camp Drum. They had been given leave, went to Montreal,
                    and “tore the place apart.” Montreal was a “wide open” town, a great party town
                    in those days.</p>
                <p>I began to think over time that a “diplomatic career sounds kind of good to me.”
                    I was taking diplomatic and European history as a major. The diplomatic service
                    sounded as if you wouldn't have to work too hard—no heavy lifting in the hot sun
                    so to speak.</p>
                <p>I took the Foreign Service exam beginning in late 1956 following the Suez and
                    Hungarian crises but failed it a couple of times. Finally, I passed the written
                    exam and took the oral exam in the summer of 1958—the year I received my BA from
                    Tufts. I was not accepted—whether from my own, obvious failings, or because it
                    was a recession year, and the State Department was not taking in a lot of
                    candidates that particular year. The chairman of the Government Department at
                    Tufts at the time was Robert R. Robbins. Robbins had served in the Department
                    for 15 years in IO [Bureau of International Organization Affairs] in the Office
                    of Dependent Areas Affairs. He was a trust territory expert—a very nice guy from
                    Ohio. Very soft spoken, contemplative and “laid back.” He sympathized with me
                    that year. He said, “You know, I think that you really got 'shafted.' He said
                    they give the Foreign Service exam but really don't have any slots to put people
                    into. They will take very few people.” The one individual from Tufts who was
                    accepted into the Department was such a “jerk” in my opinion, that I couldn't
                    imagine what on earth the Department could see in him.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Robbins told me, “Listen, I'm initiating a graduate program in public
                    administration, leading to a master's degree. Would you like to be the first
                    candidate?” This took me aback because my grades at Tufts hadn't been all of
                    that great, either. But he showed such great faith in me that I decided to
                    accept it. At about that same time I had received a direct commission as an
                    officer in the Army Reserve. Under a special program if you had combat
                    experience and were a non-commissioned officer in the reserves, you could apply
                    for a commission. I applied and received my commission belatedly six years after
                    joining the army during the Korean War. I was toying with the idea of going back
                    into the Army. 1958 was a hard year—a time of recession. Remember the slogan
                    that the Federal Government put out—”You 'auto' buy an auto”? This was an
                    attempt to pump prime the economy. Anyway, I got my commission but decided that
                    the graduate degree program looked like a good idea.</p>
                <p>I worked under Professor Morris Lambie, who had been at the Littauer Center for
                    Public Administration at Harvard. Lambie had retired from there but wanted to
                    continue teaching. He was hired by Tufts to start the graduate program. I
                    studied state and local government under him as his teaching assistant. I
                    thought then that what I would like to be was a city manager. I worked in this
                    program through 1959 until January, 1960.</p>
                <p>Then I passed the Foreign Service exam—having taken it more or less out of habit,
                    of course. I guess I was more relaxed on this occasion because I passed it. The
                    Department of State accepted me in the summer of 1960 and offered me an
                    appointment. By then I had begun a job as Executive Director of the Cambridge
                    Civic Association [CCA], a municipal reform group in Cambridge, Massachusetts
                    dedicated to the support of the city manager form of government. It had 3,000
                    members, including luminaries from Harvard, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of
                    Technology], and the business community—people like John Kenneth Galbraith.I had
                    started out in the CCA job but then decided that I could always be a city
                    manager or local government activist, but couldn't always be a Foreign Service
                    Officer. At that time the age limit was 31 for people entering the Foreign
                    Service. I decided, “Why not? I don't know much about the Foreign Service but I
                    can give it a whirl.”</p>
                <p>In my entering class at the Foreign Service Institute [in 1960] there were three
                    who were my age of 29 in my class of seventeen. The others, fifteen men and two
                    women, at least half were pretty much fresh out of college—22, 23 years old.
                    They were bright and eager. I think that we had two men who were Russian
                    specialists already—who were interested in the Russian language. One member of
                    the class was a nephew of then Congressman Boggs—future Speaker of the House of
                    Representatives. I think that over half a dozen of the class including one of
                    the women, had served in the military. I think that the class was imbued with
                    the feelings that existed then—reflected by the Kennedy era and the line from
                    Kennedy's inaugural speech, “...Ask not what your country...” etc.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This came somewhat later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Not the Peace Corps humanist view but in any event similar to my
                    feelings then, that is: interested in foreign affairs and the future of our
                    country, the Cold War, and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't want to put words in your mouth but I think that
                        there was a feeling that we had something to offer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. We felt that it was a great honor to be in the Foreign
                    Service. I think that we all felt that. It wasn't just a job. To be selected for
                    the Foreign Service was a great privilege. I don't think that anybody in the
                    class expected to be an Ambassador right away. It was made very clear to us that
                    it was going to take a while to work our way up the ladder, and that was OK with
                    me. We really didn't know that much about what this business was all about. I
                    certainly didn't and was marching along very carefully. I don't know whether I
                    did all of that well in the A-100 course [at the Foreign Service Institute] in
                    things like role playing. I think that I was more relaxed and jocular than most
                    people in the class. But we were very enthusiastic, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after finishing the A-100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We were all given our initial assignments, of course. This shows you
                    how much the Department and our society has changed. The woman in Personnel who
                    was assigning the new officers looked at my file and said, “Gee, you're 29 years
                    old and not married. I think that we'd better leave you in Washington for your
                    first tour and get you married off before you go overseas.” She actually said
                    that. She'd probably be sued today if she said something like that! I thought,
                    “Yeah, I guess that makes sense.” I was having a ball in Washington as a single,
                    unmarried male. I thought that it was a terrific town to be in.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to IO [Bureau of International Organization Affairs] in the Office
                    of International Conferences. I became a Conference Officer, which was kind of
                    interesting. It gave me a sort of “Cook's Tour” of the Federal Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Arranging the program for U. S. delegations to conferences. I would be
                    given a stable of international organizations to follow which had conferences
                    every year. I remember that IMCO [International Maritime Organization] was one
                    of “my” conferences. Now it's called IMO. I also worked on the International
                    Civil Aviation Organization, which is headquartered in Montreal. There were also
                    ad hoc conferences. One of them was called PIANC. I can't remember what that
                    meant, but it had to do with American ports. I had to arrange the Secretary of
                    State's participation in that conference in Baltimore. It was no big deal.
                    However, it got me up to the seventh floor of the Department [where the
                    Secretary's office suite is located]. Coby Swank [Emory Coblentz Swank] was then
                    the Secretary's Senior Special Assistant. I later served under him when he was
                    Ambassador to Cambodia—an awfully nice man.</p>
                <p>For a junior officer to go up to the Secretary's office and not be “devoured” by
                    somebody was quite a nice experience. Coby was very helpful, easy-going, and
                    “laid back.” I never forgot that. That was a very pleasant interlude.</p>
                <p>In any case, we dealt with the delegations and made sure that the position papers
                    and other documents were all put together and that the delegation left
                    Washington on time.</p>
                <p>I managed to go to two major conferences in the first year. In September 1961, I
                    went to Vienna as secretary of the delegation to two, back to back conferences.
                    One was the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] General conference, an
                    annual event. The IAEA is headquartered in Vienna. The World Bank and
                    International Monetary Fund were having their meetings there as well just
                    following that. So I spent a month in Vienna in September 1961.</p>
                <p>This was a fascinating time to be there. President Kennedy had met Khrushchev in
                    Vienna in June 1961, and been humiliated. Everyone was still talking about it
                    three months later. Here is a little bit of history. There was a reception at
                    the IAEA conference on the first day at the Hofburg Palace, where they had all
                    of their big diplomatic social events. There was a big, mob scene, with
                    everybody standing around, holding a drink. I was standing there, not knowing a
                    soul, and with nobody to talk to, perhaps the most junior guy there. The man who
                    was standing behind me came up and grunted, “My name is Molotov.” And it was
                    Vyacheslav Molotov [long-time Soviet Foreign Minister and senior Soviet leader].
                    Molotov was the Soviet representative to the IAEA. He was on his way down. He
                    wound up running an electric power project in Siberia. I looked at him and
                    thought, “It is, indeed, Molotov.” I didn't know what to do. Should I ignore
                    him, pour my drink on him, or what? So I just kind of ignored him. I turned my
                    back on him and snubbed him. I don't think that he even knew the difference, but
                    I can tell my grandchildren that I snubbed the man who started World War II [the
                    Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement leading to the war was signed in August, 1939].</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>That was an interesting conference because all of the “key” figures on the
                    American delegation were from the Atomic Energy Commission and had been involved
                    with the Manhattan Project [the project to develop the atomic bomb in the United
                    States during World War II]. They were the sum and substance of the American
                    nuclear program. I sort of observed all of this and could say that I saw all of
                    these people.</p>
                <p>I spent 2 � years in IO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1960 to 1963.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: In the Department from 1961 to 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the Kennedy administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about this? I think that for all of us the
                        coming of the Kennedy administration was not an absolute delight for the
                        Department of State. There were a lot of very young, eager people running
                        around. Could you give us your impressions of the Kennedy
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I came with a bias. First, I was from Massachusetts, and I am, or was,
                    a Republican. Not everybody from Massachusetts at that time thought that the
                    Kennedy's walked on water. I didn't think that any of them walked on water.
                    There were a lot of prejudices against the Kennedy's, starting with the old man,
                    Joseph Kennedy. As I had worked in Cambridge and was somewhat politically
                    immersed in this whole crowd, I just...I think that Jack Kennedy did some
                    interesting things. He did, in fact, make some contributions. He made an impact
                    on Indochina, for example, in 1952, when he first became a Senator. However, I
                    viewed him in the late 1950's as basically an “absentee” Senator, a playboy who
                    was going to run for President. I really couldn't stand “Teddy” Kennedy [Senator
                    Edward Kennedy]. I found Teddy as downright obnoxious on television. I'm talking
                    about the way he came across. I really had no particular knowledge of “Bobby”
                    Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy, later Attorney General and also a Senator from New
                    York], because he didn't really grow up in Massachusetts. I subsequently ran
                    into Bobby Kennedy in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I was very unhappy that the Republicans had lost [the 1960 presidential
                    elections]. At the time of Kennedy's inauguration in January, 1961, I was living
                    in the Capitol Hill area, on East Capitol St., seven blocks from the Capitol.
                    The night before the inauguration there was a major snowstorm. It took four
                    hours to go from Arlington Towers [where the Foreign Service Institute was then
                    located] to Capitol Hill. About one inch of snow had fallen, but the Washington
                    area with all of the stranded vehicles, looked like Napoleon's retreat from
                    Moscow. They got the 3rd Infantry Regiment out [the ceremonial detachment at Ft.
                    McNair] with shovels to clean off Pennsylvania Avenue for the inaugural parade
                    [on January 20, 1961] because Washington had no snowplows.</p>
                <p>Everybody was running around. We went out that night, “bar hopping,” and so
                    forth. The Democrats were in town, looking for jobs. PT-109 must have been as
                    big as the cruiser USS BOSTON...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PT-109 was the Patrol Torpedo Boat which John Kennedy had
                        commanded during World War II and which was sunk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: PT-109 must have had a crew as large as a cruiser because there were so
                    many people going around, saying that they had served with Kennedy. It was kind
                    of a fun evening when this major catastrophe, the snowstorm, hit Washington. But
                    on January 20, I was so unhappy that I got into my car and drove to Boston. I
                    wasn't going to be present when “that man” was sworn in as President. This was
                    kind of stupid, because the snow was worse up in Boston.</p>
                <p>At that time—I guess it still exists—there was a junior diplomats organization in
                    Washington, organized by young people in the Department of State and including
                    younger officers in the Washington Diplomatic Corps. There were social events,
                    such as a reception on July 4. I was sharing a row house in the Capitol Hill
                    area with a group of other Foreign Service Officers, including Bob Blackburn. I
                    don't know if you know him. When you were in Naples, I think that he was the
                    Administrative Counselor in Rome.</p>
                <p>I've known him for a long time. He literally recruited me out of the A-100 course
                    [at the Foreign Service Institute] as a tenant in his row house. I lived there
                    for my 33 months in Washington. Blackburn and I subsequently served in Cambodia
                    together. In fact, I stayed with him in Rome when I met you with the War College
                    group, which visited Italy. Anyhow, he was the guiding light of this row house
                    group. He had had a tour overseas and was back, studying Indonesian. He was one
                    of the movers and shakers in this young diplomats' organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>We had a reception at the house for the young diplomats. We invited Bobby and
                    Ethel Kennedy to come. He had just returned from his mission to Indonesia where
                    he had helped to “ease” the Dutch out of West Irian. He showed up. I may have
                    been “half in the bag” by the time he arrived. I greeted him at the door. I
                    said, “It's nice to meet another man from Massachusetts who has done well.” It
                    was a dumb comment. He gave me the coldest look. He had icy blue eyes. He was
                    evidently not amused by my greeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Kennedy administration within
                        the Department of State in the first few months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that John Kennedy once asked “Chip” [Charles E. Bohlen, a long
                    time Ambassador and Russian specialist in the Department] Bohlen, “What's wrong
                    with your Department of State?” Bohlen replied, “You are.” The junior officers
                    in the Department, of course, thought that President Kennedy was great. There
                    was this reputation that he had of great interest in all issues and of calling
                    up desk officers and asking them what was happening. I rather suspect that the
                    senior levels of the Department were being driven “nuts”—something like what we
                    see happening today [with President Clinton].</p>
                <p>At the same time, thinking back on that time period, I have the impression that
                    many people thought that President Kennedy was sort of the “choice” of the
                    Foreign Service. He was regarded as being better inclined toward the Foreign
                    Service, the Department, and foreign policy in general than Vice President Nixon
                    had been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seen in retrospect, Nixon was much more qualified than
                        Kennedy in the foreign affairs field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I suspect that both of them “hated” the bureaucracy and ended up by
                    “hating” the Foreign Service. I think that Nixon worked in the field of foreign
                    affairs for a longer time. Of course, he lived a whole lot longer than Kennedy
                    did. Maybe we can talk about that when we cover my Cambodian experience, because
                    of what President Nixon tried to do to the 50 or so Foreign Service Officers who
                    signed the petition against our Cambodian policy in 1970.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of junior officers, it was thought that Kennedy was kind
                    of “special,” despite the failure of the “Bay of Pigs” expedition and the Cuban
                    missile crisis of October 1962. At the time of the Cuban missile crisis, I was
                    in Washington at “ground zero” thinking that World War III was about to
                    start.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I was almost recalled to active duty as an Army Reservist at the time of the
                    Berlin Crisis in 1961. I said to myself, “I can't believe that this is happening
                    to me, after all of these years of trying to decide about my career, and then
                    have my career derailed by the Berlin crisis.” I didn't have much of a “feel”
                    for what the senior officers in the Department felt about Kennedy. Of course,
                    the press was totally in Kennedy's pocket. They really were. They thought that
                    he could walk on water.</p>
                <p>If you were observing anything, you certainly got the feeling that the Kennedy
                    administration was really “screwing up.” He wanted to get involved in Laos, but
                    somebody talked him out of sending troops there. Obviously, there had been a
                    “screw up” on the Bay of Pigs. He had been roundly “chewed out” by Khrushchev in
                    the face to face meeting in Vienna. We discovered that there really hadn't been
                    a “missile gap” which Kennedy had talked about during the 1960 presidential
                    elections campaign. In fact, we were in pretty good shape from the defense point
                    of view. However, given our relative lack of sophistication, younger officers
                    believed that the Kennedy years were “Camelot,” with all of these bright, young
                    people in the White House. I think that the senior levels of the Foreign Service
                    were probably pretty frustrated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in IO during the whole time in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I left in late August, 1963, and arrived at my first post in Cameroon
                    in October, 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The capital of Cameroon was Douala, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yaounde was the capital. We had opened a Consulate in Douala in 1962. I
                    was the third officer to be assigned there. There wasn't even a Post Report. I
                    had to go to the library and find something in the “National Geographic” to find
                    out what Cameroon was all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to ask. Did the three years in Washington get you a
                        wife or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No. I came close. I had relationships with a couple of young women, one
                    of them a CIA analyst who had graduated from Fletcher [Fletcher School of Law
                    and Diplomacy at Tufts University]. But she was from Kentucky and was certainly
                    not interested in going to go to Africa. No, I think that she felt that she had
                    her own career and was not really interested in doing the Foreign Service spouse
                    thing.</p>
                <p>So I went to deepest, darkest Africa, without a wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out to Douala in 1963. This was the height of the
                        “romance” with Africa [in the Department of State]. It was thought that the
                        corps of specialists on Africa was going to be the leading edge of the
                        Department and that Africa was going to be the bright light of the world. It
                        was just a feeling. I am not denigrating anyone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You're right. That feeling was very much there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think this way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, I didn't particularly want to go to “Black Africa” [Africa South
                    of the Sahara]. In fact, I had asked to be a “Mediterranean Basin Specialist.”
                    This field of specialization didn't exist, of course, but it sounded all right
                    to me. Algeria was one of the most interesting places in the world at that time.
                    It was really the “hot issue.” France and the French language were also my
                    interest. I figured that there were lots of places where the French language was
                    used. It would be interesting to serve in some of those places. I said that I
                    really would like to serve in Algiers, if I could, for my first posting abroad.
                    I was taking an early morning French class with the Personnel Officer in the
                    Department for Africa. I kept telling him, “Don't forget, when my name comes up,
                    that I want to go to Tunis or Algiers or some place like that.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, he called me up in IO one day with laughter in his voice and said, “Guess
                    where you're going?” He said, “You're going to Douala.” I said, “What? What is
                    Douala?” I remember reaching for the Department phone book on my desk, because
                    there used to be a map in the back with all of the Foreign Service posts on it.
                    I wondered, “Where in the hell is Douala?” Douala wasn't even on the map. I
                    said, “You can't do this to me.” He really got a great laugh out of that. I
                    thought that my career had ended, before it started. I was somewhat depressed by
                    the prospect.</p>
                <p>I went to Cameroon by ship, via Europe, where I bought a Volkswagen “beetle”. I
                    drove it to Marseille, loaded it on the SS “General Mangin”, and took a 17-day
                    trip down the West coast of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went, did you get any briefing from the African
                        Bureau? Did it stick in your mind at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes, I did. But it didn't stick with me very much. Cameroon is an
                    interesting place, though, because an insurgency was going on at that time,
                    sponsored by the Chinese Communists, the Guineans, and Ghana. The insurgency was
                    led by what was called the UPC [Cameroonian People's Union]. This insurrection
                    had been going on since 1955. Cameroon (ex German Imperial colony of “Kamerun”)
                    had been a League of Nations then a UN Trust territory, with the French and
                    British as the administering powers. The reason that we had opened a Consulate
                    in Douala was that Cameroon was supposed to be an independent country. It really
                    wasn't independent. We thought that there might be commercial opportunities
                    there. The Consulate was supposed to handle consular affairs as well, but the
                    French had the country “sewed up” economically as tight as a drum. They weren't
                    about to let the Americans get in.</p>
                <p>The insurgency in Cameroon had been violent. It was kind of like what had gone on
                    in East Africa, with the “Mau Mau” movement. There were 17,000 casualties over
                    seven years. But the interesting thing was that few ever knew anything about it,
                    because the French kept the press out of there. They knew how to keep a “lock”
                    on things. And, of course, most of the attention at the time was in Algeria. The
                    guerrillas attacked the international airport at Douala and hacked a bunch of
                    French to death with machetes. This doesn't shock anybody nowadays, but in 1963
                    it caught your attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was a communist-Marxist led movement. Everything was in a state of
                    flux. West Cameroon, which had been under British control, had split in 1960
                    with half of the territory deciding, along tribal lines, to go with French
                    Cameroon, and the other half—the northern part of Cameroon—went with Nigeria.
                    Many of the tribes that were involved in this rebellion were along the West
                    Cameroon border. Great Britain assigned a regular army infantry battalion to
                    keep an eye on things. We had about a hundred Peace Corps volunteers in West
                    Cameroon in 1963 and a much smaller number in French Cameroon.</p>
                <p>So it was an interesting place. Ahmadou Adhijo, who was the President of
                    Cameroon, was a fairly stable individual. He was smart and competent. He ruled
                    for over 20 years—and quite sagely. It kind of went to pieces after he died. He
                    had not been as dictatorial or as nutty as Kwame Nkrumah or some of the other
                    African rulers of the period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there in Douala?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I was a vice-consul, the number two man at the Consulate. There were
                    four Americans at the post. There was a secretary and an administrative
                    assistant—both female. The Principal Officer was the Consul, and I was the
                    vice-consul. I replaced the man who actually opened the post.</p>
                <p>I didn't hit it off with the Principal Officer. The first year that I was there
                    was not a very rewarding experience. He was the kind of person who kept all of
                    the interesting work for himself. If a Peace Corps volunteer turned a jeep over
                    out in the bush, or had some other kind of accident, the Consul would hop in his
                    vehicle and go out to rescue him. I couldn't even write a letter to a
                    missionary, saying, “Your passport is about to expire,” without the Consul's
                    correcting it. So I ended up by counting the paper clips in the warehouse and
                    meeting the couriers, that sort of thing. I think that the Consul didn't have a
                    high opinion of my French language capability. He was himself married to a
                    French woman. I had come out of French language class and still felt a little
                    uncertain about using it. Although I thought that he had given me a fairly
                    decent efficiency report, my first abroad, it was only after I returned to the
                    Department and read the CONFIDENTIAL part of it, as they used to do, that I
                    realized that he had literally “cut my throat.” The DCM, who wrote the Reviewing
                    statement tried to soften it because he liked me. However, the Consul came down
                    with hepatitis, four months before he was due to be transferred and had to be
                    medically evacuated.</p>
                <p>Cameroon was being inspected at that time [by Foreign Service Inspectors]. The
                    chief inspector was a very highly regarded, senior Foreign Service Officer named
                    Randolph Kidder. His previous position had been that of Political Counselor in
                    the Embassy in Paris. He took a liking to me. and with the Department and the
                    Embassy wondering who was going to replace the Principal Officer in Douala until
                    the Consul's replacement arrived from Genoa. Inspector Kidder said, “Let
                    Antippas do the job. He's going to sink or swim. He'll either do it or not.”</p>
                <p>So the Embassy and the Department agreed to leave me in charge of the post and I
                    served as acting Principal Officer for four months. I think that I did well. As
                    I was on my own, I kind of “took off.” Of course, I worked very hard. I wrote an
                    analysis of the political parties of the West Cameroon, the first ever. But
                    because there was no secretary I had a Peace Corps girl I was dating type the
                    airgram for me. I also spent a hectic month helping search for an aircraft that
                    disappeared near Mount Cameroon in the process of being ferried to the former
                    Belgian Congo by the brother of the then Duke of Hamilton. The Duke was related
                    to the then British Prime Minister Douglas Home.</p>
                <p>Not the least of the Consulate's chores related to the fact that Douala was a
                    transit point for the U.S. diplomatic courier system in West Africa. The post
                    with the departure of the Consul was reduced to two American, Principal Officer
                    and Administrative Assistant. We had 13 couriers a week come to Douala—only one
                    during normal duty hours. So every other day I had to go to the airport in the
                    middle of the night, pick up the courier, and take him down, with all of his
                    “X-2” [ large size diplomatic pouch] bags.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The Congo was the hot area at the time—this was now 1964. I swear that Washington
                    must have been shipping ammunition to the Congo because those X-2 bags were very
                    heavy. It also went very hard for you if you missed a courier run. One day G.
                    Mennen Williams, or “Soapy” Williams [then Assistant Secretary of State for
                    African Affairs], came to Douala, flying out of the Congo. He was just
                    transiting Cameroon. A French friend who was UTA [Air Transport Union, a French
                    airline] manager...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By UTA, you mean the other...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The other French airline beside Air France. He called me up and said,
                    “There's a guy sitting out here, sleeping on a bench in the waiting room at the
                    airport. The manifest says that he's an Assistant Secretary of State named
                    Williams.” So I quickly called the Embassy, got the Ambassador on the phone, and
                    told him that Assistant Secretary Williams was in the waiting room at the
                    airport. The Ambassador said, “Go out there and tell him to hold on. I'm coming
                    down to see him.” I rushed out the door of the Consulate. When I got to the
                    airport, I saw Assistant Secretary Williams walking out to his plane, which had
                    just been called for departure. I introduced myself, said I was the Vice-Consul,
                    and said that the Ambassador would really like to talk to him. He smiled, was
                    very nice, but waved me away. That was 1964. Four years later, in 1968, when I
                    was in Saigon, “Soapy” was the Ambassador to the Philippines. He came to Vietnam
                    for a visit. This was three days before the bombing halt of early November,
                    1968, by which President Lyndon Johnson was trying to ensure that Hubert
                    Humphrey [the Democratic presidential candidate] would be elected.</p>
                <p>As the Saigon Embassy escort officer I took “Soapy” Williams all over Vietnam,
                    including a visit to “Yankee Station” [an area off the coast of South Vietnam
                    where U. S. Navy carriers conducting the air war against North Vietnam were
                    normally located]. He wanted to talk to the people who were bombing North
                    Vietnam. I reminded him of his visit to Douala and what a day he made for me
                    when I found out that he was sleeping on a bench and how the Ambassador was
                    unhappy that I hadn't been able to persuade him stay. “Soapy” was amused by the
                    story.</p>
                <p>In any event it was really delightful to be a Principal Officer and I thought the
                    best job in the Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Cameroonian Government, a French Government,
                        or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There was a Cameroonian Government. The French were still dominant, for
                    the most part. There were only three career Consulates in Douala: the French,
                    who, under the Cameroonian constitution, were automatically deans of the
                    Diplomatic and Consular Corps, no matter how long the incumbent French diplomats
                    had been there; the Swiss; and ourselves. There was a gaggle of honorary
                    consulates. The French were influential because they were paying a good part of
                    the international aid bill. They had a lot of technical people there. They also
                    had a lot of “Peace Corps type” volunteers, who were doing their military
                    service as teachers. The French exercised an omnipresent influence with their
                    aid and technical advisors. The French Consul in Douala had been a local
                    “Prefect” before independence. But there was a Cameroonian Government.</p>

                <p>ANTIPPAS: Not all of that much. Mostly with the Provincial Governor in the French
                    Cameroons side. I spent more time over in West Cameroon than anything else
                    because there were more Americans over there. There were missionaries and...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: West Cameroon was part of Cameroon—is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. West Cameroon was a long strip of British administered territory
                    that stretched from the Bight of Biafra to Lake Chad in the North. In 1960 it
                    was split into northern and southern parts. The northern part went to Nigeria.
                    The southern part elected to be federated with French Cameroon. The split went
                    along tribal lines. The Vice President of Cameroon at the time was a West
                    Cameroonian named John Ngu Foncha. He spoke no French but was the Vice President
                    of the Federated Republic of Cameroon. Given the fact that the insurrection was
                    taking place in that part of the country and that we had all of these Peace
                    Corps volunteers and a little bit of commercial activity, I spent a fair amount
                    of time in West Cameroon.</p>

                <p>ANTIPPAS: There were no particular problems. They were quite accommodating. There
                    was no particular difficulty. The one contact that comes to mind is when the AID
                    mission in Yaounde asked me to represent them in the presentation of some
                    chemicals to fight cocoa plant blight.It became quite clear that, first, there
                    were very few commercial Americans in the area. Oil exploration was just
                    beginning at that time offshore in the Bight of Biafra, where major strikes were
                    made afterwards. I can remember that, apart from the Peace Corps volunteers and
                    a couple of guys from Texas or Louisiana who were doing seismic soundings in
                    preparation for oil prospecting, there was very little American commercial
                    activity. I left the post when the new Principal Officer came, because the
                    Department decided to reduce the size of the post to two Americans, rather than
                    four Americans, as had been the case previously. I was transferred to the
                    Embassy in Bangui [Central African Republic].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Peace Corps volunteers? What were they
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: They were mostly teaching English.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was really the first generation of Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here were Peace Corps volunteers teaching English in what
                        had been virtually a private hunting ground of the French. I'm surprised
                        that there was any call for English.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There was interest in English. There was a much smaller number of Peace
                    Corps volunteers, as I recall it, in the former French Cameroon than there was
                    in what had been British controlled West Cameroon. West Cameroon was somewhat
                    backward in comparison to the French Cameroons. The British hadn't done much for
                    it, and the French didn't do anything for it, either. I remember that when the
                    West Cameroons affiliated itself with the French side they lost Commonwealth
                    preferences for banana exports which really hurt. In any event, I think that the
                    Peace Corps volunteers were accepted all right. They didn't do too badly. In the
                    West Cameroons they were mostly involved in village development projects;
                    digging wells and the like.</p>
                <p>My basic impression of the Peace Corps volunteers was that a lot of them “went
                    native” very quickly. This was kind of the beginning of the “flower children”
                    generation anyway. This was the early generation of the 1960's. My eyes went
                    very wide at some of the things these people did. The Peace Corps had its own
                    administration. They had an in-country Director with whom we worked very closely
                    and had very cordial relations. They had to watch out for the volunteers. But
                    nevertheless, if something happened, the consular officers had a certain
                    responsibility toward them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say, “going native,” I think it's
                        interesting...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I meant that some were living with native women. Some volunteers, I
                    recall, lived in local huts—not, exactly, Peace Corps issue housing. They really
                    got into the culture, if you could call it that. These were fairly primitive
                    living quarters. Some of the locations were pretty limited. I dated a Peace
                    Corps volunteer, who lived 80 miles away in what was a French aluminum foundry
                    town at Edea. There were several rubber plantations in the area as well some
                    that belonged to the Terres Rouges Company. There was a waterfall there at Edea,
                    so the French had built a power plant and a smelter. They brought bauxite from
                    Guinea to Cameroon. They trucked the bauxite 80 miles into the interior, smelted
                    it, and sent the ingots to Louisiana in the United States. It's interesting in
                    terms of mercantilist theory.</p>
                <p>I used to have to drive through this rain forest, 80 miles one way, for a date in
                    Edea. It made it very interesting. What you do when you're young and single!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to the Central African Republic [CAR], where

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: 1965. I spent a year at each post [Douala and Bangui]. The CAR was much
                    smaller in scope than the Cameroons even though it had a land area the size of
                    Europe. The city of Bangui had a population of only 45,000 people at that time,
                    out of a total population in the whole country of about one million.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, what was the political situation
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The President of the country was a civilian named David Dacko. He was
                    later thrown out by the Army chief, Colonel Bokassa, who proclaimed himself
                    Emperor and spent the country's entire GNP for a year on his “coronation”. The
                    Central African Republic is situated just North of the then Republic of the
                    Congo [now Zaire], which, at that time, dominated everything that was going on
                    in the region. French power was very much “present.” The French had a military
                    force stationed on the tri-border area of Chad, Cameroon, and the Central
                    African Republic. They had a military post there at which what was called an
                    “intervention force” was stationed. It was smaller than a division—probably a
                    regiment or brigade of paratroopers. I think that they actually intervened in
                    Gabon, when a coup d'etat was attempted there. They were very evidently going to
                    intervene wherever French interests dictated and to secure those countries whose
                    administrations were basically friendly to France.</p>
                <p>There were several insurrections going on. The Katanga area [Eastern Congo, now
                    Eastern Zaire] was of the greatest interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the southern Congo province of Katanga, which
                        split away from the central Congolese Government. There were a lot of
                        mercenaries there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There were considerable mineral resources there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The major company was the Union Miniere du Haut Katanga
                        [Mining Union of Upper Katanga].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The union leader there, I think, subsequently became the president of
                    the Congo. What was his name? I can picture him but I can't remember his name.
                    [Moise Tshombe]</p>
                <p>Anyhow, there were some other, “half-baked” insurrections going on. One of them
                    was called the “Simba Rebellion.” They were a real bunch of “crazies” up in the
                    northern part of the Congo. They captured Stanleyville and held our Consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Michael Hoyt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: At least one American missionary was killed during the Belgian-American
                    rescue operation [of Stanleyville].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The operation was called “Dragon Rouge” [Red Dragon].</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. There was a little chore I had to do from time to time in this
                    connection. Our PAO [Public Affairs Officer] had his own airplane in Bangui. So
                    we used to fly around the country. We went up to a crossing point 300-400 miles
                    into the interior on the river that forms the border between the CAR and the
                    Congo. This was apparently a traditional crossing point of the main North-South
                    road from the Sudan. All of the canoes had been brought over to the CAR side and
                    chained up there to keep the “Simbas” from crossing over and doing any more
                    marauding. I went up there to try to pick up intelligence—to see if any “line
                    crossers” could tell us anything about what the Simbas were doing to our people,
                    who were still under house arrest.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>One of the other chores I had in Bangui was to go down to the river [Ubangi
                    River] every day and look for American bodies in the river. Bodies were floating
                    down the river. Some of them would wash up in the shallows in downtown Bangui.
                    The situation was kind of like Rwanda today, though not as bad. I have pictures
                    at home of bodies floating in the river. One of the things which one learns is
                    that the skin pigmentation of black people, after being immersed in water for a
                    time, turns white. So the bodies all looked like Caucasians, floating in the
                    river, until you realized that, in fact, they weren't. Anyway, this was a pretty
                    grisly job.</p>
                <p>I had originally been assigned to shift to Embassy Nouakchott, Niger from Douala.
                    But this was changed to Bangui as Third Secretary and Vice-Consul, because the
                    incumbent Administrative Officer had to have a hernia operation. He went up to
                    Wheelus Air Force Base in Libya, where there was an Air Force hospital. So I was
                    assigned to Bangui as Administrative Officer, Consul and Economic/Commercial
                    Officer. I had at least three “hats” to wear. Claude “Tony” Ross was Ambassador.
                    He was at age 43, the youngest career Foreign Service Officer to become
                    Ambassador. Ed Brennan was DCM. Charlie Bray, who was then Political Officer,
                    subsequently became spokesman for the Department and Ambassador to Senegal. In
                    addition to a Public Affairs Officer (PAO) who was a USIS officer, The Military
                    Attach�, as I recall, was also actually resident in Chad, at Fort Lamy [now
                    called N'Djamena]. There was no Peace Corps contingent but we did have a couple
                    of “SeaBees” doing some kind of construction work in the Western part of the
                    country. We would stop with them if we drove the 800 miles to Cameroon. It was a
                    very small, fairly close knit Embassy and diplomatic community. I was in Bangui
                    when De Gaulle recognized Red China. The CAR was very close to De Gaulle. The
                    Ubangi Shari, as the territory was called before independence, had been one of
                    the first French African territories to declare for the Free French in 1940. So
                    it had a place very close to De Gaulle's heart. He never forgot those African
                    countries that had supported him at that time—particularly the CAR and
                    Cameroon.</p>
                <p>Consequently, De Gaulle gave them an extra dollop of aid every year. When France
                    [under De Gaulle] recognized Red China in 1964, the CAR, and all of the other
                    former French territories also recognized the PRC. The CAR kicked out the
                    Ambassador of the Republic of China, who, of course, was fairly close to us.
                    Then the Red Chinese and the Russians came in, which sort of changed the local
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll stop this at this point and will pick up with more
                        details about what our interests in the CAR were, more about the “Simba”
                        business and how that worked out, and how the Embassy in Bangui was run and
                        how it dealt with the CAR.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 5, 1994. Andy, while you were there in the
                        CAR, how did the “Simba” business finally wind down? Or did it wind down
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It did. My memory is not all of that exact on this. Of course, the CAR
                    is on the northern border of the then Congo-Kinshasa [now Zaire]. The capital,
                    Kinshasa, was called Leopoldville in those days.</p>
                <p>As I recall, the “Simbas” were really a fragmented kind of opposition group, led
                    by witch doctors, in effect. They were probably high on drugs, for all I know.
                    In any event, they managed to take over a certain amount of territory in the
                    northern part of the Congo, including the major town of Stanleyville, capturing
                    our Consulate and Consulate staff. They were held as hostages in the town, along
                    with a number of other American missionaries and other Europeans. It was quite a
                    tense time, because we didn't know whether they would be killed if we tried to
                    go in and liberate them. Eventually the U.S. Force ferried in Belgian
                    paratroopers who cleared the area. I recall the one American casualty, a
                    missionary who was machine gunned trying to scale a fence.</p>
                <p>I had several jobs in the Embassy in Bangui. These were not particularly onerous
                    in a small country like the CAR, which only had a population of about one
                    million. At one point I had to be Administrative Officer, GSO, Consul, and
                    Economic Officer. As one of my jobs was the protection of American citizens. We
                    had a lot of missionaries in the CAR. There were also Americans prospecting for
                    diamonds out in the western part of the CAR, toward the border with the
                    Congo-Brazzaville, as it was called [to distinguish it from the
                    Congo-Leopoldville]. During the “Simba” affair I had made a number of contacts.
                    There was a large number of Greeks in the former French Equatorial Africa in
                    those days. One of them that I met was a coffee planter, who admitted that he
                    had run away from conscription during World War II. He had good contacts over in
                    Congo-Leopoldville. I used to go up to the crossing point, which I mentioned
                    before, 300-400 miles up the river from Bangui. I would fly up there on the
                    PAO's plane from time to time and we would look around and try to pick up
                    tidbits of information. We didn't have a CIA “Station” in the CAR at that
                    time—didn't get one until the Chinese Communists and the Russians arrived in
                    1964. I would go up there and try to find out what was going on. The CAR
                    authorities were obviously scared to death that the “Simbas” might try to cross
                    the river there, which was very broad. This Greek coffee planter had contacts
                    with native “line crossers”—people who would go across the river and pick up
                    information. I would talk with him and get some idea of what the situation
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the government there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was relatively easy. The dress was informal.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The Israelis had a fairly active Embassy in the CAR in those days. Their
                    Ambassador had been an Army general. Their aid mission was quite active. The
                    Israeli Ambassador had persuaded the President of the CAR to go into the “summer
                    uniform” of a short sleeve shirt and no tie and stop “doing the French thing” of
                    wearing a dark suit and a tie. This made an awful lot of sense. This was the
                    first time I ever experienced that.</p>
                <p>Relations with the CAR Government were not much of a problem. We didn't have that
                    many issues to deal with. The biggest economic interest we had involved diamond
                    mining and some timber exploitation. The CAR didn't export very much else at
                    that time except hardwood timber. The French were the paramount economic power,
                    as they had been in Cameroon. They were very anxious to keep the Americans
                    out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tony Ross. How did you find him as an Ambassador?</hi>

                <p>ANTIPPAS: A great guy. A very nice guy. He had been a Middle Eastern specialist,
                    you know. As a young officer, he had served in Egypt, where he did well during
                    the 1956 Arab-Israeli War, I think. He had a Greek-American wife, so we got
                    along very nicely. He was very sharp, very professional. He went on to be
                    Ambassador to Haiti, and he was Deputy Assistant Secretary in the African
                    Bureau. I think that he finally retired when Secretary of State Kissinger
                    appointed someone else to be Assistant Secretary of State for African
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>Ed Brennan [DCM in Bangui] was my immediate superior. I remember that I lived
                    with him and his family in his house, until I got my own place in Bangui.</p>
                <p>You might be interested in hearing how the “Agency” [CIA] came to town and how
                    such things worked at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: As I said, the Agency had no particular interest in the CAR. I think
                    that they had a lot of interest in the Congo-Leopoldville [now Zaire] and what
                    was going on there. They were supporting Mobutu even at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>When De Gaulle recognized Red China in 1964, all of the former French colonies in
                    Africa followed suit. They “threw out” the representative of the Republic of
                    China [ROC] on Taiwan. I remember that when the ROC Ambassador had to leave the
                    CAR suddenly—almost overnight—we tried to “secure” his property. In fact, I was
                    given the task of taking his sedan and driving it to Cameroon to keep it from
                    being turned over to the Red Chinese. I remember that Ed Brennan told me to “hot
                    foot” it out of town and get it to Cameroon. That was 800 miles away over
                    basically savanna or desert kind of country. I did it. I beat it almost out of
                    the CAR. But before I could get out of the country, I stopped off at the
                    location where we had the “SeaBees” [U. S. Navy Construction Battalion]. I
                    stopped overnight with them. Charley Bray [Political Officer] chased after me in
                    another Embassy vehicle, caught up with me, and said, “You've got to turn
                    around. We've changed our minds.” It apparently not in accordance with protocol
                    to take ROC Embassy property and try to keep it from the incoming, PRC [People's
                    Republic of China] Embassy. It would embarrass the CAR Government. So I drove
                    back.</p>
                <p>When the Red Chinese came in, we were very “uptight.” Relations with them were
                    not good. The Vietnam War was beginning to heat up at that time. We studiously
                    ignored each other at social functions. The Red Chinese came in, and the
                    Russians weren't far behind. They had earlier recognized all of these countries.
                    They just didn't have resident ambassadors in them. Later, they set up resident
                    embassies there.</p>
                <p>When the Russians showed up, the Agency showed up, in the form of a
                    “representative from the Department of Commerce in Washington.” He came in with
                    a lot of luggage. The Russians had decided to take a house, a former American
                    missionary house which was two houses over from my house, in a very nice part of
                    town. The “Commerce Department representative” came to live in my house. Of
                    course, I was a bachelor, and this was no problem. However, they had managed to
                    put some “bugs” in the walls of the house that was being refurbished for the
                    Russians. The Russians were not the only ones planting “bugs” in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Using the technology of the times— the Agency guy had two large, Samsonite
                    suitcases—he would sit in one of my bedrooms. At night he would fire a
                    “thunderbolt” and turn on the “bugs.” He would leave them on for a while, trying
                    to listen while taping the conversations. He had to listen to all of this in
                    real time. Then he would take all of the equipment away when my house boy was
                    around. So he spent day and night in my house, listening to tapes. I remember
                    one time that we had a fierce rain storm, with bolts of lightning hitting around
                    the neighborhood. One lightning bolt turned on the “bugs” inside the house. I
                    remember how nervous he was. If the Russians “swept” their house electronically,
                    from time to time, as we would do, they might find the “bugs.” He was firing
                    “thunderbolts” from his equipment, trying to turn the “bugs” off. He told me
                    that most of the time the Russians had radios playing, which was the technique
                    that you use to try to foil listening devices. So we apparently couldn't pick up
                    much. The first resident agent spoke Russian as well as French. We subsequently
                    served in Vietnam at the same time. Anyway, the Russians, the Chinese, and the
                    Americans kind of “peered” at each other, out there in the middle of nowhere in
                    Central Africa. I only stayed in Bangui for a year. Charley Whitehouse [later
                    Ambassador to Laos and Thailand] was the Personnel Officer for Africa. He wrote
                    me a letter and asked me if I would be willing to go to work for the AID program
                    in Vietnam, which was just then building up [1965]. The Department was assigning
                    Foreign Service Officers to the “Office of Civil Operations” (OCO). I remember
                    writing back and saying: “Hell, no.” I'd been shot at in Korea and had just
                    spent two years in the jungles of Central Africa. I didn't want to go to some
                    place where I'd be shot at and also be in a jungle. He wrote back and said that
                    the Department wanted to do right by those of us who had served in the hardship
                    posts, so it was decided to send me to Japan. That was how I got my assignment
                    to the Consulate General in Kobe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1965 to 1967. What were you doing in
                        Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I was actually sent to be the Administrative Officer. However, the
                    Consul General was John Stegmaier, a senior Foreign Service Officer, who had
                    been in Japan forever. I sometimes thought that he had forgotten whom he
                    represented, the U. S. or the Japanese. Mrs. Stegmaier was even worse. Her
                    family had been missionaries in Japan for generations. She spoke better Japanese
                    than the Japanese. Anyway, it was decided that I would be a Visa Officer and
                    Vice Consul. John Coffey, who had been in charge of the Consular Section, would
                    also be the Administrative Officer. So I basically did consular work for two
                    years. Eventually, when John Stegmaier left, I was made chief of the Consular
                    Section. Kobe was good to me. I received two, back to back promotions in Kobe
                    and found a wife.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The Consulate in Kobe was basically a “visa mill,” but those were the days when
                    vice consuls signed every visa, before we had plates with signatures on them. I
                    remember that in one year I signed 13,000 visas by hand. That was a big workload
                    in those days. I don't know what it would be now—maybe half a million. We have a
                    visa waiver with Japan now. During my time the Consulate was “split.” The
                    Consular Section was in the Consulate building in the compound that we had in
                    Kobe. The CG and the Commercial section were in Osaka.</p>
                <p>This shows you how the old Foreign Service worked. We had had a Consulate in Kobe
                    since the “opening” of Japan [in 1854]. It's a wonderful town—the most
                    Westernized town in Japan, up until the 1960's, I think. We had a Consul General
                    in 1958 who decided that the Consulate would be in Kobe, because he thought that
                    Kobe was a much more pleasant town. In point of fact, most of the work in the
                    office was in Osaka, which is where the commercial center of gravity was. The
                    Department built this compound—the office was an architectural award winning
                    structure—in Kobe, along with an apartment building providing housing for most
                    of the American staff. But, as I say, most of the work was over in Osaka, so
                    another building was provided in Osaka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far away was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: 25 miles away to the North East. Osaka then had a population of four
                    million people. Kobe had one million. Commuting was really something. Talk about
                    “mob scenes” at the trains. Try riding the subway in Osaka in August—or in
                    winter, for that matter. So I spent one year in Osaka and one year in Kobe.</p>
                <p>Eventually, another Consul General decided that everyone should move over to
                    Osaka. Now, I think, they've decided to compromise, since the Consul General's
                    residence was in Nishinomiya, which is halfway between the two. We've now built
                    an office building in Nishinomiya. If you have work to do down at the port, you
                    go in one direction. If you have work to do in Osaka, you go the other way. The
                    train service is excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how the Japanese felt about us at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. It's interesting that you say that, because it depended on the
                    turn of the generations. I remember that the American impact, the American
                    occupation of Japan, was very strong after World War II. Remember that, first of
                    all, I was a consular officer. I was involved in protecting American citizens. I
                    remember a senior police officer calling me up at 4:00 AM one day to say that
                    they had some guy in jail for some reason or other. I said, “Fine, I'll be down
                    there first thing in the morning.” He replied, “Oh, you must come now, because
                    under SCAP [Supreme Command, Allied Powers—the command headed by General
                    MacArthur] rules we must inform you immediately upon the arrest of your
                    citizens. You must come immediately.” In the 1940's and 1950's, SCAP meant
                    MacArthur. I remember getting up and going down to the jail, because they took
                    it so seriously. There are countries, including the United States, which would
                    let weeks go by before the police informed a foreign Embassy or Consulate that
                    they were detaining one of their nationals. Who was I to refuse the police
                    officer's request? But at that time the people in authority still remembered the
                    American occupation, which had been over for about 13 years, at that point. The
                    occupation ended in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember. I was there. I stopped occupying Japan and
                        started protecting it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That's right. But there were relationships established, and we were
                    still very much a powerful influence in that country, although there were lots
                    of pro-Communist, anti-war demonstrations. If you haven't been in a Japanese
                    demonstration, you really haven't seen anything. Until you see 100,000 people
                    show up for a demonstration, snake dancing down the street, linking arms and
                    chanting, with police five ranks deep in front of your office building, with
                    water cannon and teargas to turn people back, you really haven't lived. And you
                    know that they're looking for you.</p>
                <p>I remember one time in Kobe. I was in the office at lunchtime. pro-Communist
                    demonstrators showed up, walked into the office, and started reading a communist
                    manifesto—in Japanese, of course—at the top of their lungs. I remember how
                    absolutely infuriated and humiliated I felt at these guys. I just went into my
                    office and closed the door. What else could you do? When they tried that the
                    second time, we locked the door on them and wouldn't let them in the building.
                    They would always come at lunchtime. They complained bitterly to our local
                    employees that they worked at the post office. They said, “We do this on our
                    lunch hour.” I felt, “Well, screw you. I don't want you in my office.” I've got
                    slides of these demonstrations, taken from inside the building. It was really
                    something to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was it that in the course of these demonstrations—and
                        I did not serve there at that time—no buildings were burned down, and so
                        forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No. They were very careful about property damage. I recall that they
                    painted graffiti on the office wall of this prize-winning building, which is
                    very much in the Japanese style. The wall was made of cinder block—lava type
                    rock. It was very porous, and we had a hell of a time getting those red-painted
                    slogans off the wall. But there was no real property damage. They didn't burn
                    vehicles or hurt anybody. Still, 100,000 people! After you get past 10,000,
                    chanting anti-American slogans, what difference does it make? One of the things
                    that we had in that area, just North of Kobe, was a large, aircraft repair
                    plant. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps used to bring their aircraft there from
                    Vietnam for refurbishing. It was an aircraft “rebuild” facility. I can't
                    remember the name of the place. We had a constant stream of Marine Corps and
                    Navy pilots coming through. This was in 1965-66 at the height of the Vietnam
                    War. The pilots would come up to collect the airplanes.</p>
                <p>I heard a lot about the Vietnam War from these pilots who were flying on missions
                    against the communists and telling us what it was like to be on the receiving
                    end of a SAM missile [Surface to Air Missile], which they called “flying
                    telephone poles.” They said that you could actually see these things coming up
                    at you. Several of my friends who were serving in the Army in Vietnam had come
                    up to Kobe for R&amp;R [Rest and Recreation] also described what was going on.
                    That's one of the reasons why I volunteered to go to Vietnam, I got so
                    interested in these stories that they were telling me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that your Consul General was an old Japanese
                        hand. Did you get any feel about Japanese hands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. I really felt that those people were afflicted by a serious case
                    of “clientitis.” They had great empathy with the Japanese. Now, I'm a great
                    admirer of the Japanese. If you've lived there, you can't fail to admire the
                    country. It's a society that functions. It works, in every sense of that word.
                    They are very special people. When you're a language officer and really become
                    enamored of the country, you tend to see things from the Japanese perspective. I
                    was not a language officer, although I was offered language training in a
                    two-year program in Yokohama. As much as I liked Japan, I didn't particularly
                    want to spend a third of my career in one place.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking, “Whom do these language officers represent? Do they
                    represent the United States or Japan?” Because everything that I was hearing was
                    pro-Japanese. Obviously, the problem was not very severe at that time. Japan was
                    really beginning to “take off” at that time in the mid-1960's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about economic affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. I'm talking in economic terms. That was the beginning of the
                    electronic revolution. Transistors, for example, were just then becoming “the”
                    thing. I remember buying stock in Texas Instruments in those days. But not
                    everybody was so affected. I remember a Commercial Officer, named Charles Duffy,
                    who was married to a Japanese. He could be very critical of the Japanese—but
                    that's because he was married to a Japanese and really had a special point of
                    view. Her grandfather was Shigeru Yoshida, I think, who was Prime Minister
                    during the 1950's. Duffy had a very good perspective on the Japanese. In fact,
                    he quit the Foreign Service and went to work for a merchant bank in Japan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way I'm surprised that you volunteered for
                        Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You know, I really had “had it” with jungles and things like that in
                    Africa. I had felt that Africa was not going to be very important in the great
                    scheme of things. As Vietnam began to heat up and it was beginning so in 1961, I
                    also thought in my mind that it was a mistake to be there. I vividly recalled
                    the French experience in Indochina. I had watched the French battalion leave
                    Korea for Vietnam where it was slaughtered in the Central Highlands in 1954. I
                    recalled the views of General Ridgway at the time who said we should avoid
                    getting into a war on mainland Asia. But, after two years in Japan I really was
                    kind of resting on my laurels. I had been promoted and was catching up with
                    colleagues of my age group. I felt that, because of the way the Foreign Service
                    was organized in those days, unless I obtained a political reporting job, my
                    career would be stymied in some fashion. I could go so far on the administrative
                    or consular side, but if I didn't get some political experience, I would not
                    really stand a chance of getting to a very senior position. I felt that one easy
                    way to get a political reporting job would be to go to Vietnam. Also, I was
                    becoming very interested in the problem—hearing these stories from these people
                    who were there. We were obviously on the “losing side” at that time. We had been
                    taking our “lumps” in Vietnam in 1965 and 1966. It wasn't until 1967 that we
                    began to think that maybe we might win this struggle.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I think that the other motivation was, quite bluntly, promotion. I thought that
                    everybody who went there was being promoted. I was very eager for promotion
                    because, as I told you in our first session, I was five years older than my
                    peers, because of my Army service and having gone to college after Army service.
                    It was stupid of me. I really shouldn't have worried about how fast I was
                    promoted. This is the guidance I later used to give my own junior officers. I
                    would say, “Don't worry about it. Take each job as it comes along and do the
                    very best you can, because the Foreign Service is always looking for good
                    people. If you're good, you'll get promoted.” In fact, I worried about it,
                    despite my own advice. I worried that I was 29 or 30 and was still an FSO-7
                    [under the old personnel system]. That was kind of dumb, but it motivated me
                    very much. I'd gotten these two, back to back promotions, so that by the time I
                    was through in Kobe, I was an FSO-5. I really wanted to make FSO-4 and thought
                    that if I did, I'd really be in a “launch” position for the rest of my career.
                    So, for a lot of reasons, I decided to volunteer for Vietnam. A number of cables
                    had come out from the Department, asking for volunteers for Vietnam.
                    Furthermore, John Coffey, who was very much an old Foreign Service hand, told me
                    in Kobe, “You really ought to volunteer and go to Vietnam because it will help
                    your career.” So, almost on a whim, I did.Then I went and told my wife. I had
                    just been married to Judith Blewett, a Canadian girl who was teaching in Kobe at
                    the International School. We married in early 1967 and returned to Kobe to
                    finish the tour—and I volunteered to go to Vietnam in the Spring. Well, I'll
                    tell you, she's never forgiven me for this—and this is 28 years later. She still
                    hasn't forgiven me, not because of Vietnam as such, but because she couldn't go.
                    At that time we weren't allowing dependents to be in Vietnam. She is a rather
                    gutsy and courageous woman. She would have done very well in Vietnam but she was
                    very angry that I did this without consulting her—and I was wrong. One of the
                    key mistakes of my life. The hassle I've had since then—aside from the fact that
                    we lost the war! I'll talk about that, down the road, because it was interesting
                    how things worked out for me in Indochina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that I volunteered in March, 1967. My tour in Kobe wasn't up
                    until October, 1967. I kind of hoped that I would go right away. The way it
                    would work, if my wife stayed in the United States, the tour was 18 months. If
                    she was “safe-havened” in a post near Vietnam, the tour was two years. My idea
                    was that she would stay in the U. S. for 18 months, I would be promoted, and we
                    would go on to greater glory. She didn't see it that way. She said, “I'm not
                    about to stay home.” So she decided to go to Bangkok for safe haven. Of course,
                    by that time she was also pregnant.</p>
                <p>I didn't get to go to Vietnam right away. In fact, I didn't get there for
                    something like eleven months, which was a very difficult time. I got to Saigon
                    just after the Tet offensive [of late January, 1968]. The whole scheme of things
                    had changed by February, 1968. In fact, my arrival was held up by the Tet
                    offensive. When did you go to Vietnam?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went there just a year later, in February, 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We were in Saigon together, in the Embassy. Of course, by the time I
                    had volunteered to go to Vietnam, I couldn't take it back. It would really have
                    hurt you, professionally, to have declined to go. At that time the Department
                    was ordering people to go. Whole junior officer classes were being ordered to
                    go, over their objections.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to the Political Section. I was supposed to replace an officer in
                    the Internal Unit of the Political Section. Then, when I got there, it was
                    decided that I would work in the External Unit. We had a 25-man Political
                    Section. These were Foreign Service Officers, not including any “spooks.” They
                    were all “straight leg” Foreign Service Officers. We had four or five guys that
                    covered the provinces, three guys in Political-Military Affairs, three in
                    External Affairs, five in Internal Affairs. We had one guy to cover the Upper
                    House of the National Assembly, another guy to cover the Lower House, we had two
                    guys covering the labor situation. One guy would cover the Buddhists. We were
                    very specialized.</p>
                <p>When I got there, I went to the External Unit. It was decided that I would cover
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, this is Tape 2, Side A. This is an interview with Andy
                        Antippas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was decided that my area of concern in the political section in
                    Saigon would be Cambodia, the French Community, and what we called the “More
                    Flags” project. The latter was President Lyndon Johnson's effort to get more
                    foreign countries to support the South Vietnamese Government. A lot of work
                    already had been done on this. I was a sort of “guardian” of the files but
                    periodically I would have to go out and visit the Philippine contingent
                    [PHILCAG], the Thai division, the Iranian hospital down in the [Mekong]
                    Delta—and things like that.</p>
                <p>In fact, I spent most of my time working on Cambodia. The “French Community”
                    really meant the rubber plantations. Many of the French left in Vietnam worked
                    for the rubber plantations. The rubber plantations were mostly located in Zones
                    “C” and “D” [areas North of Saigon where communist armed activity was very
                    active], as well as near the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, where they were being
                    used as sanctuaries by the Viet Cong. There was a sort of synergy between the
                    functions.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>My job required me to be chairman of the Mission Cambodia Committee. We were not
                    represented in Cambodia at that time. Prince Sihanouk broke diplomatic relations
                    with us, I guess, in about 1965, over border incidents with South Vietnam. We
                    didn't reestablish relations until 1969. Between 1965 and 1969 the Australians
                    were our “protecting power” in Phnom Penh [capital of Cambodia]. It's
                    interesting to recall that W. Randolph Kidder who was nominated to be Ambassador
                    to Cambodia in 1965, had been the Senior Inspector who inspected Douala in 1964.
                    He was the man who suggested that I be left in charge of the Consulate in Douala
                    for several months and be given a chance to “show my stuff.” After his
                    assignment as an inspector and his nomination as Ambassador to Cambodia, he went
                    to Cambodia, but Sihanouk never accepted his credentials. We closed the Embassy
                    down after that.</p>
                <p>During the time I served in Saigon the Johnson administration was trying very
                    hard to convince Sihanouk to do something about the North Vietnamese and Viet
                    Cong use of his territory. In 1968 we recorded over 200 border “incidents,”
                    involving firing from Cambodia into Vietnam or attacks by the North Vietnamese
                    which resulted in the loss of American lives on the border.</p>
                <p>Then there was the famous “understanding” of some of the missions sent by the
                    administration to Cambodia to try to talk Sihanouk into being more cooperative.
                    One of these missions was led by Eugene Black, who was then President of the
                    World Bank. He was accompanied by Philip Habib. During your time and mine in
                    Vietnam Phil Habib had been Political Counselor in Saigon. He was one of the
                    “legends” of the Foreign Service. Wasn't he your Ambassador in Seoul?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. My Ambassador was Dick Sneider.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Anyway, Phil Habib was the Foreign Service Officer who accompanied
                    Eugene Black to try to talk Sihanouk into being more cooperative. We wanted to
                    “beef up” the International Control Commission in Cambodia so that it could be
                    more effective, by offering them better communications equipment and maybe even
                    helicopters. For the benefit of people who don't know about the International
                    Control Commission [ICC], it was created as a result of the Geneva Accords of
                    1954. The Commission had four branch offices: one in North Vietnam, one in South
                    Vietnam, one in Laos, and one in Cambodia. They were each basically independent
                    of each other. The function of the Commissions was to make sure that the
                    provisions of the 1954 [Geneva] Accords were met. Most of the Commissions became
                    virtually moribund very quickly. The only one that seemed to function at all was
                    the one in Cambodia, because it suited Sihanouk's purpose to have an
                    international presence to try to protect Cambodia's territory.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The members of the Commission were the Poles, the Canadians, and the Indians.
                    India provided the Chairmen of the International Control Commissions. The Indian
                    who was Chairman in Cambodia at that time was V. V. Paranjpe, whom we all
                    thought was pro-communist. He actually went on to be Indian Ambassador to China.
                    He was a China “expert.”</p>
                <p>There was a constant battle. Sihanouk would take members of the ICC up to these
                    border sites and make a big “PR” thing, alleging that this was where the
                    Americans bombed Cambodia. Dead bodies would have lain out there for three or
                    four days until he could get the ICC to go up there. You want to talk about a
                    sight! The poor ICC representatives—they were all diplomats—were just trying to
                    do their jobs. They would look at these fly-ridden bodies. We had, of course,
                    good relations with the Canadians. The Canadians never really acted as our
                    “agents,” per se, because they were much more independent than that. But they
                    were basically our friends.</p>
                <p>One of my jobs was, from time to time, to brief the Canadian ICC representative,
                    At that time, a Canadian diplomat named Dick Gorham, who would come over from
                    Phnom Penh. I would take him to J-2 of MACV [the Intelligence Branch of the
                    Military Assistance Command, Vietnam] to get briefings about where the North
                    Vietnamese were in the border areas. If he could get down there, he might find
                    them. I remember telling him one time that in the “Parrot's Beak”
                    [West-Northwest of Saigon, where a salient of Cambodian territory jutted into
                    South Vietnam], “If you guys would go down here and go one kilometer further,
                    you'll find the Command Post of the First North Vietnamese Army Division.”</p>
                <p>I remember arranging for a firepower demonstration to be put on at a range in
                    Long Binh Province. We actually had the military fire various kinds of weapons
                    and then we took Dick Gorham out and showed him what the hole looked like [at
                    the impact points]. What the Cambodians would do was to go out, dig holes, put
                    pieces of rusty shrapnel in it, and say, “The Americans did that.” We wanted to
                    show the Canadians that, “If we shoot something, this is what it's going to look
                    like.” So the Canadian ICC representative became much more active.</p>
                <p>The other representatives on the ICC, the Poles and Indians, knew about this.
                    They assumed that the Canadian ICC representative was feeding us a great deal of
                    information. Dick Gorham went on to be an Under Secretary of External Affairs in
                    the Canadian Government in Ottawa. He hated the Indians. He'd been assigned to
                    India at one time and disliked the Indians. He couldn't stand Paranjpe, the
                    Indian ICC representative.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I remember that when we reopened our Embassy in Phnom Penh in 1969, my wife Judy
                    and I went over to visit Phnom Penh and Angkor Wat [Buddhist temple complex
                    Northwest of Phnom Penh]. We went to a party at the apartment of the Canadian
                    Military Attach� . Dick Gorham was there—the whole, small Western community was
                    there. Dick introduced me to Paranjpe while we were standing on the balcony of
                    this apartment block overlooking the Mekong River. My wife was there. Dick said,
                    “I want you to meet Mr. Andrew Antippas. He's an American Embassy Political
                    Officer in Saigon. He follows Cambodia, and this is his Canadian wife.” I saw
                    Paranjpe's eyes widen, and suddenly, everything fell into place for him. I
                    thought that he was going to do a “back flip” off the balcony when Dick said
                    that. Paranjpe was probably thinking, “The son of a bitch. He's been doing that
                    all of this time. He's been feeding intelligence [to the Americans].” Because
                    the Indians saw their job as covering up what the Viet Cong were doing in
                    Cambodia. Gorham's job was to try and get this information out, try to “expose”
                    it, try to do his job.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Cambodia was an interesting subject to follow. I wasn't, as I have
                    mentioned, particularly a believer in why we were in Vietnam, since my original
                    feeling about Vietnam had been the one I gave to Charley Whitehouse in 1965.
                    Since I had been in Korea and knew very well what the French had experienced in
                    Indochina—I had grown up during the Indochina War, after all—I doubted the
                    wisdom of what we were doing in Vietnam. But the fact of the matter was that we
                    were engaged, our armed forces were engaged, and we were taking a beating
                    through the communist use of neutral territory—in Laos and Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I really became kind of a believer in doing what we could, not so much to get
                    Cambodia into the war. Nobody believed that the Cambodians could do anything to
                    influence the war. One of the things that I knew was the condition of the
                    Cambodian Army. It was pathetic. It was a 30,000 man force, organized into 50
                    battalions scattered all over the country, mostly in “Beau Geste” type mud forts
                    [from the novel by the British author, P. C. Wren]. Those forts were simply
                    there to demonstrate Cambodian sovereignty, not to be able to defend anything.
                    They couldn't have. The North Vietnamese would pull up artillery units, next to
                    the Cambodian forts, and fire into Vietnam at our Special Forces camps. The U.
                    S. Air Force would come over and attempt to plaster the North Vietnamese, but
                    they would frequently hit and kill Cambodians.</p>
                <p>One of the things that Eugene Black and Phil Habib had gotten out of Sihanouk was
                    a commitment to receive intelligence information on the presence of Vietnamese
                    Communists on his territory. He indicated that he would accept such information.
                    One of the jobs I had, working with American Intelligence, was to prepare what
                    we called “packages” of information about the location of these base camps.
                    There were about half a dozen or a dozen, major communist base camps just inside
                    the Cambodian border, which we knew about, mostly through signal intercepts and
                    POW interrogations. We knew which units were in there and what they were doing.
                    Now and again we would have an American prisoner who would escape and tell us
                    what was in there.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>There's an interesting aside that I must tell you about, just to show what the
                    atmospherics were in Vietnam during that period. I would prepare these
                    “dossiers” and give them to the Australian Embassy in Saigon, which would send
                    them over to the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, which, in turn, would give
                    them to the Cambodian military. Sihanouk never acknowledged the receipt of any
                    of these “packages” of intelligence. We would know, again from signal
                    intercepts, that the Cambodians would send out a unit looking for these
                    Vietnamese Communist units. One time one of these Cambodian units got lost, up
                    in the Northeast “Tri-Border” [Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos] area, trying to find
                    one of these locations. It was really pathetic. But we knew that the Cambodians
                    were beginning to realize how much of their territory was being taken over by
                    the Vietnamese Communists. I think that what really “blew” their fuse on this
                    matter was that the Viet Cong started moving their families into these base
                    areas and farming the land. Then they started issuing tax receipts to the Viet
                    Cong families for the rice fields that they were farming and preventing
                    Cambodian District Officers from going into those areas. They would literally
                    seal off whole zones of these base areas.</p>
                <p>Well, anybody who knows the Cambodians will tell you that they really get upset
                    about Vietnamese encroachments on their land. All of the Mekong Delta, all of
                    the territory South of Saigon had been part of Cambodia, up until the 19th
                    century. It was only at the beginning of the 19th century that the Vietnamese,
                    moving slowly southward, as they have done over the past five centuries or so,
                    took over. The Cambodians called this area “Kampuchea Krom,” which means
                    “Southern Cambodia.” The ethnic Cambodians living in the Mekong Delta, many of
                    whom we recruited for our Special Forces, were called, “Khmer Krom,” which meant
                    “Southern Cambodians.” When they worked for the U. S. Special Forces, they were
                    called “KK,” or “Khmer Krom.”</p>
                <p>You can be sure that when the Cambodians finally realized that the Viet Cong
                    were, in fact, taking over their territory, they started getting upset. That's
                    what happened in 1970, when there was a...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General Lon Nol took over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, the overthrow of Sihanouk took place because there was a
                    demonstration in the provincial capital of Svay Rieng, which is the “Parrot's
                    Beak” area I mentioned before. It took place in late February or early March of
                    1970. I was not in Saigon. I was back here in Washington. There was a
                    demonstration in front of the provincial governor's house [in Svay Rieng],
                    protesting the Viet Cong takeover of their land. The “Tet” offensive [of 1968]
                    in Saigon had been launched from the “Parrot's Beak.” The southeastern tip of
                    the “Parrot's Beak” is only about 35 miles from Saigon.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Then there was a sympathy demonstration in Phnom Penh. That is where what
                    happened becomes questionable, because that was set up, we think, by Lon Nol's
                    younger brother, Lon Non, who was then a police official. Sihanouk was in France
                    on one of his periodic “rest or health cures” [in Mougins, near Nice]. There was
                    a sympathy demonstration which was followed by another sympathy demonstration
                    near the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Embassies. The Vietnamese communists had
                    two Embassies in Phnom Penh: the Viet Cong Embassy of the so-called “Provisional
                    Revolutionary Government” and the North Vietnamese Embassy. A mob sacked both
                    embassies. They literally threw everything in them outside, including over
                    $100,000 in U. S. currency, which they burned. We later found half burned
                    greenbacks. The Vietnamese were using this money to buy rice in Cambodia for
                    Vietnamese communist troops in the border areas. We used to have people take
                    pictures of bicycles carrying sacks of rice down to the Vietnamese-Cambodian
                    border area. There was a very sizeable cross-border trade going on, particularly
                    in the so-called “Parrot's Beak.”</p>
                <p>Following the riots in Phnom Penh, all hell broke loose. Sihanouk was very angry.
                    He made very threatening noises from France that he would “fix” those
                    responsible when he returned to Cambodia. Gen Lon Nol started negotiating with
                    the Vietnamese and said that he would reestablish the “status quo ante,” but the
                    Viet Cong troops in the border area had to leave Cambodian territory. In other
                    words, he would continue the arms and the rice trade, because the communists
                    were also shipping arms through Cambodia, along the “Ho Chi Minh Trail.”</p>
                <p>This was one of the great intelligence debates of the Vietnam War. Which was the
                    route the weapons and ammunition that the Vietnamese communists were using. The
                    trail or by sea on 100 ton trawlers? We knew the stuff was coming from China.
                    There was a way of calculating the expenditure of communist [artillery]
                    ammunition, just by the number of “booms” that went off. Every U. S. unit would
                    report how many [Vietnamese communist] shells were heard exploding on a given
                    day. Over time you could figure out how much ammunition they had on hand. This
                    would tell us what the resupply operation would have to be. The experts could
                    figure out how much was “in the pipeline.” The debate was whether the Viet Cong
                    were bringing the ammunition down by trucks along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, or on
                    these 100 ton steel hulled trawlers which go down the Vietnamese coast and then
                    up to Sihanoukville in Cambodia. The weapons and ammunition would be offloaded
                    and the supplies were then trucked up to the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, where
                    the communist units were stationed. A great internal debate went on in the
                    intelligence community in 1968 as the Johnson Administration was winding down.
                    The U.S. Navy under Admiral Elmo Zumwalt was convinced the stuff was coming down
                    by ship. It was very hard to prove since we had few agents inside Cambodia and
                    the top Cambodians were profiting from the arms and rice trade.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Near the end of the Johnson administration [October, 1968] William H. Bundy,
                    Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, the younger brother of
                    McGeorge Bundy who had been President Kennedy's National Security Adviser, came
                    to Saigon with a group of high-powered people from CIA. They conducted a debate
                    with MACV as to whether the Viet Cong ammunition was coming down the Ho Chi Minh
                    Trail or through Sihanoukville. The obvious, political implication for the
                    administration was that if the predominant amount of ammunition for III and IV
                    Corps in South Vietnam, more or less the southern half of South Vietnam, was
                    coming through Sihanoukville, that was something that we could do something
                    about. We could blockade Sihanoukville, overthrow Sihanouk, or do something
                    else. But if it was coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, nobody could stop that.
                    We had been trying to stop that for three or four years, without success. You
                    can see the political implications.</p>
                <p>This was at the end of the Johnson administration. We were going into the
                    elections of November, 1968. The last thing in the world that the Johnson
                    administration—or the Democratic Party—wanted to do was to expand the war into
                    Cambodia. Given my position in the Political Section in the Embassy in Saigon, I
                    sat in on the briefings for the Bundy party. I worked very closely with the
                    intelligence community representatives in following all of this. In fact, I
                    received an award from the U. S. Navy for the work I did in this effort to try
                    to identify where this Viet Cong ammunition was coming from.</p>
                <p>The Bundy group came to Saigon and asked to see all of the reports that we had
                    which asserted that the ammunition was being delivered in Sihanoukville, trucked
                    inland by General Lon Nol's people to the arms caches, and then distributed to
                    the Viet Cong military authorities. They went through this debate. I remember
                    that the decision was that there was no real “smoking gun” and, therefore, the
                    Johnson administration wasn't going to do anything about Cambodia.</p>
                <p>However, the following, Nixon administration was very much of the view that this
                    was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about it? What did the people who were
                        dealing with the problem in Saigon feel about it? Obviously, this had
                        political repercussions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I believed that Cambodian territory was being used to resupply the
                    Vietnamese communists. I can still remember the name of the [Cambodian] trucking
                    company used to bring the ammunition up [from Sihanoukville]. It was the Hak Lee
                    Trucking Company. We would find out that there was a Chinese [Communist] ship
                    off the Cambodian coast, going into Sihanoukville (now Kampong Som). So my job
                    was to rush over and ask the Australian Embassy in Saigon to send a message to
                    their Military Attach� in the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, stating that
                    there was a [Chinese] ship arriving in port and requesting him to “hot foot” it
                    down there to see what he could find out.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>He [the Australian Military Attach� ] would do that. He would jump in his car and
                    drive down Route 4 to Kampong Som, a four-hour drive from Phnom Penh. More often
                    than not, he would get there and meet the [Hak Lee] trucks coming back. I don't
                    know whether this incident was simply “alleged” or “apocryphal” or what, but
                    there was an assertion made that one case of guns had fallen off a truck, had
                    been found by people friendly to our side, and had been reported back. By virtue
                    of the serial number on an AK-47 [Chinese-made automatic rifle], they could tell
                    when that gun was manufactured in China and when it was delivered. Therefore, it
                    had to come by ship through Kampong Som.</p>
                <p>We had intelligence reports that said that the Hak Lee Trucking Company was
                    delivering these weapons to certain locations where the Viet Cong would take
                    them and distribute them. I think that the Australians believed this. Well,
                    nobody actually saw them do this. It was worth your life to watch them deliver
                    the weapons to the communists.</p>
                <p>We also had U-2 [very high-altitude, reconnaissance aircraft] flights over
                    Kampong Som. The port at Kampong Som had been built by the Russians. We built
                    Route 4 under our aid program in the 1950's [the so-called “Khmer-American
                    Friendship Highway”]. In fact, the project to build Route 4 was the source of
                    the story on the “Ugly American,” [from the book of the same name].</p>
                <p>The port at Kampong Som had no onshore loading and unloading cranes. There was no
                    equipment to offload ships at the docks. Ships had to offload cargo, using their
                    own, shipboard cargo booms. I remember that we would have these great debates.
                    The U-2 photos that we were taking could tell us how big the cargo hatches were.
                    Looking at the booms, you could tell how long it would take to unload that size
                    ship. You could then analyze this information. The experts would say that it
                    would take two days to unload whatever it was—10,000 tons of ammunition or
                    whatever it was that they were unloading. The communists always managed to do it
                    faster than that, because I think that they worked day and night. They'd get
                    this stuff on the trucks and get the trucks up Route 4 or Route 5 up into the
                    Vietnamese-Cambodian border area and deliver it.</p>
                <p>Anyway, there was a great debate about how this was done. I believed that this
                    was how it was happening, based on the expenditure of ammunition. Afterwards,
                    Gen Lon Nol's supporters kicked Sihanouk out and he became our “buddy.” I was at
                    the Embassy in Phnom Penh in 1970 as a Political Officer. We actually began to
                    confirm these earlier ammunition reports. We visited some of the arms caches
                    where these items had been kept.</p>
                <p>It's kind of funny because the arms caches we found in Grenada, when I
                    participated in the Grenada operation in 1983, looked just like the arms caches
                    I saw in Cambodia. This was because they were built by Russians—designed and
                    constructed by Russians or Russian trained people. The piles of weapons all
                    looked just like the ones in Cambodia. Talk about “deja vu all over again!”</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>So the Johnson administration was unable to “pass the ball” to [former Vice
                    President] Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic candidate for President, and the
                    Nixon administration came into office. During the Eugene Black and Phil Habib
                    visit to Cambodia in 1968 Sihanouk reportedly either said or indicated, using
                    our favorite Foreign Service term, “indicated,” that it was all right to bomb
                    communist base areas. However, Sihanouk was reported to have said, “But if you
                    kill Cambodians, I will scream like a stuck pig.” He reportedly said, “If you
                    kill Vietnamese, that's all right with us.” Since most of these base areas were
                    basically uninhabited, that's what was said. So, based on that, the Nixon
                    administration began the “secret bombing” of Cambodia in 1969. This campaign was
                    first “discovered” by William Beecher and surfaced in articles in the “Boston
                    Globe” in March, 1969.</p>
                <p>I believe that I was the first individual in the Embassy [in Saigon] to find out
                    about the “secret bombing” of Cambodia, because I had special access to MACV J-2
                    [intelligence] information. I used to wander into the office of the J-2 all the
                    time—particularly the photo interpretation side. You know, they were keeping
                    track of what the Vietnamese communists were doing, because you could tell a
                    great by photo interpretation.</p>
                <p>I remember an Airman Second Class acquaintance of mine who was a photo
                    interpretation specialist, in J-2. I wandered into his office, in a very secure
                    area, probably the most secure area in the whole building. People used to call
                    MACV headquarters, “Pentagon East.” This specialist said to me, “Do you want to
                    see something interesting? We tried to hit the CP [Command Post] of the First
                    North Vietnamese Army Division last night with B-52 strikes, and they were one
                    kilometer off the target.” He showed me the track, on a 1:50,000 scale map. It
                    was about five kilometers inside Cambodia. I said, “What? We just did what? We
                    bombed Cambodia?”</p>
                <p>I jumped in my car and sped back to the Embassy. I told the Deputy Ambassador—Sam
                    Berger, at that time—and I don't know who else I told. I don't know whether
                    Martin Herz was the Political Counselor at that time or not. Anyway, I was
                    telling Sam Berger. I could tell from the expression on his face that he didn't
                    know that this was authorized. So I was dismissed from his office.</p>
                <p>Then all hell broke loose. General Westmoreland was furious. I was never allowed
                    back in the photo interpretation lab after that. I wonder what happened to the
                    photo specialist? The affair caused an enormous “stink” in the U.S. when it was
                    discovered that we were bombing Cambodia. Of course, the explanation was that,
                    “Sihanouk said that it was OK to bomb Cambodian territory as long as we just
                    kill Vietnamese. If we kill Cambodians, “you'll hear about it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>Of course, the border incidents continued, and we continued to kill Cambodians.
                    It would happen, time and time again, that our forces would return fire into
                    Cambodia and would kill Cambodians. So I spent my time dealing with incidents
                    like this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for what the CIA was doing? They had
                        a huge operation in Vietnam, and you were in the Political Section. How did
                        they “interface” with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We had, of course, signal intercepts, which were a big part of their
                    function at that time. I had the impression that they didn't have much in the
                    way of “resident assets” in Cambodia. They had become notorious in Cambodia. The
                    CIA was alleged by the Cambodians to be implicated in an effort to overthrow
                    Sihanouk in 1959. This caused such a stir that the CIA subsequently kept a very
                    low posture. In fact, when Mansfield visited...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be Senator Mansfield.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes, Senator Mike Mansfield. He was quite an Asian expert, in his own
                    right, and was very friendly with Sihanouk. We reopened the Embassy [in Phnom
                    Penh] with Mike Reeves as charg� d'affaires in the summer of 1969. I remember
                    that I helped them a good deal in reestablishing the Embassy, with resources
                    from the Saigon side. Senator Mansfield arrived in Phnom Penh the week after
                    Mike Rives set up shop in the Royal Hotel. Mansfield spent a week in Phnom Penh.
                    He made a commitment to Sihanouk that there would be no CIA presence in
                    Cambodia. He said that there was none then and there would be none later. And
                    there wasn't—at least initially, when Sihanouk was still in power.</p>
                <p>So I think that the CIA really had very little in the way of assets in Cambodia.
                    Of course, the conventional wisdom in some quarters in Washington and elsewhere
                    was that the CIA overthrew Sihanouk, that it was at our behest that Gen Lon Nol'
                    supporters kicked Sihanouk out. I don't believe that this is true, based on my
                    own knowledge of what was going on in Cambodia. Obviously, there's a lot that I
                    didn't and wouldn't know. However, over time you learn the signs. I believe we
                    had decided that we were getting out of Vietnam, as a policy. The great debate
                    was simply over the rate of our withdrawal—how quickly we would get out. One of
                    the great criticisms of President Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger was
                    that it took them four years to get us out of Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I think that no one who had any knowledge of the capacity of the Cambodians to
                    fight had any illusions about their ability to defend themselves. They certainly
                    were in no position to take on any kind of Vietnamese at all. Overthrowing
                    Sihanouk would have set off a dynamic that no one could predict or control. More
                    than that, it's one thing politically to shoot into a so-called “neutral”
                    country, with the screams of outrage and diplomatic repercussions that would
                    follow. It's another thing to shoot into a communist country. If Cambodia went
                    communist, we would really have ended up with “egg on our faces” and would have
                    a situation like the one we had with North Vietnam and Communist China.</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that nobody would want to do this [i. e., overthrow Sihanouk]
                    because we were drawing down and getting out of Vietnam. Bombing Cambodia would
                    start off something that we couldn't predict. Secondly, if Cambodia did go
                    communist, that would be an even bigger problem. So it was better simply to keep
                    the status quo, until we could get out of Vietnam. I think that the argument
                    that we overthrew Sihanouk to widen the war and bring Cambodia in on our side of
                    the struggle might have been plausible in 1966 or even 1967. By 1968, it was too
                    late. We were on our way out. The American people had indicated very clearly
                    that they wanted to “get out” of Vietnam. So I have always taken the view that
                    Sihanouk was overthrown by Cambodians.</p>
                <p>[After we reopened our Embassy in Phnom Penh], I was one of the first Americans
                    to attend sessions of the Cambodian National Assembly. We had a very tiny
                    Embassy in Phnom Penh—only eight people—when all of this took place. I arrived
                    in Phnom Penh as a Political Officer in April [1970]. Three weeks after
                    Sihanouk's overthrow on March 9, 1979, the Vietnamese started attacking the
                    Cambodians. I didn't finish that story, which I began earlier.</p>
                <p>Lon Nol had started negotiating with the Vietnamese, saying that he would
                    reestablish the “status quo ante,” but Vietnamese [communist] troops had to get
                    out of Cambodian territory. They talked for a week or two, in March, 1970. Then
                    the Vietnamese evacuated all of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong Embassy
                    staff. The Chinese communists also evacuated their Embassy staff.</p>
                <p>Vietnamese troops in the “sanctuaries,” particularly up by the rubber plantation
                    country [where the “Terre Rouge” plantations were located], started attacking
                    Cambodian Police and Army posts in Kampong Cham province. A full three weeks
                    before we intervened, the Cambodians were being attacked and pushed back. By the
                    time the American “incursion” into Cambodia began on May 1, 1970, the Vietnamese
                    communists were 25 miles outside of Phnom Penh. When I got to Phnom Penh, on
                    April 27, 1970, the Vietnamese were literally outside of Phnom Penh. The first
                    CIA officer, John Stein, arrived in Phnom Penh two days before I did, on a
                    Special Mission aircraft. He was basically an Africa hand. He had no Indochina
                    background whatsoever. That was sort of a tip of the hat to Sihanouk's fear of
                    the return of CIA people with Indochina experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>At the time I was sent to Phnom Penh, Tom Corcoran was Country Director for
                    Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. He said, when he sent me to Phnom Penh, “You should
                    know that Mike Rives doesn't want you. Nothing personal, he doesn't want a
                    bigger staff. But when U. Alexis Johnson, [Under Secretary of State for
                    Political Affairs], signs this telegram, you're going out there.” He said, “I
                    want you to report more than what's in the newspapers. Find out what the hell's
                    going on there.” I did that.</p>
                <p>The Cambodian National Assembly overthrew Sihanouk in 1970. It approved a
                    resolution that said that Sihanouk, in fact, had endangered the well being of
                    the state by collaboration with the communists. It was the National Assembly
                    which had approved the constitution which made Sihanouk “head of state for
                    life.” So since they made the constitution, they could unmake it, and they threw
                    him out.</p>
                <p>I went to the National Assembly and started talking (in French) to the members.
                    During the two years that I was a Political Officer in Phnom Penh the National
                    Assembly was my “beat.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little more about Saigon before you do that.
                        You mentioned something about a story concerning a prisoner escaping.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Right. We had very little information about the communist “base areas”
                    in Cambodia. We had the case of an American soldier who had been captured up in
                    the Central Highlands of Vietnam [Ban Me Thuot-Kontum area]. He had been taken
                    into one of the communist “base areas” in Cambodia, number 704 if memory serves,
                    as a prisoner. One of the things that they did was to take his boots away, which
                    makes it a lot harder to run away. Nevertheless, he managed to escape and walked
                    out of the communist “base area” and back into South Vietnam, where he managed
                    to be picked up by American forces.</p>
                <p>I went out to the medical clearing station near the Saigon airport and MACV
                    headquarters, where he was being treated, to interview him. He'd been brought in
                    for medical treatment, as his feet were all torn up. He had walked out of the
                    “base area” barefoot, through the jungle. I wanted to talk to him about what he
                    saw, what was there, and what the “base area” looked like.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Of course, he couldn't tell me very much. But it was interesting to see all of
                    these wounded American soldiers at this medical clearing station near the
                    airport. The severely wounded were being evacuated to Japan for further hospital
                    treatment. I saw a lot of these beat up Americans—just kids. You know what movie
                    they were watching on AFVN Television [American Forces in Vietnam]? They were
                    watching “Combat,” a TV serial on the American Army in combat in Europe during
                    World War II. Every week you had a new episode of this war. Here were all of
                    these kids—literally kids, who had legs and arms blown off and terribly beaten
                    up. People talk about being “anti-war.” If you haven't been in a ward full of
                    wounded soldiers, you really don't appreciate what war is all about. That struck
                    me—the irony of soldiers wounded in Vietnam watching a TV series on World War
                    II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the atmosphere in our Embassy? At this time you
                        were in this huge Political Section [in Saigon]. What was the atmosphere
                        about what was happening? Was everybody so busy that you weren't focusing
                        on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There was a lot of concern, about corruption, which was considered a
                    major issue. We were very concerned about the corruption of our allies—the
                    wholesale theft of PX items for example by the Thai and the Filipinos in
                    particular. Our Political-Military unit worked very hard to stop the use of
                    “Agent Orange” for defoliation—to stop defoliation completely. You remember that
                    the defoliation effort was called “Operation Ranch Hand.” They were quite
                    prescient to realize what that meant.</p>
                <p>I remember the son of my first boss in the Foreign Service, a guy I had worked
                    for in the State Department in 1961. His youngest son received an ROTC [Reserve
                    Officer Training Corps] commission and was sent to Vietnam as an infantry
                    officer. He looked me up in the Embassy. He used to come down to Saigon for
                    weekends, when he could get time off from his base camp up near the Cambodian
                    border. He would come down, and we would talk. I would show him a little bit of
                    the night life of Saigon.</p>
                <p>He told me what it was like to lead an infantry platoon through these defoliated
                    forests. We allegedly defoliated them so that we could see the enemy. Nobody was
                    thinking about the chemical impact on the immune system of our soldiers, or
                    anything like that. He said, “These are triple canopy forests. You defoliate the
                    first canopy, you might even get the second canopy.” Literally, these planes
                    would fly over the forest and turn everything gray. They would kill all of the
                    leaves. But he said, “You still had to walk down there, through all of the third
                    canopy, which is all of the lower brush. But with the sun beating down on you,
                    it would be like a Turkish bath.” He said that it was “murder” to move through
                    these areas, because the defoliation really didn't help all of that much. So he
                    felt that it didn't make any sense to do this. He wondered why we were spraying
                    this stuff all over the place. Our Political-Military unit, was trying to stop
                    defoliation, and eventually we did stop it.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>It was interesting that one of the people that I had a lot to deal with in
                    connection with the Cambodian arms traffic was the Commander of the U. S. Navy
                    Forces in Vietnam, Admiral Elmo “Bud” Zumwalt. He went on to become Chief of
                    Naval Operations. I worked with him directly. He had been Naval Attach� in
                    Denmark at one point in his career, so he had a very good appreciation of how
                    Embassies work, unlike most of the military guys, who had no understanding of
                    diplomatic niceties or our requirements and needs, and the context within which
                    an Embassy had to work.</p>
                <p>It was ironic that one of Zumwalt's sons was running a patrol boat [in the
                    Riverine Forces, the so-called “Brown Water Navy”], down in the Mekong Delta,
                    along the Cambodian border. The son had been sprayed by these defoliants several
                    times and eventually came down with cancer and died. Of course, Zumwalt had
                    ordered the defoliation of these waterways as part of his function as Commander
                    of Naval Forces in Vietnam to cut down areas for ambush. Our boats used to be
                    ambushed down there. It was a terrible, moral burden for “Bud” Zumwalt that, in
                    fact, he had believed that he was responsible for killing his own son in the
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the reporting as far as what was
                        “getting through?” Was there a kind of ferment, say, among the Political
                        Officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Let me give you a personal observation on that. I'm glad that you
                    mentioned it. I was the Embassy Duty Officer the week of the May offensive of
                    1968. The “Tet” offensive took place in February 1968. The next “high point” was
                    expected to be in May. I forget why that was. There was a holiday in May. We
                    expected a repeat of the “Tet” offensive, when they [the communists] almost got
                    into the Embassy. I remember the first night that I was on duty [during this
                    period]. The Embassy Duty Officer spent the night at the Embassy, sleeping in a
                    small room next to the Code Room on the top floor of the Embassy. He had a flak
                    vest and a pistol. This was early May 1968. We didn't run the air conditioning
                    in the building at night, because paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division
                    guarding the building were stationed on the catwalks between the sunscreen and
                    the building. We had the paratroopers there and turned the air conditioning off,
                    so that they could hear if people were skulking in the bushes surrounding the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>The building was kind of silent when I went to bed that particular night. I heard
                    a couple of mortar explosions go off up the street. So I jumped into my pants,
                    pulled on my flak vest, buckled the pistol belt, pushed the elevator button, and
                    went down to the Embassy lobby. The Marine Guards were running around in
                    circles. One of them looked out the back door and said, “Son of a bitch! The
                    back gate's open.” I thought that this was no place for me. I punched the button
                    and went back upstairs, went into the Code Room, and locked the door.</p>
                <p>That was the opening salvo of the May offensive. It was not as severe as the Tet
                    offensive. There was a lot of fighting...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in Cholon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: In Cholon. There was a battle around the “Y” bridge [on the south side
                    of Cholon]. The 47th Infantry Regiment, in which I took my infantry basic
                    training in 1952 at Ft. Dix, NJ, was involved in it. My job was to stay in
                    contact with everybody. I called the MACV Situation Room every morning to find
                    out what was going on. I also called Washington and talked to John Burke,
                    Director of the Vietnam Desk. I was in a kind of loop at night. I called each of
                    the Corps areas and learned what was going on. I was preparing my own
                    intelligence summaries, right from individual sources, before anyone had a
                    chance to “massage” this information. The information which I assembled was put
                    in a cable, which we would send out to the Department, reporting what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>The commander of U. S. Forces in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, was very
                    irritated at these cables that were going out and which his people hadn't
                    seen—reporting what was going on in the country, before his staff had a chance
                    to look at the information. Deputy Ambassador Sam Berger said that MACV was
                    complaining bitterly about these cables. However John Burke, said, “Keep up the
                    good work. The only way that we know what's going on there is what you're
                    sending us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There was the whole “body count” issue and the whole matter of
                    “massaging” impressions of what was going on. This was another reason why we had
                    this Provincial Reporting Unit—so that our guys, who reported through the
                    Embassy, but not to AID or to the military, would go around and try to find out
                    what was actually going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would happen? Let's say that they would go out, and
                        we would get information from the Provincial Reporters which indicated that
                        MACV was putting its own “twist” on a given situation. Would the Embassy
                        report something different from MACV or would it end up going through a
                        process of “synthesis” so that everybody reported the same thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I can't answer that directly. All I know is that the Provincial
                    Reporting Officers would come into Saigon from time to time. There were five of
                    them [Actually, the Unit reached a high point of eight officers, including the
                    chief of the Unit.]. They had a boss whose name escapes me [Tom Conlon]. He was
                    Political Counselor when I was in Bangkok, and John Burke was DCM. There were
                    four guys that I remember: Jim Mack and two David Brown's: David E. Brown and
                    David G. Brown, both of whom are now Office Directors in East Asia, one for
                    Korea and one for Regional Affairs. These were bright, young guys several who
                    spoke Vietnamese. Some of them had just come into the service or out of language
                    school at the FSI and were still “feeling their way”. They were assigned to
                    different areas of South Vietnam and traveled as they thought suitable
                    [sometimes by plane, sometimes by automobile or truck, usually alone and
                    frequently at substantial risk to their lives], picking up information. They
                    would come in and “dump” their material on someone [Tom Conlon, as chief of the
                    Provincial Reporting Unit]. I think that their message was getting through but I
                    think that their reporting, given the interagency politics that had to go on,
                    may well have “pulled its punches.” There are many ways to do that. I saw the
                    same kind of thing more directly in Cambodia, more so than in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll come to that later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We'll come to that, because I was Desk Officer for Cambodia. I knew the
                    guys in Cambodia and I knew what was coming out. I believed that I understood
                    what was happening in Cambodia. I had to assume—from my own experience of what
                    was going on in Vietnam—that the same kind of thing took place there. Of course,
                    it [the U. S. presence in Vietnam] was much bigger. It was enormous. The CIA
                    alone had an enormous computer capability by that time [in Saigon]. They were
                    feeding in all kinds of material. They were getting all of the answers that they
                    needed. They could produce any answer you wanted, based on the data that was
                    being fed into it. There was an enormous “scam.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andy, within the Political Section, was there a chasm
                        between, may I say, Martin Herz, Sam Berger, and Ellsworth Bunker—that
                        level—and the officers who were going out in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I don't think so. The one thing I clearly recollect is that I did not
                    serve under Phil Habib [during this time Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
                    with particular responsibility for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia]. I came in after
                    Phil Habib had been Political Counselor in Saigon. I'll tell you, anybody who
                    had to fill Phil Habib's shoes had a big job. He had such a manner and such
                    ability to relate to his officers. He was such an iconoclast himself that he was
                    just wonderful to work for. He motivated everybody. He was tremendously loyal
                    but at the same time he was a hard taskmaster.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>He was replaced by Arch Calhoun. Arch hated to be reminded of the fact that he
                    had been Ambassador to Chad, because he hated that place. He said that he didn't
                    want to be reminded that he had been Ambassador in Chad, “that awful place.” He
                    was a German specialist. He had been U. S. Minister in Berlin. His reward was to
                    be assigned to Saigon as Political Counselor.</p>
                <p>This is a kind of reminder of the jobs we had in Saigon. We had former
                    Ambassadors as Section Chiefs, which we never do in the American system. Other
                    foreign services do this all the time. It's nothing for a foreign ambassador to
                    serve subsequently as consul general in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They don't carry the title with them. We do. It's about
                        the one title we have that we carry around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: If you've been an Ambassador, you have to be at an ambassadorial level
                    in subsequent assignments or you are forcibly retired. But Vietnam was special.
                    We had such large numbers of assets. I mean, 25 Foreign Service Officers in the
                    Political Section! The Political Section was bigger than most of our Embassies
                    throughout the world.</p>
                <p>Arch Calhoun was a different breed of cat. He was a more soft-spoken kind of guy.
                    Habib was a real “blue collar” type guy, and everyone loved him for it. He
                    encouraged people to speak out. He encouraged people to be iconoclastic. You
                    could tell that. People would say things in staff meetings that I could hardly
                    believe. I felt that they were really telling people off or speaking their mind.
                    This had quite an impact, I thought, for several years after Habib left Saigon
                    and the East Asian Bureau. Of course, I worked for Phil Habib in the East Asian
                    Bureau, toward the end of the Indochina experience. I had a real sense of how he
                    operated. It was wonderful to work for a guy like Phil Habib. He looked to you
                    to say what you really think. He would ask questions like, “Do you think? What
                    do you think?” He made clear that he wanted to know what we really felt.</p>
                <p>In the Bureau of East Asian Affairs he would have meetings with the lower-ranking
                    Desk Officers from time to time, without the Country Directors [their
                    supervisors] present. He wanted to hear the unvarnished attitudes and opinions
                    of his officers. I think that this is the best way to operate. This is a system
                    which I used when I became a supervisor. In my later career as a supervisor I
                    tried to encourage people to say what they really thought. Are we doing
                    something right or not? People can't argue that I didn't give them a chance to
                    say what they thought. Of course I found out that a lot of people don't think at
                    all.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I think that from Ambassador Bunker on down people were encouraged to say what
                    they felt and how they saw things. But once you've done that, you've done your
                    job. It was up to the senior officers in their relationships with the military,
                    the CIA, or the host government to carry out the policy. If you couldn't live
                    with that, then you had better get the hell out of the Foreign Service. You
                    should quit. And a number of people did that.</p>
                <p>Dick Holbrooke is one of those who quit. He went on, after his Vietnam
                    experience, to go into politics, in effect. He's done very well for himself.
                    That's your choice. There is a discipline within the Foreign Service. If you
                    can't tolerate the policy, and you might well not tolerate the policy, the only
                    honorable thing to do is to get out, once you have had your say, once you feel
                    that you've really aired your feelings.</p>
                <p>Now, one of the things that I did get involved in was dealing with the French,
                    which in this context meant dealing with the rubber plantations [in South
                    Vietnam]. I was the point of contact when our military would do something
                    involving the rubber plantations. They would do two things. One, they would
                    defoliate or, more importantly, use bulldozers with the “Rome Plow” attachments.
                    They would cut down hundreds of thousands of trees on their main supply routes
                    which ran through the plantations, on the ground that the communists were
                    ambushing their convoys going through the plantations.</p>
                <p>Well, without telling anybody, the U. S. Army would go in on a weekend and cut
                    down 100,000 trees. The Army started with a 50 meter margin on each side of a
                    main supply route, cutting down these rubber trees. Then they would widen these
                    margins to 100 meters on each side. Finally, in 1969, I think, they widened them
                    further to 200 meters on each side. So that's a quarter of a mile. Of course,
                    the Viet Cong would sit behind that patch of plantation and lob shells onto the
                    roads, because they had them zeroed in. When the U. S. Army cut down these
                    trees, they left windrows—piles of brush, which made excellent ambush sites. The
                    Viet Cong would burrow into these trees and shoot at armored vehicles or trucks
                    or whatever was coming through. So we had big arguments with the military.</p>
                <p>I remember trying to make a case that the rubber plantations were an economic
                    asset that should be preserved for peacetime use, and we should not be
                    destroying them. It really did not make much all that much sense from a military
                    point of view. So we would have these big fights with the U.S. military. I found
                    that the Embassy supported me. My “clients” were the French, who would come to
                    us. Basically, they cooperated with us. The French were very helpful. They knew
                    what the Viet Cong were doing in their plantations. They would pass the
                    information to me. On more than one weekend I would go up to the plantations and
                    spend the weekend—fly up in the rubber plantation airplane. Do you remember a
                    guy who ran the American Chamber of Commerce when you were Consul General in
                    Seoul? He's a retired brigadier general, a heavy set guy. His name was Frederick
                    “Brick” Krause.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Anyway, I first met Krause when he was a full Colonel and brigade commander in
                    the 1st Division at the Quan Loi rubber plantation [Binh Long province], up near
                    the Cambodian border. I had gone up to investigate a defoliation complaint by
                    the plantation. The U. S. Army had defoliated a bunch of young [recently
                    planted] rubber trees—not the old trees. I went there and was standing by this
                    Colonel's CP [Command Post]. We'd just gotten off the plane. The French rubber
                    plantation manager was there. The Viet Cong had apparently seen our plane come
                    in and decided to lob some shells into the CP area. You should have seen five
                    guys try to get into a one-man hole! I remember the Frenchman standing there,
                    looking scathingly at these Americans, scurrying for cover.</p>
                <p>Krause retired from the Army as a brigadier general in Korea. I ran into him at
                    the residence of Ambassador Dick Sneider, when we had the East Asia Consular
                    Conference in 1977. You were there, weren't you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, this brigadier general was at the reception that Dick Sneider had
                    for the conference. I said, “God, you look familiar.” And then I found out that
                    this guy had been a brigade commander whom I had visited in Vietnam at that
                    time. We have remained very good friends since that time.</p>
                <p>I think that the Embassy was supportive of trying to “rein in” the American
                    military, because the military became a virtual law unto themselves. It was a
                    lot harder to deal with them on PX corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was a member of something called “The Irregular
                        Practices Committee.” I was the chairman of it, which was a kind of civilian
                        court martial. Did you get at all involved with the “More Flags” business
                        and the corruption of the Thai, in particular and the Filipinos? The Koreans
                        had this so well organized that it wasn't even corruption. They just...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, what happened for example, was that the manager of the Commissary
                    or the PX in Cholon was a Filipino employee. He was one of those “TCN's,” or
                    Third Country Nationals. The PX would get in a supply of TV sets, stereos, or
                    whatever. He would call PHILCAG, Philippine Civic Action Group, which was out in
                    Tay Ninh province. He would call them, and they would scarf up everything that
                    had come in. I was in Saigon for months before I could buy a TV set. The old saw
                    about the Thai was that, “If we could only maneuver the Viet Cong between the
                    Thai and the PX, we'd have a military victory on our hands.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember watching Thai soldiers being marched into
                        the PX. They would each buy the limit of whatever they could. This was a
                        whole unit. Then they would turn it over to their officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: They would buy refrigerators and sell them off the back of their
                    trucks. It was on such a wholesale basis. Our military took the view that this
                    was simply the cost of doing business, and who cares? “We'll bring in more and
                    sell whatever we can.” Our allies were so corrupt. It used to anger everybody in
                    the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a lot of our military, too. Do you remember seeing the
                        Provost Marshal of Saigon, standing outside of the PX, watching these Thai
                        go in there and just...He was red faced, his jaw muscles quivering.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We had the same thing in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling in the Political Section about the
                        Vietnamese Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: They felt that it was pretty weak. There was always a question in
                    everybody's mind whether or not these people were going to be able to “hack it.”
                    Thinking back on that time, I'd really have to give the matter some thought. I
                    think the situation was pretty hopeless,' from our point of view. The problem
                    was so insuperable, given our inability to stop the North Vietnamese from
                    reinforcing their troops in the South. How can you possibly protect hamlets? We
                    had this hamlet protection program and all the other “gimmicks” that we tried.
                    For example, the Vietnamese Government, with U. S. support, took people and
                    resettled them in villages that they tried to protect. How could you do that,
                    when you couldn't stop the infiltration of the military forces, the ammunition,
                    and all the supplies that the communists needed?</p>
                <p>It was all part of the same situation, you know. You couldn't solve the problem
                    in Cambodia and Laos or stop the communists at the DMZ [Demilitarized Zone,
                    roughly the 17th Parallel of North Latitude]. How could you possibly bring any
                    kind of security to the countryside?</p>
                <p>I'm convinced that if we could have handled the military problem successfully,
                    the political problem could have been solved. There really was no political
                    problem. The South Vietnamese didn't want to be communists. It was also very
                    evident that nobody wanted to be a communist in Cambodia. Nobody believed any of
                    that “liberation” blarney. It was just that we couldn't solve the military
                    problem with our own self-imposed limitations, which involved how to stop the
                    communists from coming down from the North.</p>

                <p>ANTIPPAS: February 1970. Somewhat in disgrace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was very interesting. I really thought that I would be promoted to
                    FSO-4 for the good work which I had done in Saigon—and I really had done good
                    work. I got pretty good ratings on my efficiency reports from my several bosses
                    in the External Unit of the Political Section. I worked hard. I think that I
                    once went three months without getting out to Bangkok to see my wife. My son was
                    born there in Bangkok. In Vietnam I was shot at. I was running around in the
                    woods with the U. S. military.</p>
                <p>But I had a personality problem with the chief of the Political Section under
                    Martin Herz, the Political Counselor [who replaced Arch Calhoun]. Martin Herz
                    liked me personally. He was the resident Cambodia expert in the Foreign Service.
                    He had served in Cambodia in the mid 1950's and had written a little book, “A
                    Short History of Cambodia.” You might remember it. Since I was the Cambodia
                    expert in the Political Section, he liked me. I had known him from my first job
                    in the Foreign Service. He was in the Africa Bureau when I was setting up
                    conferences. So I had a pretty good relationship with him. Martin Herz was a
                    very tough taskmaster. I've seen him make grown men cry. He was tough. He could
                    take faster dictation than most secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did his own shorthand and his own typing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Anyhow, I got along with him and thought I got along with the section
                    chief as well, because he and I were both from Massachusetts. He was a
                    Massachusetts “blue blood.” His wife was “safe havened” in India. He went from
                    Saigon to be DCM in New Delhi under the former U.S. Senator from New York. Was
                    his name Keating? It turned out that this officer would pass through Bangkok on
                    his way to New Delhi and have dinner with my wife at our house, while waiting
                    for his flight. She'd pick him up at the airport in Bangkok. So I thought that
                    we had a good relationship.</p>
                <p>Anyway, without a long “to do” about it, there was a “glitch” in our
                    relationship. He got angry with me and wrote in my efficiency report for 1969
                    that he questioned my judgment about something that I had done. That's all
                    that's needed in the Foreign Service. An efficiency report was then as now, so
                    important. My file was put down at the bottom of the pile. I was ranked in the
                    lowest 5% of my class. You hope to be in the top 5% of your class to be
                    promoted. When you're in the lowest 5% of your class, you are what they call
                    “low ranked” for that year. If you were “low ranked” a second year in those
                    days, you were selected out of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I wasn't promoted that year [1969]. What had happened was that all onward
                    assignments were canceled. I had just then wangled an onward assignment to the
                    Armed Forces Staff College at Norfolk, followed by assignment to Greek language
                    training. I had asked for Romanian or Greek. So I had been given what I wanted.
                    Roger Kirk, who was my boss in Saigon, wangled this Greek language training,
                    followed by an onward assignment to Athens. Because of my “low ranking,” the
                    training assignments were canceled.</p>
                <p>I remember that Martin Herz called me up to his office, on December 22, 1969. He
                    said, “I just got this 'back channel' message from Personnel in Washington that
                    says that you've been 'low ranked.'” I was due to go home in January or
                    February. Herz said, “They want to know when you're going home. They want to
                    talk to you.”</p>
                <p>I was devastated by that. I said, “Look, I've got to go to Bangkok and tell my
                    wife. No way I can tell her over the telephone.” I had really screwed up this
                    great adventure of the Foreign Service in a major fashion. There was a question
                    as to whether I had a career. You remember the telephone system available at
                    overseas Embassies at the time. This is before we had communications satellites.
                    In the war zone we had military switches. The switchboard in Saigon would go to
                    a switchboard someplace else, say, in Thailand. You had to go through about four
                    different switchboards to make a civilian telephone call, including the Thai
                    civilian telephone system. So, more often than not, you'd start a telephone
                    conversation with your wife and family, and you'd be cut off. You'd be
                    pre-empted by a higher priority telephone call. I told Herz that I had to tell
                    my wife about this disaster, face to face. So Herz authorized me to catch a
                    military flight and go over and tell her. Bless her soul, she took it very well.
                    I was really down about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you known, or was this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It came out of the blue. I had not expected that at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Herz understand what the situation was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, I think that he understood. But, you know, the section chief did
                    this to a number of people in the Political Section, particularly unit chiefs.
                    He did this to Bob Shackleton, who was the Political-Military guy, and three or
                    four other guys. He “clobbered” a number of other people. So I left Saigon very
                    depressed. I thought, “Well, where do we go from here?”</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>What happened after that was interesting. We decided to take a slow boat home. I
                    didn't have an assignment to go back to in the Department, until I talked to
                    Personnel. So we thought that we might as well take a ship home. Judy and the
                    baby came over from Bangkok and joined me in Manila, where we caught the
                    American President Lines ship, the “SS Cleveland,” which was one of the last of
                    the passenger “liners.” We took two weeks on the ship from Manila to Yokohama
                    and Honolulu. We flew home from Honolulu, went to Canada to be with Judy's
                    family, and then went down to Washington and took our house back in
                    Bethesda.</p>
                <p>Finally, I sauntered in to see Personnel. They couldn't really explain what
                    happened. They said, “Well, cool it and see what happens. Meanwhile, we're going
                    to put you to work on this Task Force that we've just set up that's going to
                    computerize the State Department's files. They put me in with this great gaggle
                    of people and sent me to Anacostia, where the Navy had a computer school. It was
                    really fascinating that a guy who can barely balance his checkbook was sent to
                    computer training! It was hilarious. Meanwhile, we set up housekeeping in
                    Bethesda. I also decided to opt for the “Consular Cone”. You will recall this
                    was about the time that the Service required you to pick an occupational
                    specialty: political, economic, administrative or consular. I didn't
                    particularly want to but I decided I might as well pick a specialty where I can
                    go back overseas again right away as well as stand a chance of promotion. I had
                    obviously not done the political specialty very well.</p>
                <p>We were now getting into March 1970. Sihanouk was overthrown on March 9th. In
                    fact, we were with Roger Kirk, my former, immediate supervisor in Saigon, not
                    far from here, having dinner with Roger and his wife. He was EA duty officer
                    that night. He was a special assistant to Bill Sullivan, who was then the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of East Asian Affairs, dealing with Indochina. Roger got a
                    telephone call from the Operations Center at the Department, while we were
                    eating, telling him that Sihanouk had just been overthrown. So we talked about
                    it. The great question was, “What does this mean? Is this real, or is this some
                    gambit of Sihanouk's?” Sihanouk loved these ploys to get sympathy.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I went off to the Navy computer school at Anacostia for two weeks. I had earlier
                    gone by the State Department and was debriefed by Tom Corcoran, who was the
                    Laos, Cambodia Country Director, and others from INR [Intelligence and
                    Research], when I came home. The Laos, Cambodia office of course was very busy
                    in March, because the Cambodians were under attack by the Vietnamese communists.
                    The question was, “How long are the Cambodians going to last?” There was the
                    murder of a large number of Vietnamese civilians. You might remember this when
                    it took place. Western news media found over 200 Vietnamese bodies floating in
                    the Mekong River, all with their hands tied behind their back. The Cambodians
                    explained this by saying that a ferry crossing the river had capsized. Oh yeah?
                    The Cambodians got a very big, public relations black eye for that. The
                    Cambodians were taking it out on the Vietnamese civilian population inside
                    Cambodia which was very large. Anyhow, I told Tom Corcoran, “Look, I don't have
                    much of a job.” I didn't explain what my problem was, or anything like that. I
                    said, “You must need somebody to go out and get the coffee or help out. I'm
                    available.” So I went off to this computer course.</p>
                <p>The day the course finished was a Friday. We got out around noon. I was going to
                    go down to Springfield, Virginia, where Hecht's or Woodward &amp; Lothrop had
                    one of those clearance warehouses. We were looking for furniture. On the way I
                    stopped by the State Department to see if anybody on the desk wanted to have
                    lunch. I walked in around noontime. Tom Corcoran's secretary, Dallas MacGlynn
                    said, “Where have you been? Mr. Corcoran's been looking all over for you. Go
                    right on in. He wants to see you.” Tom was a very laid-back, soft spoken
                    individual. He said, “You were imprudent enough to throw your hat in the ring.”
                    This was when he told me, as I mentioned previously, that I was being assigned
                    to the Embassy in Phnom Penh over Mike Rives' objections.</p>
                <p>I didn't have to have a brick wall fall on me to figure out what was going on. I
                    still had my diplomatic passport and had not yet turned it in. So I went down
                    and got my ticket. I went home, cut the grass, and told my wife that I'd be back
                    in a couple of weeks. In fact, I didn't know when in hell I would be back—or if
                    I'd ever come back. I left Washington on the following Monday morning, on my way
                    to Phnom Penh, before anybody could change his mind!</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>On the way to Phnom Penh, I stopped off in Saigon to check in, to “stage in” to
                    Phnom Penh and find out what was going on. I stayed with Walt Cutler, who had
                    been my boss in Saigon. He went on to be Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. He also
                    replaced Roger Kirk as Bill Sullivan's special assistant for Vietnam. Walt had
                    served in the Cameroons in the late 1950s and was the Junior Staff Assistant to
                    Secretary Rusk when Coby Swank was the Senior aide. Walt was a good guy. I also
                    went to see Admiral Zumwalt, who had just been designated to become Chief of
                    Naval Operations. I went over to congratulate him. I said to him, “Look, I don't
                    know how long this Cambodian situation is going to last.” We talked about it.
                    This was now April 26, 1970. I said, “We may get shot out of Phnom Penh.” We
                    speculated about what Sihanouk was up to. I said, “You're going on to be Chief
                    of Naval Operations. Would you have a slot for a Foreign Service Officer on your
                    staff?” I was thinking that I had to find a job. Zumwalt said, “That's an
                    interesting idea. Let's think about that.”</p>
                <p>So I went to Phnom Penh and did my job there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Let me just finish this story, because it ties up my Vietnam experience
                    in an interesting fashion. What had happened was that when I left Saigon in late
                    January, 1970, I had been to a farewell party that Walt Cutler had for me. Some
                    of the Navy and Marine officers from Zumwalt's staff were at the party. They
                    heard that I'd been “shafted” by the State Department and that I was going home
                    in a kind of disgrace. They reported this to Zumwalt. Unbeknownst to me, Zumwalt
                    at that time wrote a letter to Secretary of State William Rogers, describing my
                    contributions to the Navy's effort to determine where the guns and ammunition
                    were coming from for the Vietnamese communists and who was doing what to whom in
                    Cambodia. He said that I'd collaborated with the Navy in exemplary fashion on
                    border incidents, because his boats [of the Riverine Force] became involved in
                    firing at Cambodia too. He said that, because Mr. Antippas is a civilian, the
                    Navy couldn't give him an award, but he suggested that perhaps the State
                    Department could do so. A year later, in 1971, I was given a Superior Honor
                    Award for the work that I had done on Cambodia. For the same period that I was
                    “low-ranked” I was given a Superior Honor Award two years later! The medal and
                    certificate finally caught up with me, through Saigon. Ambassador Coby Swank
                    presented me the medal in Phnom Penh at a small party in the Residence and the
                    photo appeared in the State Department Bulletin.</p>
                <p>To this day I have never found out what specifically made me “low-ranked in
                    1969.” Of course, it scared the hell out of me, because I thought it meant the
                    end of my career. It just shows that you never know how things might work out.
                    You just have to keep trying. I was flabbergasted and terribly pleased, because
                    it got me promoted, too in the 1972 list. So I made FSO-4 two years later than I
                    thought I would.</p>

                        matter of great concern to you, things worked out fairly well for you. As
                        you have already said, you were assigned to the Embassy in Phnom Penh in the

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We had already reopened our Embassy in Phnom Penh in the summer of
                    1969, with Mike Rives as charg� d'affaires, as I said. Mike had served in the
                    Consulate in Hanoi, along with Tom Corcoran, before 1954. He had gone on to
                    serve in Africa at a number of posts. He had been charg� at least three times.
                    He was selected to be charg� d'affaires in Phnom Penh because he had no recent
                    Indochina experience. Initially, the Embassy remained small, headed by the
                    charg� and with a small staff, including a military Attach� , an Administrative
                    Officer and one political/economic officer, two secretaries and a communicator.
                    There were only eight Americans in the Embassy in Phnom Penh in March, 1970,
                    when Sihanouk was overthrown, things began to happen, and world attention began
                    to focus on Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I knew that everything was short in Phnom Penh, so when I stopped off in Saigon,
                    I stocked up with a couple of suitcases full of whisky and other “goodies.” As I
                    mentioned before, I saw Admiral Zumwalt, who had been nominated to be the new
                    Chief of Naval Operations. I met with Zumwalt on the morning of April 27, 1970,
                    just a few days before we began the Cambodian “incursion” on May 1, 1970. I
                    wondered later on if Zumwalt knew that this incursion was about to begin. Very
                    few people in MACV knew about it in advance. The operation was only set up in
                    the last three or four days of April, 1970. Even Secretary of State Rogers
                    didn't know that we were planning this because on April 25, 1970, about the time
                    I left Washington, he was testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee, chaired by Senator William Fulbright, that the United States had no
                    intention of intervening in Cambodia. It made him look kind of silly after we
                    marched in a five days later.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Phnom Penh on the afternoon of April 27, 1970. Mike Rives, the
                    charg� d'affaires, set me up in a little flea bag of a hotel in downtown Phnom
                    Penh. We began work to find out what was happening, both politically and in
                    terms of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, this is Tape 3, Side A, of the interview with Andy
                        Antippas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I mentioned previously that John Stein, a CIA officer who had
                    previously served in Africa, arrived in Phnom Penh shortly before I did. The
                    White House had insisted on a CIA presence because of the need to know what was
                    going on, despite the opposition of Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield to
                    such an assignment.</p>
                <p>It was interesting that Stein's “cover” in the Embassy was to be the Consul. He
                    had never done consular work. Over the months that followed, whenever a
                    visitor's visa or an immigrant visa had to be issued, one of us would have to go
                    down to the consular section to handle it for him. Then he would sign it. Over
                    the months, because I was an “activist” type and was out running around, looking
                    at the war, riding in helicopters, and flying in the Air Attach� 's airplane—he
                    had a C-47—most of the journalists covering Cambodia at that time figured that I
                    was the CIA guy, and Stein was the consul. It was sort of fun, and I always told
                    Stein that I should have been put on the payroll, since I was the “target.”</p>
                <p>Of course, we spent a very hectic summer in 1970. When the U. S. “incursion” of
                    Cambodia took place, we didn't know about it. The “New York Times” correspondent
                    almost “beat” Mike Rives to Lon Nol's residence to inform him that we had just
                    marched into Cambodia. Henry Kamm, the “Times” correspondent had the news almost
                    before Mike Rives did. The incursion created quite a clamor, of course. However,
                    those of us who were there or had any experience with the Cambodian relationship
                    to the war wondered what the big “to do” was all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'd been bombing, we'd been shooting across the
                        border...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: As one U. S. 1st Division officer told me in Vietnam in 1968, when
                    talking about the area called the “Fishhook,” one of the places where our troops
                    marched in, he called it, “Wall to wall North Vietnamese.” There was nothing out
                    there but North Vietnamese. So we wondered what everybody was getting so excited
                    about.</p>
                <p>I was surprised at the incursion and, then again, not surprised. If you thought
                    about it—and this was the theory on which I based a paper at the National War
                    College—first, I didn't believe that the White House participated in the
                    overthrow of Sihanouk. I think that it took place in spite of anything that the
                    White House wanted to do. It had always been our perception and policy that we
                    really couldn't influence events like that. To suggest that we were seeking to
                    turn the Cambodian Armed Forces against the Vietnamese communists was ludicrous.
                    It was like throwing the baby out with the bath water. I think that the White
                    House, and particularly the State Department, was as surprised as anyone at the
                    overthrow of Sihanouk. What happened was that things just got out of hand. This
                    is not to say that there were no individuals in Phnom Penh who felt that
                    Sihanouk should go and that if they, in fact, threw him out, the United States
                    would have to go along with it. We would have no choice but to support those who
                    opposed Sihanouk.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>One of the things that motivated an awful lot of these same Cambodians was that
                    there would be a return of the American aid program, which many Cambodians
                    remembered from the 1950's. They wanted that aid program to come back because of
                    the corruption and opportunities for making money.</p>
                <p>That consideration came into play, and we became captives of that particular
                    scenario, because I think that, if you put yourself in the place of the White
                    House, here we were drawing down our troops in Vietnam at this very time. We
                    could see this. We could observe this phenomenon from Cambodia: the fact that
                    American troops were no longer able to do the kinds of things that they had done
                    the year before. We could see it in the maintenance of the aircraft that came to
                    Phnom Penh—the helicopters, for example. We flew around Cambodia in MACV
                    helicopters.</p>
                <p>I think that the view was—and the reason why they decided to go along with an
                    incursion into Cambodia—that they might be able to disrupt North Vietnamese
                    supply lines. I don't think that anybody thought that there was a prayer of
                    really “nailing” North Vietnamese “main force” units, which would have a very
                    positive tactical implication. But if they could upset the North Vietnamese
                    supply system, this would buy some time. Any time that we could buy was to the
                    advantage of the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. Don't forget. A big
                    concern was to avoid a kind of “Dunkirk”. We didn't know what would happen in
                    Indochina, but we didn't want a Dunkirk. We didn't want to have to shoot our way
                    off the beaches, which would really be a terrible situation for any
                    administration.</p>
                <p>I think that was the main motivation for the incursion into Cambodia—and it
                    worked. I think that everybody was surprised. I think that the incursion was a
                    much tougher campaign than people recall. Some people think that it was just a
                    “walk through.” In point of fact the North Vietnamese fought very hard, and we
                    took very heavy casualties in Cambodia. Of course, the North Vietnamese took the
                    view, as did the Chinese communists, that we had precipitated the overthrow of
                    Sihanouk, in order to turn the Cambodians against them. They did what they had
                    to do. They turned 180 degrees around in their sanctuaries and started to attack
                    the Cambodian forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I think that the only thing left in dispute is how, in the full light of the
                    presence of international journalists, the North Vietnamese could explain the
                    overthrow of Sihanouk by Cambodians, and the subsequent occupation of Phnom Penh
                    by Vietnamese troops. The communists had always denied having sanctuaries in
                    Cambodia. That was a big question in our mind. Of course, what we did not know
                    and did not learn for almost another year was that there was an “outside” as
                    well as a “home grown” Khmer Rouge movement. There had long been a Khmer
                    communist party. It was really as pitiful in terms of its military capability as
                    the Cambodian Army. Even the Cambodian Army could keep the local Khmer Rouges on
                    the run. But what no one knew was that in 1954 the Viet Minh, when they withdrew
                    from South Vietnam and Cambodia, where there had been some small unit actions
                    before the battle of Dien Bien Phu, took some 5,000 young Cambodians to North
                    Vietnam. They took young Lao with them as well, for training and indoctrination,
                    with a view to sending them back to their home countries to start a revolution
                    at such time as the party decided that was the thing to do.</p>
                <p>Over the intervening period, which was something like 16 years [1954-1970], the
                    “home grown” Khmer Rouges had often pleaded with Hanoi to send back these cadres
                    to help reduce the pressure that the Cambodian Army was putting on them. The
                    North Vietnamese had always refused to do that. They had always refused to play
                    that card because Sihanouk was cooperating with them. He was giving them pretty
                    much everything that they needed and wanted. They had border base areas and were
                    able to buy rice and medical supplies. They were getting weapons through
                    Cambodian sources, and, of course, the Cambodians were making an awful lot of
                    money from this trade, as we all knew, including Lon Nol.</p>
                <p>We did not know, in fact, that there was a very large number of Cambodian cadres
                    available to start a Cambodian civil war. It was just a question of how the
                    North Vietnamese would explain this.</p>
                <p>One of the other things that we did not understand was that by June, 1970, the
                    North Vietnamese had fought their way almost all the way to the Cambodian-Thai
                    border. They occupied the Angkor Wat complex. By June 1970 they besieged Siem
                    Reap, which is two-thirds of the way, across Cambodia, to Thailand. Very
                    quickly, it became impossible to drive across Cambodia, which we used to be able
                    to do. We used to be able to drive from Saigon to the Thai border in about 24
                    hours, if you caught all the ferries right across the various rivers. Nobody
                    seemed able to explain what the North Vietnamese were doing, going all of that
                    distance, because by that time the Nixon administration had already announced
                    that the incursion was going to be very limited in duration—two months—and that
                    American forces wouldn't go any deeper than 25 kilometers inside Cambodia.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>In fact, it became a great game for the journalists to drive, say, 26 kilometers
                    into Cambodia “looking for the Americans” so that they could make a scandal out
                    of their report. There was an interesting kind of by-play once in June, with a
                    number of international journalists, including some Americans, who were cut off
                    by North Vietnamese North of Phnom Penh. They had gone out to watch some
                    operation. You were never safe, even with a Cambodian battalion around you. One
                    of the American journalists came rushing into the Embassy when I happened to be
                    duty officer one afternoon. He said that they needed American helicopter support
                    to bail the journalists out. They were up on Route 6 some place. I carefully
                    explained to him that U. S. forces were precluded from going into Cambodia any
                    deeper than 25 kilometers. However, I said that I would note the interest of the
                    journalists and report this to the Cambodian Ministry of Defense. The Ministry
                    of Defense had the responsibility of protecting these guys.</p>
                <p>I reported all of this to Mike Rives and to the Military Attach�, who, of course,
                    referred to all of these guys in very scatological terms, more or less in the
                    sense that “They can go screw themselves.” I managed to convince the Colonel
                    that he had better report it to the Defense Ministry in case the journalists
                    were caught and murdered as seemed to happen quite regularly.</p>
                <p>It became very evident a year later when we became aware of the existence of all
                    of these North Vietnamese-trained Cambodian cadres that what the North
                    Vietnamese had been doing in going so deep into Cambodia was the classic
                    communist ploy: getting as much of the population as possible with a view to
                    dragooning them into the Khmer Rouge army. That's what they did, in fact. These
                    5,000 Cambodian cadres came back to Cambodia, created units, and set up training
                    programs. Two years later, by the time of the Easter offensive in South Vietnam
                    in April, 1972, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong main force units which had
                    been fighting the Cambodian Army up to that point withdrew from Cambodia and
                    went to South Vietnam to participate in that offensive. The bodies of Cambodian
                    communist soldiers began to be found on the battlefield instead of Vietnamese.
                    It was very clear that we had been fighting Vietnamese [communists] up to that
                    point. After that, it was Cambodian [communists].</p>
                <p>One of the things I did was to debrief two “ralliers,” two Khmer Rouge cadres who
                    had come back from North Vietnam, had survived, and had surrendered to the
                    Cambodian authorities. Most of those who did surrender were killed by the
                    Cambodian Army. But these two guys managed to survive. Apparently, they had been
                    picked up by American intelligence, taken to South Vietnam, debriefed, and then
                    sent back and turned over to the Cambodian authorities. The Cambodian
                    authorities decided that they would “exploit” these men and introduce them to
                    the press, as a demonstration of the “perfidy” of the North Vietnamese, that the
                    North had been planning this for many, many years and that it was all part of
                    the “international communist plot.”</p>
                <p>I persuaded the [Cambodian] military spokesman, who, interestingly enough, was
                    named Lt. Col. Am Rong. This was always greeted with great hilarity by the
                    press. He was actually a very nice fellow but dumb as a post. He was a decent
                    individual and tried very hard to do his job. We became very friendly.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>I asked him if he would let me debrief these ralliers before he released them to
                    the press, because I wanted to get a little “scoop” myself. I was irritated to
                    discover that, in fact, they had been debriefed. These two guys told me that
                    they had been taken to South Vietnam and debriefed by some [American]
                    intelligence agency, given a briefcase, a pair of combat boots, and a little
                    money, and sent back to Cambodia. We in the Embassy in Phnom Penh never saw the
                    report of their debriefing. We were never told what they had found out. So, I
                    thought, “Well, screw these bastards [who had debriefed the two Cambodian Khmer
                    Rouges]. I'm going to talk to them and then report by an LOU (Limited Official
                    Use—a low level security level for a document) or an unclassified dispatch for
                    widest possible distribution.</p>
                <p>I took the interpreter from the Political Section of the Embassy in Phnom Penh
                    and told him, “We're going to talk to these guys.” That had been my practice. I
                    found a number of old characters who had been involved in the “Khmer Issarak”
                    [Free Khmer] movement, all of the anti-French types, and anybody we could talk
                    to, and just vacuumed up as much information as I could, still heeding Tom
                    Corcoran's dictum, “Don't send us what's in the newspapers. Tell us what the
                    hell is happening.”</p>
                <p>So I debriefed these guys extensively. They were very impressive individuals. I
                    viewed all of this with a great deal of personal alarm. I said to myself, “If
                    they [the Khmer Rouges] have 5,000 guys like this, we are really in trouble. We
                    don't have anybody like these people and we never will. The political process
                    [in the United States] had dictated that there would be no “Secret War” in
                    Cambodia, as there had been in Laos. I think that it had been the intention of
                    the White House [to do the same thing in Cambodia as in Laos]. There would be no
                    opportunity to train a Cambodian military establishment, even in the “half
                    baked” fashion that we had been able to do in South Vietnam over the years. The
                    Cambodian Government would never have any kind of “level playing field” in terms
                    of trying to fight [the Khmer Rouges] themselves. The only kind of people that
                    we were able “to toss into the pot” to even the state of play were the Khmer
                    Krom, the ethnic Cambodians who had worked for the American Special Forces—the
                    “Mike Force,” or “mobile forces,” as they were called. The Khmer Krom were very
                    good troops. They were all given the opportunity to be discharged from the
                    Special Forces under Vietnamese [government] control and be transferred directly
                    into the Cambodian Army. Several battalions of them were transferred to the
                    Cambodian Army.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Of course, I knew nothing of this, as I was in Cambodia. We in the Embassy really
                    weren't “in the loop,” as it were, because we didn't have the secure ability to
                    talk to the Embassy in Saigon. In fact, Mike Rives was not even able to get time
                    off to go to Saigon for consultations. The amazing part of this whole thing was
                    that here was the American charg� d'affaires in this tiny, beleaguered Embassy
                    [in Phnom Penh], with no real opportunity for consultations with Saigon to find
                    out what the “big game plan” was. All I remember was that one day I came out of
                    my “flea bag” hotel and was standing on the main street in Phnom Penh. I saw a
                    couple of Cambodian soldiers standing there that didn't look anything like any
                    Cambodian soldiers I'd seen before. Their uniforms fit, they didn't have any
                    weapons, they had real combat boots—not just some kind of sneakers or loafers or
                    something like what Cambodian soldiers usually wore. They looked like soldiers.
                    You could tell just by their bearing.</p>
                <p>Then we discovered that, in fact, there were hundreds of these guys encamped in
                    the Olympic Stadium. They'd been brought in from South Vietnam, set up in the
                    Olympic Stadium, and then parceled out to various Cambodian Army units as cadre.
                    So that was our contribution.I found out about this because Lon Nol's younger
                    brother, [Lon Non] had asked to meet with us in the Embassy. So Mike Rives sent
                    Bob Blackburn and me to meet with him. Lon Non came to Blackburn's house and
                    brought two of these Khmer Krom officers with him. The Khmer Krom officers,
                    wearing US Army fatigues without insignias, started telling us what their
                    requirements were. He said that they needed 81 mm [mortar] ammunition, medical
                    supplies, call signs for the Forward Air Controllers, and all that. We had to
                    explain to them, “Fellows, you now belong to the Cambodian Army, and we aren't
                    going to give you anything. You are not going to get any direct support from the
                    United States.” Their disappointment was really quite palpable. I think that it
                    came as quite a shock to them that there was not going to be a “Secret War” [in
                    Cambodia] which would be stage-managed by the United States from Saigon.</p>
                <p>Two other things happened during the first couple of months that I was in the
                    Embassy in Phnom Penh. On May 4 or 5, 1970, we were informed that another
                    Special Mission aircraft was coming into Phnom Penh with a brigadier general on
                    board. We were instructed to receive him and take him to visit Lon Nol. We were
                    all wondering who this brigadier general was. Brigadier generals in the Vietnam
                    War were as common as doughnuts. In fact, they went out to get the coffee.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>We went out to the airport and met the aircraft. The brigadier general who
                    arrived—very recently promoted to brigadier general—was named Alexander Haig. He
                    was accompanied by a young NSC [National Security Council] officer named Winston
                    Lord. I had known Winston Lord from my very early days in the Foreign Service,
                    from which he later resigned. Win Lord, of course, was very well connected with
                    the Republican Party. His mother was Mary Lord, of Lord &amp; Taylor [department
                    store] and a very big, moneyed figure in the Republican Party in the Washington,
                    D. C., area. Win Lord was the “note taker” for Brigadier General Haig. Al Haig
                    was, in fact, the office manager of the NSC staff. This was his first big
                    assignment under Henry Kissinger [then Special Assistant to President Nixon for
                    National Security Affairs]. He was told to “go out and find out what the hell's
                    going on in Cambodia” and give Kissinger an assessment.</p>
                <p>This was four days after the Cambodian “incursion” began on May 1, 1970. I don't
                    know what happened. Blackburn and I really weren't privy to what went on. We
                    didn't participate in most of the meetings with Al Haig.</p>
                <p>However, my general appreciation of the situation was that Haig did not like Mike
                    Rives. I think the chemistry was bad. Rives has a an effeminate manner, sort of
                    high class English manner. Haig thought he was gay. Mike was all man though. He
                    had fought as a Marine private under Chesty Puller on Guadalcanal in the Second
                    World War. Rives came from money in Newport, Rhode Island where he counted
                    Claiborne Pell as a neighbor. Rives was also a descendent of a signer of the
                    Declaration of Independence. But he wasn't everyone's cup of tea so speak. We
                    became good friends and I worked for him for over four years in Cambodia and the
                    Department.Rives had not been particularly cooperative with MACV in Saigon.
                    During the first year after the Embassy in Phnom Penh was reopened Rives had
                    complained bitterly, almost constantly, about border incidents. He had said that
                    if MACV wasn't able to control events more effectively, the result would be that
                    the Embassy in Phnom Penh would be kicked out of Cambodia again. This, of
                    course, was viewed with a great deal of anger by the MACV establishment, from
                    Gen. Abrams on down. I had this directly from Admiral Zumwalt. They were
                    wondering whose side this guy [Mike Rives] was on. This is the kind of thing
                    that I tried to communicate to Rives. I told him that he really should be
                    careful, because he was angering the “establishment” in MACV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time you were an old hand in Vietnam and in the
                        area. Can you talk a bit about Rives? Where was he coming from and how did
                        he operate? Was he trying to play the classical diplomat's role, keeping a
                        low profile, and avoiding upsetting anything? Was he saying that diplomatic
                        relations with Cambodia were far more important than any other
                        considerations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes, that was it. His instructions from Marshall Green [then Assistant
                    Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs] were that it was important to
                    establish relations and get a dialogue going with the Cambodians. You should
                    understand that Mike Rives did not talk to Sihanouk. He never saw Sihanouk or
                    the Prime Minister of Cambodia. The highest level Cambodian he talked to, during
                    that whole period before the overthrow of Sihanouk, was the Foreign Minister.
                    Those were his instructions: keep things “low key.” There was no Embassy
                    building. He reopened the office in August, 1969, in one of the rooms of the
                    Royal Hotel [in Phnom Penh]. He sort of hung the flag out the window. One week
                    after he arrived and established his presence, Senator Mike Mansfield came and
                    had a meeting with Sihanouk. The State Department was operating from that point
                    of view: we mustn't anger Senator Mansfield and we mustn't anger Senator
                    Fulbright, who was angry enough because he felt that he had been led down the
                    garden path by the State Department in the past. I think that Mike Rives was
                    just doing his job.</p>
                <p>Admiral Zumwalt told me that one of the other things that angered the Saigon
                    “establishment” was that, during the coordinating conferences which were held
                    from time to time, when our Ambassadors from Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam would
                    get together to discuss what was going on at the theater level, they were
                    angered by Rives' absence from those meetings. However, as Rives explained it to
                    me, when I discussed it with him, he said, “Hey, I didn't have an airplane. How
                    was I supposed to go? Furthermore,” Mike said, “Marshall Green told me to 'stay
                    put' [in Phnom Penh].” Marshall reportedly said, “I don't want any other junior
                    officers to be charg� d'affaires in your absence.” Mike continued, “How was I
                    supposed to get down there? It was only an hour's flight to Saigon, but I didn't
                    have an airplane. To get to Saigon, I would have to go to Bangkok and then from
                    Bangkok, fly commercially to Saigon, which would take a whole day. I'd be absent
                    from the office for, maybe, three days, and that was unacceptable to the EA
                    [Bureau of East Asian Affairs] front office. Nobody ever sent a plane for me.
                    Nobody ever thought about sending a plane to pick me up.”</p>
                <p>Mike Rives was very conscious of [the importance of] not appearing to be
                    manipulated from Saigon. He said that it was very important that it not appear
                    that he was getting his marching orders from Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker or
                    General Abrams [in Saigon]. But this got him into trouble, because he was
                    perceived [as having no interest in the area discussions], plus the “nattering”
                    that he periodically did about incidents along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. This
                    made it appear that he was not a “team player.”</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>However, I think that Mike Rives was very much a “team player.” He was trying to
                    pick up as much intelligence as he could, given the fact that he didn't have any
                    CIA presence [in the Embassy in Phnom Penh] to help him, he had one Political
                    Officer, and he had a Military Attach� who was a drunk and apparently wasn't
                    there half of the time. The Embassy in Phnom Penh was really not very well set
                    up. [If he had gone to Saigon for these meetings], he would have gone from this
                    eight-man Embassy which was operating out of the servants' quarters of what was
                    to be the Ambassador's residence in Phnom Penh to this enormous Embassy in
                    Saigon.</p>
                <p>Don't forget that after the overthrow of Sihanouk and the U. S. “incursion” into
                    Cambodia took place, the Cooper-Church amendment was passed. This amendment
                    limited the official American presence in Cambodia to 200 people at any given
                    hour of the day. This made it almost impossible to set up a logistics operation
                    whereby you could supply the Cambodians, once we decided that the non-communist
                    Cambodians were going to survive and that we weren't going to be shot out of
                    Cambodia. Suddenly, Cambodia became sort of the living example of the “Nixon
                    Doctrine,” which stated that we would help anybody who would help themselves.
                    The Americans weren't going to do the fighting, but we would help others.</p>
                <p>The “Nixon Doctrine” was mocked by the liberal press and by those who felt that
                    we were doing the wrong thing in Cambodia. However, the fact of the matter is
                    that the Cambodians did fight. They didn't do it very well, but they did fight.
                    They lasted for a long time, and they distracted the attention of something like
                    four “main force” North Vietnamese/Viet Cong divisions. I used to know the
                    numbers of these divisions: the First and the Seventh North Vietnamese
                    Divisions, the Ninth Viet Cong Division, and something called the “C-2”
                    Division, which was made up of Vietnamese fishermen recruited from around the
                    “great lake” [Tonle Sap in Cambodia]. The Cambodian Army kept these Vietnamese
                    units busy, while, of course, they were being battered the whole time. The
                    Cambodian Army was something of a joke, in terms of being able to fight. I used
                    to say, “I wouldn't go out to look at the war with anything less than a brigade
                    because, given all of the corruption which took place, including the fact that
                    you had all of these 'phantom troops' to pad the payroll, when a brigade went
                    into action, you didn't know if there was a brigade or a battalion. The chances
                    were that you probably didn't have much more than a battalion out there.”</p>
                <p>To answer your question, I think that Mike Rives did what he was told to do. I
                    believe this was his natural inclination. He never talked much about the
                    propriety of our involvement in the Vietnam War. he was probably against it but
                    he was a good soldier. he did what he was told. After he got into trouble for
                    this, because of what happened, he then got into deeper trouble. This is all
                    very much an object lesson to a younger, observing officer such as myself about
                    how to avoid getting into trouble and how Washington works.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>In early August, 1970, Spiro Agnew, the Vice President of the United States, was
                    to make a short visit to Phnom Penh to encourage the Cambodians. It was to be a
                    four-hour visit. He was to fly into the airport. He wasn't even going to drive
                    into town from the airport. They were going to helicopter him in. He was going
                    to have lunch with the acting Chief of State, Mr. Cheng Heng, former President
                    of the National Assembly, and fly out. In fact, I never even saw the Vice
                    President of the United States. I stayed in the Embassy during the visit. The
                    Secret Service was there. There was a lot of concern about his security, because
                    there was fighting right outside of Phnom Penh. I guess that, in the “great
                    scheme of things,” it was fairly heroic on the part of Spiro Agnew to fly into a
                    besieged capital like this.</p>
                <p>I remember—you couldn't miss it, as we all occupied the same office space—that
                    when the charg� d'affaires had an important visitor, Blackburn and I would pick
                    up our files and leave the room and sit outside with the secretaries. Depending
                    on who the visitor was, Mike Rives might, in fact, move out of his chair and sit
                    on an orange crate. He made a big deal out of the fact that he was getting so
                    little support out of the State Department from Bangkok. Mike Rives was a bit of
                    a theatrical character. He was an old Africa hand, used to operating on very
                    slim rations.</p>
                <p>I will recount two incidents which kind of give you the atmosphere of what we
                    were up against in dealing with Washington. Vice President Agnew came to town
                    and, of course, the Secret Service did their usual “thing.” In the exit
                    interview, after the Secret Service left—and remember that they'd been in Phnom
                    Penh for two weeks, programming this visit out and working out exactly what was
                    going to happen during this four-hour visit—we had gotten to know these guys
                    fairly well. I had had some experience with the Secret Service during the 1966
                    visit by President Johnson to Manila for the seven-nation conference on Vietnam
                    of the troop contributing countries. I wasn't particularly daunted by these
                    Secret Service guys.</p>
                <p>Mike Rives sort of bawled out the Secret Service guys for the “heavy-handed way”
                    in which they had handled the [Agnew] visit. For example, when Agnew “trooped
                    the [Cambodian] honor guard line,” off camera the Secret Service was “covering”
                    the honor guard with submachine guns. Another Secret Service guy, with a drawn
                    Uzi submachine gun, sat behind the acting [Cambodian] Chief of State at lunch!
                    When they took Vice President Agnew on a tour of the Royal Palace, Sihanouk's
                    palace, and led him into a room that hadn't been scheduled for a visit, the
                    Secret Service got all excited. They unceremoniously pushed Mike Rives out of
                    the way because he was in the line of fire. They literally shoved him out of the
                    way and charged around with drawn submachine guns.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Mike Rives was very upset about this. He said, “You [Secret Service] guys come to
                    town and leave me with the pieces to pick up. You know, I've got to work with
                    these people.” This was the Cambodian honor guard which had received
                    [international] luminaries such as Zhou En-lai, Tito, Castro, and people like
                    that. They weren't exactly “slouches” in terms of protecting people. Mike said,
                    “Don't you think that I'm interested in the security of the Vice President of
                    the United States?” I'll never forget what the Secret Service guy said. He said,
                    “I don't give a damn. All these guys have got their hands out, anyhow.” In
                    effect, he was saying, “Screw you, Mr. charg� d'affaires.”</p>
                <p>We learned subsequently that the Secret Service went back to Washington and told
                    Vice President Agnew, “You know what that guy in Phnom Penh said about your
                    visit? He said, 'Agnew comes to town and leaves me with the pieces to pick up.'”
                    Well, that remark really tore it, as far as Mike Rives was concerned. The State
                    Department was told [by the White House, “Get rid of this guy [Mike Rives].”</p>
                <p>So he had all of these strikes against him, despite doing his job. Anyway, it was
                    an object lesson. I learned, “Boy, it doesn't take much to screw up.” If you get
                    crossways with these guys, they can cut your throat, and you don't even know it
                    happened. So Mike Rives was given the Distinguished Honor Award of the State
                    Department and was transferred to INR [Bureau of Intelligence Research] to cover
                    African affairs. Marshall Green [Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian
                    Affairs] told me, when I went back in June, 1970, to pick up my family that
                    Rives was in trouble and that he [Marshall] had been ordered to “fire him.”
                    However, Marshall was trying to avoid doing this.</p>
                <p>When Coby Swank was appointed Ambassador to Cambodia, Bill Sullivan [Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs] told me that Coby, who had
                    been Bill Sullivan's DCM [Deputy Chief of Mission] in Laos at the time of the
                    beginning of the “Secret War” in Cambodia in 1964, was his choice to be
                    Ambassador to Cambodia. Despite Coby Swank's being a Soviet specialist and
                    although he had served in China in 1946 as a soldier and later on in Laos with
                    Bill Sullivan, he really had had little Foreign Service Asian experience.
                    However, Coby offered Mike Rives the job of DCM in Phnom Penh, to serve under
                    him. Mike accepted the offer. Mike had had hopes that he would be appointed
                    Ambassador to Cambodia, but at that time that sort of thing almost never
                    happened. Charg�s d'Affaires were not usually upgraded and appointed
                    Ambassadors. We're doing that more frequently now. It makes a certain amount of
                    sense, actually, for an officer who is knowledgeable about the country to be
                    appointed Ambassador.</p>
                <p>However, Mike's days in Phnom Penh were numbered, because very shortly thereafter
                    Tom Enders was appointed to be the DCM in Phnom Penh. Tom had his own “friends
                    in high places,” but Tom was in trouble on his own. He was about to be kicked
                    out of Yugoslavia, because he had had his difficulties with the Ambassador
                    there. Anyway, Tom was “larger than life” when he came out to be DCM. Mike was
                    relieved from duty and moved sideways to INR, to a “nothing” job, because the
                    position was later abolished.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Mike ultimately replaced Tom Corcoran as Laos-Cambodia Country Director, sort of
                    over the objections of the White House. People in the NSC [National Security
                    Council] staff, had also developed a bias against Mike Rives. One such FSO, now
                    a senior ambassador, complained to me at the time of my own assignment as desk
                    officer for Cambodia that the NSC staff really didn't like having Mike Rives
                    appointed as Country Director for Laos-Cambodia. However, the Personnel people
                    concluded, “Well, the hell with you guys. We're going to take care of 'our'
                    guys.”</p>
                <p>So I think that there was a perception that Mike Rives had been “shafted.” You
                    can probably say that Mike hadn't been very “clever” about the way he handled
                    himself. I'll make a kind of philosophic observation. Here we Foreign Service
                    Officers train ourselves on how to observe and analyze what's going on in
                    foreign countries, but we don't do a very good job of analyzing how our own
                    government operates and what it takes to “operate” within our own government.
                    You really have to be smart and clever about this kind of thing.</p>
                <p>Taking the kind of “absolute” positions which Mike Rives did was not helpful.
                    Here is another example of what he did to “anger” the “establishment” in
                    Vietnam. Before we had satellite communications between the United States and
                    Vietnam, they had a “tropospheric scatterer” system. What happens is that you
                    “bounce” the sound or radio wave off the tropospheric layer of space downwards.
                    In effect, it's a kind of satellite communications. That's what we were using at
                    that time, in 1970. The Embassy in Saigon very much wanted to establish a
                    “tropospheric scatterer” unit [in Cambodia] for its own communications. Mike
                    Rives was against it. He said, “We should communicate by telegram so that we'll
                    have a paper record of what's going on.” He continued, “Too many things get
                    decided over the telephone, and there's no record of the decision.” That's a
                    very interesting principle to fight for, but not to fight and die for. This
                    issue was one of those “white birch stakes” which was sharpened and driven into
                    his heart.</p>
                <p>Mike Rives was really fighting the system. I think that he also fought the idea
                    of rearming the Cambodians with anything more than AK-47's which we could buy
                    from the Indonesians or whatever we collected on the battlefield in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember that the Department really made an effort at
                        the time of the Cambodian “incursion.” I was in Saigon. They went around and
                        collected all of the AK-47's they could find.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Hanging up on the wall?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As souvenirs. Actually, I wanted one. It happened that
                        just at that time I was told, “We're sorry but we're collecting all of them
                        to send up to Cambodia.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That's right. In fact, I think that we bought about 40,000 AK-47's from
                    Indonesia. But that wasn't enough. The big problem in supplying the Cambodians
                    with these weapons was the ammunition supply. We would have had to set up an
                    ammunition factory. It really became simpler to re-equip the Cambodians with
                    M-16's, M-1's, and other American equipment, for which we had an ammunition
                    supply. I remember all of that.</p>
                <p>In fact, the guy who was selected to run the “Secret War” in Cambodia, which
                    never really got off the ground because of the Cooper-Church amendment, was a
                    guy named Jonathan (”Fred”) Ladd. Fred Ladd was a retired U. S. Army colonel. We
                    became very good friends. I met him in the State Department in Washington in
                    June, 1970, when I went back to collect my family.</p>
                <p>When it became clear that we weren't going to be “shot out” of Phnom Penh and
                    that there was a job in the Embassy there for me, Mike Rives said that he wanted
                    me to be assigned to the Embassy as a Political Officer. He said, “Look, you've
                    got two weeks to go back home and bring your family back.” I tried to do it and
                    almost succeeded in doing it. I flew home and collected my wife and infant son.
                    She was pleased enough. She didn't want to stay in Washington by herself.
                    Fortunately, we hadn't unpacked most of our effects, so we threw it all back in
                    the lift van and left town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go through Saigon when you moved to Phnom
                        Penh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I don't think so. We flew directly to Phnom Penh from Hong Kong if
                    memory serves. We were permitted to have our families in Phnom Penh. [In
                    Washington] Tom Corcoran had introduced me to Fred Ladd. Ladd had commanded the
                    Fifth Special Forces Group in Vietnam, until the time of the “Tet” offensive of
                    1968. He went back to Washington and retired from the Army after that, in 1969.
                    He went down to Florida to open up a charter fishing business. Fred was very
                    well known in the Army “establishment.” His Father had been a regular army Major
                    General and he had attended but was washed out of West Point. He attended OCS in
                    the Second World War. He was very close to senior General officers like Fred
                    Weyand and Creighton Abrams. He was mentioned in David Halberstam's book, “The
                    Best and the Brightest” as one of those people who had spoken up early in our
                    Mission in Saigon, saying that the corruption of the Vietnamese was going to do
                    us in, if we didn't handle things right. Ladd had had a lot of career experience
                    in special operations, running around with the Kurds in Iraq, riding camels, and
                    that sort of stuff. He had also served as military assistant to Secretary of the
                    Army Wilbur Brucker back in the late 1950's.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Interestingly enough, Fred Ladd and Al Haig had been aides de camp to Gen.
                    MacArthur at the time of the Inchon invasion during the Korean War [1950]. Fred
                    was a captain and was senior aide. Al Haig was a first lieutenant and was the
                    junior aide. So Ladd's relationship with Al Haig went way back over twenty
                    years. It was Al Haig who decided that we needed somebody to run a “Secret War”
                    in Cambodia. He felt that Mike Rives, was not the man to do it. Haig persuaded
                    Ladd to come back into the government, in the State Department, as a Foreign
                    Service Reserve [FSR] officer Class Two and to be the Political-Military
                    Counselor in the Embassy in Phnom Penh.</p>
                <p>I remember Tom Corcoran's specifying to Mike Rives at that point that Ladd, as an
                    FSR-2, would be the next most senior officer after Rives. However, Ladd was
                    never to be left as Charg� d'Affaires of the Embassy. The State Department was
                    going to remain in control of the Embassy. Well, Fred Ladd really didn't know an
                    awful lot about the Foreign Service. He really wasn't an “empire builder” at all
                    but he was a “results-oriented” kind of guy. He firmly believed that the only
                    way to succeed in a situation like the one we had on our hands in Cambodia was
                    not to repeat what we had done in Vietnam but, in fact, to set up a kind of
                    Special Forces operation to harass the communists on their own turf. He felt
                    that building a large, “main force” operation as we had done in Vietnam, would
                    create enormous problems for ourselves, including corruption, which would be our
                    undoing and which we were very familiar with, based on what had happened in
                    Korea, China, and Greece.</p>
                <p>Fred Ladd was a “can-do” kind of man. He knew everyone in authority in Saigon and
                    could “interface” with the Saigon brass very well. He had access to Gen Weyand,
                    who was then Deputy Commander of MACV and became Commander of MACV after Gen
                    Abrams left Saigon to become Chief of Staff of the Army after Westmoreland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gen. Weyand was later the Chief of Staff of the U. S.
                        Army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. Ladd was “well wired” into the system. We in the Embassy in Phnom
                    Penh got as much out of MACV in terms of materiel as anybody could reasonably
                    get. This was at the same time that Admiral John McCain, who was CINCPAC
                    [Commander in Chief, Pacific], decided, “By God, Cambodia is going to be under
                    ME.” He said, “I am going to run things in Cambodia, not MACV.”</p>
                <p>So the line of authority went directly to Ladd from CINCPAC. In fact, Admiral
                    McCain came to Cambodia a couple of times while I was there. It was probably a
                    mistake to have CINCPAC running the Cambodian war. The military support aspect,
                    if not the strategic aspect of our whole effort in Cambodia should have been run
                    out of Vietnam. But we had this other layer of CINCPAC running things.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>That's where we were in the fall of 1970, when it was decided that Cambodia was
                    going to survive. The Nixon administration was going to draw on all of the
                    military assistance programs, worldwide, to find money to support Cambodia. Over
                    the shrill screams of everybody in the world, like Israel, Greece, and God knows
                    where else we were giving money to. We had to support Cambodia.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Deputy Director of P/M [Office of Political- Military Affairs in the
                    State Department] at that time, was Tom Pickering [later Director General of the
                    Foreign Service and Ambassador to the UN and to the Soviet Union]. He was
                    another very bright and upcoming officer who was a classmate of Tom Enders. They
                    had competed ferociously throughout their careers. These two people were just
                    larger than life. They were so smart that they made your teeth hurt! Pickering
                    found the money in the worldwide military assistant program (MAP) to give to
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>By the fall of 1970 we had a limited operation going on in Cambodia. There was no
                    “Secret War.” We were limited to 200 Americans in country at any given time. We
                    were getting military assistance for the Cambodians, who were getting out and
                    conducting some operations, but they turned out, for the most part,
                    disastrously. In October 1970, they had the “Chenla” operation, a
                    multi-battalion effort directed up Route 6 to try to open up the road to Kampong
                    Thom and Siem Reap. Of course, the Cambodian Army walked right into a divisional
                    sized North Vietnamese ambush. It reminded me of General Braddock and the French
                    and Indian War [1755]. The Cambodians were really clobbered. They lost 13,000
                    men. It set the Cambodians back very seriously. They lost a lot of the hard-won
                    ammunition and equipment that we had given them.</p>
                <p>The another blow fell in December, 1970, when Viet Cong “sappers” attacked
                    Pochentong Airport in Phnom Penh and blew up every airplane there. They also
                    blew up the ammunition that was being delivered at the airport. The whole thing
                    was such a fiasco that Gen Lon Nol had a stroke because of the stress of that
                    moment.</p>
                <p>The Viet Cong probably did us a favor by blowing up all of these old airplanes
                    because Lon Nol had the damndest collection of aircraft that you ever saw. He
                    had MiG-17's, French Fouga-Mystere jets, and a whole collection of “junk,” none
                    of which was much good for close air support of the Cambodian Army. Because of
                    the loss of all of this equipment and supplies we started delivering some
                    helicopters, with the cooperation of the Vietnamese. Also, we started giving
                    them some T-28 trainers, which had been turned into excellent close support
                    aircraft. They were very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're saying that Lon Nol got rid of all of these old
                        aircraft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: All of the aircraft that they had been given by the French, Russians
                    and Chinese over the years. In effect, it was a blessing.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andy, I'd like to go back to an earlier period. You were
                        sent to Phnom Penh on April 27, 1970. You were told to “find out what's
                        really happening.” We're talking about a situation where you had to “hit the
                        ground running.” You knew about Cambodia, but this was not your “beat.” One
                        of the things that I'm trying to do with these oral histories is to pass on
                        information on how to do things like this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Tradecraft. I think I can tell you. Here's an interesting little
                    anecdote about that. I told you that I had volunteered to go to Vietnam in the
                    first place. I figured that was the only way that I was going to get a political
                    reporting assignment. I was one of those who felt that I had to try this. I
                    didn't really know what the Foreign Service was all about. I'd joined the
                    service before we had the “cone” system. I didn't particularly like the “cone”
                    system. In fact, I was dead set against it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “cone” system involved your area of specialization in
                        the service. The “cones” included administrative, political, economic, and
                        consular.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. I remember that when I was in Kobe, U. Alexis Johnson became
                    Ambassador to Japan. He had been Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
                    and President of AFSA [American Foreign Service Association] at that time. We're
                    talking of 1966. Ambassador Johnson came down to Kobe for a visit to the
                    Consulate. Another officer named Charley Duffy, an economic officer who later
                    resigned from the Foreign Service, and I spoke to Ambassador Johnson at a
                    reception held for him and Mrs. Johnson. I had known U. Alexis a little, because
                    Steve Johnson, their son, was a class behind me in the Foreign Service. We'd
                    been part of the Washington junior officer crowd. Afterwards, we were in Saigon
                    together. I had known Ambassador Johnson on a personal level. I said to U.
                    Alexis, with Charley Duffy, that we didn't think that it made a lot of sense to
                    have this “cone” system. I hadn't joined the Foreign Service to do just one
                    thing the rest of my career. One of the reasons that I had joined the Foreign
                    Service was to avoid doing just one thing throughout my career.</p>
                <p>It was clear to me that I was doing very well as a consular officer. I'd gotten
                    two promotions in succeeding years and I really did like consular work but I
                    wanted to try something else. I felt that if I were put “on a peg,” so to speak,
                    I would never get to do anything else. I didn't feel that I would advance to my
                    greatest capacity.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>Anyway, I volunteered to go to Vietnam to do political reporting. I had learned a
                    little political reporting in Douala [Cameroon], when I served as acting
                    Principal Officer for four months. I spent a lot of time doing political
                    analysis on the ruling political party in West Cameroon. In my graduate studies,
                    political analysis was my “bag.” So I wasn't exactly a neophyte. My biggest
                    problem in political reporting was learning how to do it and learning how to
                    write. Writing was the biggest problem that I had. That's something that you
                    only learn after you get into this business. Being a journalist doesn't exactly
                    prepare you to be a good Political Officer.</p>
                <p>I did “hit the ground running” [in Phnom Penh]. One of the things that I was
                    asked to do was to go to the military press briefing every morning and find out
                    what was going on. Of course, all of the journalists were there. Some of them
                    would go out in cars and look at the war, which could be very dangerous and very
                    injurious to your health. In fact, during the first year of the Cambodian War,
                    17 journalists were killed. They went out to look at the war and never came
                    back—ambushed by the Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Khmer Rouges.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No, they were Viet Cong [operating in Cambodia]. There were very few
                    Khmer Rouges at that time. They were really not militarily active. I am
                    persuaded that the people that they ran into were Viet Cong, who weren't about
                    to let Western journalists tell the world that they were captured by Vietnamese
                    on Cambodian soil. The journalists may have been handed over to the Khmer Rouges
                    for captivity or other disposition, but I think that they were captured by the
                    Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>I would go down to the briefings and find out what was going on. We would get
                    bits and pieces of reports from all and sundry and would go back and write this
                    up in a daily “sitrep” [situation report]. I started to expand my horizons a
                    little bit. As I said previously, I was the first American diplomat to go to the
                    Cambodian National Assembly since the overthrow of Sihanouk. I introduced myself
                    and met the people there. You may recall that it was the National Assembly which
                    actually overthrew Sihanouk. They're the people who changed the constitution and
                    said, “He's out.” They created the Cambodian Republic. The acting President of
                    the National Assembly was In Tam. He was also Governor of the province of
                    Kampong Cham, Northeast of Phnom Penh, in the rubber plantation country. The
                    province itself is bisected by the Mekong River. East of the Mekong River was
                    very much “Apache country” [communist controlled]. Kampong Cham town, the
                    province town, which is on the West bank of the Mekong River, was the scene of
                    several very heavy battles. This governor, who was a career Ministry of the
                    Interior type, had police experience and training. I came to the conclusion that
                    he was probably the best trained military guy that they had, since he was about
                    the only one putting up an effective fight against the communists. He was
                    actually holding his own.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>He would drive down from Kampong Cham to Phnom Penh, down Route 6, every couple
                    of days, to attend to the business of the National Assembly. We became very good
                    friends, dating from those very first days in May 1970. Of course, I also got to
                    know a lot of other people in the National Assembly. I started to pick up bits
                    and pieces concerning what made Cambodia “tick.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: French was the language you used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: French was the language. You didn't need to speak Cambodian [at the
                    time]. That came later. Just like in Saigon. You didn't need to speak Vietnamese
                    for dealing with the Foreign Ministry. So the [Cambodian] National Assembly
                    became my “beat.” In that way I got a lot of inside “dope” on what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>In Tam, the President of the National Assembly, became quite a political power.
                    In fact, he ran for the presidency in 1972. It was stolen from him by Lon Nol,
                    and we let Lon Nol get away with it. In Tam really had been “my” candidate to be
                    president. Had he become president, I think that the Cambodians would have put
                    up a much better fight. But it was problematic, and the White House—and
                    particularly Al Haig—were very concerned that if we “lost” Lon Nol, the military
                    who were beholden to him might disintegrate. Given what had happened to
                    [President Ngo dinh] Diem and the dynamic of what had happened [in 1963 and
                    subsequently in South Vietnam], nobody wanted to fool around with the situation
                    in Cambodia. So we let Lon Nol get away with stealing the 1972 election.</p>
                <p>At any rate, there were lots of to-ing and fro-ing politically, and In Tam became
                    “my” source. In fact, I even had a big “to do” with the Agency [the CIA] when
                    they tried to recruit In Tam and put him on their payroll. I found out about it
                    when In Tam told me that he'd been visited by an Embassy officer who had offered
                    him medical treatment in Laos and all of that sort of thing. I went storming
                    back to the Embassy to see John Stein, [the CIA Chief of Station and] my
                    colleague at the “flea bag hotel” in April, 1970. I told him, “Look, we don't
                    have to pay a nickel for this guy. He tells me everything we want to know. In
                    fact, if he's put on your payroll, he'll be discredited, in my view. I'm mad as
                    hell that you're trying to take over 'my' contact.” John Stein backed off. The
                    guy who had been assigned to recruit In Tam, Tom Ahern, was one of the guys
                    later captured in Iran [when the Embassy in Tehran was taken over in 1979]. He
                    was an Agency guy who spent 444 days as a “guest” of the Ayatollah Khomeini. He
                    had a German wife named Gisella. Our families were great friends. We had been in
                    Saigon at the same time. Our wives were friends in Bangkok, where they were
                    “safe havened.”</p>
                <p>Tom was just doing his job. I said, “Look, this is 'my' contact. I developed him,
                    and he's going to be 'mine' as long as I'm around [Phnom Penh].”</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>[During my time in Phnom Penh] a daughter of Sihanouk was still there—I think her
                    name was Bopha Devi. She was a classical Khmer Ballet dancer. She was arrested
                    by the new Cambodian Government and put on trial. We in the Embassy decided that
                    convicting her would not be useful. It would make Sihanouk look like a hero in
                    various quarters if his daughter was “railroaded” into jail. I used to attend
                    her trial, just to demonstrate that the American Embassy was very interested in
                    this matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is how one influences a situation, in a way...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. I didn't say, “Look, damn it, let her go,” but I made it very
                    clear that we were concerned about what was going on. The Cambodian authorities
                    got the message very clearly.</p>
                <p>You may remember that in 1969 an American merchant ship, the “Columbia Eagle,”
                    which was carrying munitions...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Heavens, I remember that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The “Columbia Eagle.” We had a program in Phnom Penh in 1970 called,
                    “Take a mutineer to lunch.” Two mutineers had taken over the ship and were
                    imprudent enough to do this about the time when Sihanouk was overthrown. They
                    took the ship into Sihanoukville and found that they had taken it into the wrong
                    country. [The Cambodian authorities] put these guys into a Navy jail on the
                    Mekong River. The Cambodian authorities were really kind of fed up with these
                    guys by May, 1970. They didn't want them. They used to take them out to lunch
                    from time to time and during one outing one of them escaped. They never saw him
                    again. We figured that the Khmer Rouges caught him and killed him. The other guy
                    was mentally unbalanced. I can't remember his name exactly. Perhaps it was
                    Glatkowski. I've got it in my files somewhere. He may still be in custody. A U.
                    S. court had asked for his arrest. U. S. Marshals were flown into Phnom Penh to
                    pick him up.</p>
                <p>During the time this was being set up, Blackburn and I “entertained” this guy to
                    make sure that he didn't get lost. We had this program, “Take a mutineer to
                    lunch.” We used to feed him. We took him out to the airport to deliver him to
                    the Marshals. They never got off the airplane. I suppose that there was some
                    legal consideration in that, that they were still on American territory, in a
                    sense. We bundled this clown on the aircraft, and he was taken back to the U.S.
                    You were probably involved in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the ship was hijacked, I think that it was carrying
                        napalm...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: And “iron” bombs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was on its way to Thailand. I remember that everybody
                        was chasing around. I think that was the only time I ever met Admiral
                        Zumwalt in Cambodia. He was working up a scheme to get this ship. Then, when
                        the ship was picked up, just after the Cambodian “incursion” in May, 1970,
                        one of my U. S. Coast Guard officers—because I had a Coast Guard detachment
                        attached to the Consulate—came in and said, “The South Vietnamese Navy
                        people say that they know where these guys are. Do you want them 'taken care
                        of'?” I said, “Good God, no.” That's what they were talking about—killing
                        them. I guess that he felt that I could just wave my hand and say, “Do
                        what's necessary...”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: And have them “terminated with extreme prejudice.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I was mad as hell about it. I said, “Tell the South
                        Vietnamese Navy, 'No, no, no.' Stay out of this affair.” Just to finish this
                        story off and to satisfy my own curiosity, what were they trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that it was basically an “anti-war statement.” They were just a
                    couple of kooks. One of them, I swear, was mentally unbalanced. They were a
                    couple of disreputable characters. They weren't old guys and really weren't very
                    smart. How they got away with it—I don't remember the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The ship was released very quickly. The Cambodian authorities just took
                    these two guys into custody. The ship and the rest of the crew were released. I
                    never met them. Of course, I didn't get down to Sihanoukville to see the ship
                    when it was there. It was gone by the time I got to Cambodia at the end of
                    April, 1970. These two guys were still in jail. I had had some experience with
                    people captured in Cambodia when I was in Vietnam. We had two instances that I
                    dealt with, when I was the “border incident” guy.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>One case involved a U. S. Army LCI [Landing Craft, Infantry] which went up the
                    Bassac River en route to Can Tho [South Vietnam] or some place like that. It was
                    traveling inside the IV Corps area with a crew of 21 on board. They had a few
                    cases of beer. I guess they all got “bombed out of their minds” somewhat and
                    sailed right up the Bassac River and into Cambodia. They were seized by a
                    Cambodian gunboat. I remember that General Abrams [then commander of MACV] was
                    mad as hell that this had happened. I used to get this information from Army
                    lieutenants who handled Cambodian affairs. They used to sit “behind the screen”
                    [against which slides were projected] at MACV briefings. So they heard
                    everything and they would pass it on to me. It was just as if I had attended the
                    MACV staff meeting.</p>
                <p>They told me that the Rear Admiral who was Commander of Naval Forces
                    Vietnam—probably Zumwalt's predecessor, because this was about 1968—said, “Well,
                    it wasn't one of my ships. This was an Army LCI.” General Abrams erupted and
                    said, “No, God damn it, it was one of mine. How the hell did this happen?” It
                    had a forklift on it to handle crates, POL [Petroleum and Other Lubricants], and
                    stuff like that.</p>
                <p>Sihanouk kept the crew of the LCI for a fairly long time before he finally
                    released them. He arranged to have them treated them quite well. Now and then
                    they would be taken to “floating brothels” for feminine companionship and they
                    would be taken to lunch. Sihanouk arranged to have a white, tropical suit made
                    for each one of them. When they were repatriated, they came off the plane
                    wearing these white suits! The U. S. military [in Saigon] didn't know what to
                    make of this.</p>
                <p>The other case was a little more serious. We had these reconnaissance
                    aircraft—[De Haviland] Beaver's [Canadian made]. You remember them—high wing
                    monoplanes. They were loaded with SIGINT [Signals Intercept] equipment. They
                    used to fly up and down the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, listening to enemy
                    tactical communications. On this occasion a Beaver, flying along the Western
                    border of Tay Ninh Province, adjoining Cambodia, was shot down and crashed about
                    one kilometer inside Cambodia. I remember how excited everybody got because it
                    was loaded with all of this equipment. [MACV] called in an air strike on it and
                    blew the plane up. The pilot and crew were captured by the Cambodians.
                    Fortunately for the aircrew, the Cambodians beat the Viet Cong to the scene.
                    They took them to Phnom Penh. I don't think that anybody really realized what
                    these guys were or that they were quite important from the technical point of
                    view. They could have ended up in the Soviet Union, for all of that. We finally
                    managed to get them back.</p>
                <p>That was part of my job [in Saigon], keeping in contact with the Australian
                    Embassy [during the time when the U. S. Embassy in Phnom Penh was closed, and
                    Australia was the “protecting power.”], the Canadian Delegation to the ICC
                    [International Control Commission] and all of that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Getting back to your service as a Political Officer at the
                        Embassy in Phnom Penh, could you talk a little more about the international
                        press there, which was all over the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Of course, Cambodia was “the” story at the time. During the fall of
                    1970 the reporters were distracted by the civil war in Pakistan, which led to
                    the establishment of Bangladesh. But for three or four months Cambodia was “the”
                    story. Everybody was waiting to see the Vietnamese communists march into Phnom
                    Penh. It all quieted down after we ended the Cambodian “incursion” and President
                    Nixon was seen to have kept his word that this was an “incursion” and not an
                    “invasion.”</p>
                <p>The international press were a mixed bag of people. I had a pretty good
                    relationship with a number of them whom I had known in Saigon where I had
                    occasion to brief them. One such was Francois Sully who wrote for UPI and was
                    killed in a helicopter crash in 1971 with Vietnamese General Do Cao Tri, the III
                    Corps commander. He was a pretty good journalist and had been a very good
                    contact of mine in Saigon. He understood the war and what it was all about, so
                    we had a good relationship. There were others. The New York Times reporter,
                    Henry Kamm had a political ax to grind, as did the AP [Associated Press]
                    representative. A lot of the contact between the Embassy and the international
                    press was “confrontational” in tone. It was our side versus their side. These
                    guys were out to embarrass the Nixon administration, and they certainly
                    embarrassed the Cambodians, who weren't doing all of that well in the field.For
                    example, there were the atrocities that took place—on “our” side. One of the
                    habits that the Cambodian Government people had, when they killed a Vietnamese,
                    was to cut out his liver and eat it—raw—to ensure that the dead man never went
                    to Vietnamese heaven, or whatever. [They believed that] his soul would wander
                    eternally. Or they would decapitate bodies of prisoners, and people would walk
                    around with these heads. That became a big controversy. Of course, it is
                    embarrassing when your “clients” act like headhunters. Then there was the “child
                    soldier” issue. The press would become aware of the fact that there were
                    13-year-old Cambodian Government soldiers, carrying AK-47 rifles. This was a big
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember seeing pictures of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Anything that was embarrassing to the Cambodians, of course, was an
                    embarrassment to us. It's funny how “what goes around, comes around.” You
                    remember Moose and Lowenstein?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Jim Lowenstein and Dick Moose, both former Foreign Service Officers who
                    resigned from the Foreign Service and went to work for Senator Fulbright as
                    investigators. This was when the staffs of Congressional Committees began to be
                    expanded. Moose, of course, was from Arkansas. Lowenstein was probably from New
                    York. Moose and I had never served together, but we had both been in Cameroon
                    [at one time or another]. I think he served with Walt Cutler, when they were
                    very young officers and we had just opened up the Embassy in Cameroon.</p>
                <p>When Moose and Lowenstein came to Phnom Penh, they were out looking for all of
                    the “dirt”—whatever they could find to feed to Senator Fulbright to “flay” the
                    Nixon administration with, such as the treatment of refugees or the failure to
                    take care of refugees. The fact that we were doing very little for the Cambodian
                    refugees was an embarrassment. In 1972 I had to testify before Senator Edward
                    Kennedy's Refugee Subcommittee on our treatment of refugees in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Of course, Moose and Lowenstein weren't particularly welcome in the Embassy at
                    any time. They knew it and figured that they were “going to get the ball in play
                    anyway,” so they spent most of their time in Phnom Penh talking to the press.
                    They'd get all of the “dirt” from the press and then would go back to Washington
                    and feed this into the system. Then Senator Fulbright could take the
                    administration to task.</p>
                <p>It was ironic that one thing that some of the journalists would do on Saturday
                    evenings was to have “couscous” [North African barbecue] parties. The trouble
                    was that the “couscous” was laced with “hemp” [marijuana], and they'd all get a
                    “buzz” on—they'd all go ga-ga. Moose and Lowenstein didn't know this the first
                    time they were invited. The press had a great time feeding them with this
                    marijuana “couscous” and got them “bombed out of their minds.” This was
                    reported. I remember how frantic both of them were to send a cable to the staff
                    director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explain what had happened.
                    [Laughter] We all got a big laugh out of that.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>In fact, a free-lance AP photographer and the AP reporter pulled the same thing
                    on my wife Judy and me. We were invited to the AP guy's house. Judy was pregnant
                    with our second child at that point. There was a young woman from the Singapore
                    Embassy and the two journalists, who were feeling no pain. They were drinking,
                    and I think that they were smoking something. We just said, “Look, we don't do
                    that. Don't feed us anything.” We thought that we knew our hosts well enough so
                    that they would respect our concerns. By the time dinner was served, we were
                    very hungry. We had something like minestrone soup, and I ate everything. But
                    the “spinach” turned out to be marijuana. I got “bombed out of my mind.” The
                    young woman from the Singapore Embassy was much worse affected. She became
                    hysterical and very frightened. The two journalists who gave the party were
                    having a hell of a time. They were laughing their heads off. Judy and I drove
                    the Singapore woman home. Then we decided to go back to the party. The effects
                    hadn't hit us yet, for some reason or other, the way they had hit the young
                    woman from the Singapore Embassy. We thought that she was nuts, or something. It
                    seemed like a nice party, and we liked these two guys. It was a mistake to go
                    back to the house, because it didn't take very long before the effects of the
                    marijuana hit us. It's a wonder that we got home in one piece. I was mad as hell
                    that they would do this to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was very common. The Cambodians used marijuana on a recreational
                    basis. They would collapse in the afternoon in their hammocks and smoke a
                    “joint.” They felt that this was no problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression—or the Embassy's impression—of
                        Lon Nol and his coterie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that those of us who had to deal with the problem of Vietnam
                    had contempt for him. Maybe “contempt” is too harsh a word. I think that we
                    really understood his limitations. He really was a limited individual. He wasn't
                    all of that smart. He was clever, to a certain extent. He was experienced. He
                    had basically been a policeman during most of his career. He had worked for the
                    French and had been “around the track” a number of times—Prime Minister,
                    Minister of Defense, and all of that. And now he had himself proclaimed
                    “President of the Republic of Cambodia.”</p>
                <p>However, his heart attack in late 1970 really limited him. We flew him to Hawaii
                    for treatment. We thought that this would allow us to arrange for a real change
                    of government and get a stronger hand to run the Cambodian military. It was
                    quite clear that it was all going to be “downhill” if we didn't get the
                    Cambodian military under control. However, in April, 1971, he came back to
                    Cambodia. The heart attack had crippled him, but he was still functioning, to
                    some extent. Of course, the Cambodian military wanted him back, because they had
                    their “feeding frenzy” in the U. S. aid program.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>His younger brother, Lon Non, became a real “shit disturber.” That's the only
                    term I can think of to describe this guy. I am convinced that he was the guy who
                    started the trouble in March, 1970 in Phnom Penh—the anti-Vietnamese
                    demonstrations which got out of hand. They resulted in the sacking of the PRG
                    [Provisional Revolutionary Government—the Viet Cong] and the North Vietnamese
                    Embassies. This created the situation in which the communists withdrew
                    diplomatically and set off the attack on the Cambodians. In other words, he
                    altered the status quo in Cambodia to bring the Americans in. He and his little
                    coterie succeeded in doing that.</p>
                <p>The group around him included some Cham's. These were Muslims from northeastern
                    Cambodia. He controlled the 15th Infantry Brigade, the largest unit in the
                    Cambodian Army. It was not supported under MAP [U. S. Military Assistance
                    Program]. We would not support it militarily because he would not observe the
                    requirements that we levied on him, in terms of operations, strength, unit size,
                    accountability, and all of that. Since he was “the first one at the trough,” he
                    had this enormous brigade which did very little fighting and which was very
                    obviously created to be the Palace Guard. We felt that this guy was a real
                    problem. He had been the “point man” in spoiling In Tam's run for the presidency
                    in 1972.</p>
                <p>This was very clear. I used to make a point of going to In Tam's house very
                    openly to see him, because I knew that Lon Non's guys were watching. I wanted
                    them to understand that the U. S. Embassy was very much interested in In Tam. He
                    was, in effect, under the Embassy's protection. I even brought my son with me on
                    these visits. In Tam kept a monkey up a tree. My son liked to go and play with
                    the monkey.</p>
                <p>In late 1972 or early 1973, after I had become Cambodia desk officer in
                    Washington, we started getting CIA reports that Lon Non was talking about
                    staging a coup d'etat against his brother and taking control of the Cambodian
                    Government. I remember writing a memorandum to Bill Sullivan [then Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs], through Mike Rives, who
                    was the Country Director for Laos and Cambodia. I analyzed the situation and
                    concluded that Lon Non was fully capable of making a coup attempt. From what I
                    knew about him, he was going to present us with a “fait accompli,” as he did in
                    1970, and we would be “stuck” with him. He would become “our bastard.” I didn't
                    think that he was smart enough to be “our bastard.” It was bad enough to have
                    the onus for starting something like that, but he really wasn't smart enough to
                    pull it off. I recommended that we “get rid of him.” I recommended that we tell
                    Marshal Lon Nol—he had not only made himself President but also Marshal of the
                    Cambodian Army—that his brother had “to go.” Obviously, we were not in the
                    business of assassinating people any more, but somebody had to find a way to get
                    rid of certain difficult people, somehow.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Interestingly enough, Marshall Green [Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian
                    Affairs] approved the memorandum I wrote on the status of Lon Non. I saw the
                    copy he had signed. It was decided that someone would go to Phnom Penh to tell
                    Lon Nol this. Bill Sullivan decided that Al Haig was to be the messenger. Al
                    Haig had just left the White House and the NSC. He had just received his fourth
                    star [had become a four-star general] and was then Vice Chief of Staff of the U.
                    S. Army. Haig didn't particularly want to go, but he was Lon Nol's “buddy,” so
                    Bill Sullivan said, “You've got to go and do this, because you have enough
                    prestige so that Marshal Lon Nol will accept this.” Haig was President Nixon's
                    friend, and all of that.</p>
                <p>There was then the question of who from the State Department was to go to
                    Cambodia with Al Haig on this mission. The first choice was Walt Cutler, who was
                    then Bill Sullivan's Special Assistant. I think that Roger Kirk had gone on to
                    be Ambassador to Somalia or some such place. However, Walt was getting a divorce
                    from his wife. He felt that he had traveled enough with Bill Sullivan—to Paris
                    and so forth. He said, “No, I don't think that I want to go. Antippas wrote the
                    damned memorandum. Let him go.” I was not Al Haig's first choice. He didn't
                    remember me from meeting him in Phnom Penh in early May, 1970 or subsequently in
                    Phnom Penh again in 1972. When we took Haig out to the airport at the end of
                    this May, 1970 visit. I told Him as I had Admiral Zumwalt, “I don't know whether
                    we're going to be shot out of Phnom Penh, but do you have any jobs on the NSC
                    staff?” He said, “Well, we have a really small staff. but if you don't have
                    anything in hand when you come home, come and see me.” The point of this was
                    that at this stage of my life I was keeping my options open.</p>
                <p>By this time it was late March or early April, 1973. Fred Ladd had left Phnom
                    Penh and was working in P/M [Political-Military Affairs], but with a special
                    responsibility to keep the Secretary of State informed about what was going on
                    in Cambodia. This was before Henry Kissinger “pushed” William Rogers out of the
                    position of Secretary of State and assumed that position himself. This was at
                    the height of the “secret bombing” of Cambodia—or “not so secret bombing” of
                    Cambodia. The debate in Congress on the War Powers Act was just building up.
                    Fred Ladd's job was to go over to the Pentagon and find out “who was bombing
                    who” and come back and report to Secretary of State Rogers.</p>
                <p>At that point we were being cut off from circulation of what they used to call,
                    “The Yellow Peril.” This was a book with yellow covers published daily which
                    reported all of the bombing strikes which took place in Vietnam and elsewhere.
                    Because the White House was so paranoid about “leaks”. The State Department was
                    cut off from distribution of “The Yellow Peril.” Even the Secretary of State
                    didn't know whom we were bombing at this point. Ladd used to go over to the
                    Pentagon and find out what was going on. He and I had retained a friendly
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>At the same time I had thrown this other issue into the pot, that we had to get
                    rid of Lon Nol's little brother. Ladd persuaded General Haig to take me along on
                    this trip to Phnom Penh. However, Haig did not accept me because I was the most
                    knowledgeable on Cambodia, because I wrote the memorandum, or anything like
                    that. The way that Ladd persuaded him was to say, “You know, Antippas fought in
                    the Korean War” and that I had received a direct commission. It was on those
                    grounds that Haig accepted me.</p>
                <p>I spoke to Haig a little bit during that trip because we went to Bangkok, Nakhon
                    Phenom, Vientiane, Laos, Phnom Penh, and Saigon. There was an effort to
                    camouflage the real purpose of the trip, which was to get rid of Lon Non. During
                    the trip I told Haig, “We desperately need a competent Cambodian Ambassador to
                    the United States to help us talk to Congress. The guy that's there now is an
                    old, French-trained diplomat, whose basic function is to sit there and look
                    ambassadorial. Meanwhile, we're getting our brains beaten in. I've got just the
                    candidate to be Cambodian Ambassador. His name is Um Sim”. Um Sim had been
                    Director, then Minister of Posts and Telegraph. He was a Fulbright Scholar. He
                    went to the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale, IL. in the 50's. He
                    was one of the people I met in Phnom Penh early on and was a good friend of
                    mine. I told Haig, “He's articulate, he understands what the problem is, and he
                    could help us make our case in Washington, which is something that we
                    desperately need.”</p>
                <p>While in Phnom Penh, Haig persuaded Lon Nol not only to get rid of Lon Non but
                    also to appoint Um Sim Cambodian Ambassador to the United States. When we were
                    on the way back to Washington on the Special Mission aircraft, Haig came back to
                    where I was sitting and said, “Well, I got your guy for you.” This was great. I
                    spent the next two years collaborating directly with Um Sim in working the Hill
                    on the AID program and fighting the battle of who was to represent Cambodia in
                    the UN—the Phnom Penh government, Sihanouk, or someone else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back to the time you were in Cambodia from
                        1970 to 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: May, 1970, to February, 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mike Rives the Charg� d'Affaires during the whole time
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No. Mike Rives was Charg� from August, 1969, until Coby Swank arrived
                    in August, 1970. He served as DCM until November, 1970. Tom Enders came in to
                    replace him, and Rives went back to the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Coby Swank deal with matters in Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Swank, of course, is an enormously decent guy. He is a very nice guy—a
                    man whom I have liked and admired from the time of my first assignment in the
                    State Department in 1961, when he was Secretary of State Dean Rusk's senior
                    staff assistant. Here was a guy at the apex of power in the State Department who
                    took time to be very decent. Of course, I'd watched his career since then. He'd
                    been DCM in Laos and later in the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>He was obviously in line to go on to very great things, as he was a Russian
                    specialist. However, I think that he was not the guy for Cambodia, particularly
                    to try to control the U.S. and Cambodian military apparatus. He took great pride
                    in the fact that he didn't have much military background, apart from having been
                    a private first class in the Quartermaster Corps, in Special Services in China,
                    or something like that. He had never fired a shot in anger. He took great pride
                    in that.</p>
                <p>Well, we were dealing with an unusual military apparatus in Cambodia. In such
                    circumstances we needed a guy like Fred Ladd to deal with the Cambodian
                    military, and we certainly needed someone who had the confidence of a guy like
                    Fred Ladd. Tom Enders also had no military background, but he has a very strong
                    personality. He had his marching orders from somebody, presumably Henry
                    Kissinger who had been his professor at Harvard. Tom knew what he was about and
                    was very clear in his own mind. There was no question of who was in charge when
                    Tom Enders was around.</p>
                <p>This is not to say that Coby Swank wasn't in charge, but I think that he really
                    didn't quite understand the “game,” as it was played in Cambodia. Of course, he
                    had had no direct experience in Vietnam, so he didn't understand how that whole
                    mechanism worked. Only those of us who had dealt with it understood the “mind
                    set” of the people we were in contact with.</p>
                <p>I think that the biggest mistake we made [in Vietnam and Cambodia] is that we
                    tolerated the corruption and let the people we supported get away with it. This
                    lost us a lot of support from Congress and from the public more generally.
                    Secondly, there was the unlimited bombing of Cambodia. Of course, the Embassy
                    was found out to be heavily involved in the targeting. In fact, Moose and
                    Lowenstein found out that Tom Enders was heavily involved in the whole system.
                    These two guys found out from journalists with little FM radios bought in Hong
                    Kong which could pick up the communications with the FACs [Forward Air
                    Controllers] from the airport control towers. It was an “open secret” that the
                    U. S. Embassy was running the bombing campaign. That really didn't “play” very
                    well in Congress or elsewhere.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Now, I would say—and this is what I said in my paper at the National War
                    College—that we, the Cambodian Army, obviously needed bombing support. Since the
                    Cambodian Army didn't have much artillery, they needed the Air Force equivalent
                    of flying artillery. But what the U. S. Air Force was doing in Cambodia was just
                    horrendous. It was engaging in “carpet bombing.” I remember that when I
                    accompanied Al Haig to Southeast Asia in the first week of April, 1973, we
                    visited Seventh Air Force headquarters in Thailand. We were standing in the
                    Officers' Club having a drink. By this time I was physically exhausted. Lt. Gen
                    John Vogt, commanding the Seventh Air Force told Haig, as we stood there, “We
                    have reconfigured the B-52-D's. We can carry more 'iron bombs.'</p>
                <p>At that time CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific] Admiral Noel had come out
                    against the “carpet bombing” of Cambodia. I remember General Vogt telling Haig,
                    “Don't let them turn us off. We have to continue to hit them [the communists]
                    hard.” I have to imagine that Haig, being basically a “political” general, went
                    back and told the White House that we should not fail to continue the bombing. I
                    think that the political overhead in any White House has to be careful not to
                    appear to refuse the military their requests, especially if the venture might
                    end disastrously.</p>
                <p>I was in Phnom Penh during that trip and spent three days talking to people in
                    the Embassy, including the Air Attach� , who said, “These guys [the air crews]
                    drop sensors. If anything moves out there at night, they put in an “Arc Light”
                    [carpet bombing] strike. So the Cambodian Army is afraid to move at night. If a
                    herd of cattle moves out there, first thing you know, they're obliterated.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Arc Light” was the code name for B-52 “carpet bombing”
                        strikes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. This campaign became terribly counterproductive, and now and
                    then we made serious “mistakes”. The B-52's at various times blew up an
                    airfield, a hospital, and the ferry crossing [of the Mekong River] at Nhiek
                    Luong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 4, Side A, of an interview with Andrew F.
                        Antippas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Anyway, I imagine that Al Haig went back and told the White House and
                    pretty well told the Washington “establishment” that we cannot stop the bombing
                    of Cambodia. If we lost the war, the same military guys calling for these
                    extreme measures were going to say, “The President of the United States did not
                    do everything at his disposal to win the war.”</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I think that the “carpet bombing” was a terrible mistake. I watched us lose our
                    Congressional support for this enormous amount of bombing that was going on and
                    the killing that was taking place. Sydney Schanberg won a Pulitzer prize for his
                    reporting on the bombing of Cambodia. He was one of those who delighted in
                    reporting on all of the missteps that we were making. Yet we had plenty of
                    tactical aircraft, like the F-111's, that could have been used as flying
                    artillery and air support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a problem that goes on [when you use air power].
                        All you have to do is to think back to Wurzburg and Dresden and World War
                        II. When the generals have these weapons—particularly the Air Force—they
                        don't see what happens. They get too concerned about the tonnage of bombs
                        they can drop. They don't really think about what is happening on the
                        ground.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It's a very mechanical thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a view that “more is better,” and all of that. It
                        often doesn't work that way and can be counterproductive. There are two more
                        things that I would like to talk about during the time that you were in
                        Cambodia. First, you mentioned something about a Foreign Service inspection
                        while you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We had an abbreviated Foreign Service inspection in late 1970. It
                    really wasn't one of the usual inspections. The inspectors happened to be in the
                    area and were asked to visit Phnom Penh, more generally to help to “sort out”
                    the Embassy. Obviously, we desperately needed help, because we had such a
                    limited staff. Suddenly, the Embassy was expanded from eight to 200 Americans,
                    organized very much “on the hoof” [in an unplanned way]. So the inspectors came
                    in to see what they could do to provide us with some guidance on how to put
                    everything together.</p>
                <p>I remember that one Inspector was Allen Morland, who, you will recall, was head
                    of the Visa Office. I think that he finished up his career as Consul General in
                    Toronto. He was a senior inspector on this team. I took him aside and talked to
                    him about my concern about my own future. I said, “Look, this is what happened
                    to me in Vietnam, where I was 'low-ranked.' I wasn't sure whether I was going to
                    be “shot out of the saddle” [selected out]. I said that I didn't know why this
                    had happened, but I was really concerned about my future. I said that here I was
                    in Phnom Penh, helping to fight the good fight in Cambodia. Anyway, he took note
                    of some of this, went back to Washington, and reported it. He was very positive.
                    I think he helped. This is one of the things that really struck me about those
                    inspectors, as had struck me when Randolph Kidder came with the inspectors to
                    Cameroon in 1964. Their attitude was to help people to fix things, instead of
                    functioning as they do now. I found their attitude an ideal use of the
                    inspection function.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other point concerned your time in Cambodia. You have
                        been talking about how inept the Cambodian Army was. Here you had a very
                        proficient and very professional North Vietnamese Army. Why didn't they just
                        take over the country? When you left Cambodia, what did you think about the
                        future prospects at that time? Could you address both of these points?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that we all wondered about that. When you think about it, the
                    Cambodian Army only controlled most of the population centers, most of the
                    provincial capitals. They controlled very little of the countryside. The North
                    Vietnamese pretty much had the run of things. In retrospect, I think that the
                    North Vietnamese could have “cleaned their clock” [i. e., wiped out the
                    Cambodian Army] at any time. I think that they could have taken over the country
                    as early as May, 1970, had it not been for the U. S. “incursion” into Cambodia.
                    I think that they saw their basic role as keeping the Cambodians tied up in
                    knots while they trained the Khmer Rouges to take over. They basically sought to
                    keep the Americans and South Vietnamese occupied and spread out. They knew that
                    the Americans were withdrawing. If they didn't know that from battlefield
                    activity, they certainly knew what was going on at the Paris peace talks. So I
                    think that the Vietnamese didn't overthrow the Cambodian Government, not because
                    they couldn't, but because they decided not to do that. It's as simple as that.
                    There's no other explanation why this rag-tag outfit that the Cambodian
                    Government had become was not wiped out very quickly.I certainly expected that
                    to happen during the first month I was there [April-May, 1970].</p>
                <p>What did I think was going to eventually happen in Cambodia? I was very
                    pessimistic about what was going to happen when I left Cambodia [in 1972]. I was
                    terribly impressed by these two Khmer Rouges cadres whom I debriefed in detail.
                    Even allowing for exaggeration, the fact that the communists had large numbers
                    of these people available to them to set up whatever they were going to set up,
                    while they watched our own presence diminish day by day in Vietnam made it very
                    evident to me that the Vietnam War was not going to be decided in Cambodia.
                    Obviously, Cambodia was part of the problem, but we weren't going to be able to
                    solve the problem in Cambodia. I felt that we really weren't helping ourselves
                    on the political level by letting Lon Nol do everything that he wanted to do—by
                    allowing the corruption to take place, which simply was sapping the will of the
                    Cambodian people. Obviously, the Cambodian people wanted to fight. No Cambodian
                    that I knew wanted to be communized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No Cambodian or Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Or the Vietnamese. For their part, the Cambodians despised the
                    Vietnamese of whatever political persuasion. They just wanted to be left alone.
                    Cambodia was a very viable little country which could function very well on its
                    own. There was no population pressure and no starvation. It was very attractive
                    in its own sense. I really had a tremendous sense of foreboding and of doom.</p>
                <p>I might note some of my interests in Cambodia. Early during my tour in Cambodia I
                    traveled up in the northern part of the country, around Kampong Thom, Siem Reap,
                    and Kampong Cham, which are North, Northeast, and Northwest [of Phnom Penh].
                    This area became my “beat.” I used to go up there by helicopter and talk with
                    provincial governors and take a look around and see what was going on. I did
                    this regularly enough that I did some reporting on these trips.</p>
                <p>I could appreciate what was happening. I became very familiar with the region. We
                    noted that after the Khmer Rouge took over, after I left Phnom Penh but while I
                    was on the Cambodian desk in the Department, the people in the Political Section
                    in Phnom Penh were my friends. One guy, David Carpenter, had been in the
                    Political-Military Section in Vietnam and then Cambodia when we were there. Bill
                    Harben was the Political Section chief and was a “great old pro” in the Foreign
                    Service. We were all on the same wave length. We were privately corresponding
                    with each other all the time. I knew a lot that was going on which wasn't coming
                    in through the official cables. They were simply writing me letters, telling me
                    what was going on and sending me lots of information.</p>
                <p>Early in 1973 Khmer Rouge “main force” units started to concentrate around Phnom
                    Penh, encircling the capital. A lot of heavy fighting was going on outside of
                    Phnom Penh. Many of the provincial capitals were left unguarded by the Khmer
                    Rouge “main force” units. In Kampong Thom, which is half way from Phnom Penh to
                    Siem Reap, the town was surrounded. You could shoot across the perimeter—that's
                    how small it was.</p>
                <p>Then, when he discovered that there were no Khmer Rouge “main force” units around
                    some of the provincial capitals, the Governor of Kampong Thom went out and
                    contacted a lot of the villages in the area. When the people realized that there
                    were no Khmer Rouges to inhibit them, they all headed into Kampong Thom itself.
                    David Carpenter sent photographs taken from helicopters of masses of people
                    streaming into the government controlled towns. The Cambodians knew that there
                    was nobody to protect them. Not only were Cambodian Army forces unable to feed
                    them but they were unable to protect them. But, when they could get away form
                    their villages, the people did so. That was a major indication to us that the
                    Cambodian people didn't like what was happening to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>The second thing was that I got to know the senior monk of the major Buddhist
                    order in Cambodia, the “Mohanikay” order. The senior monk became one of my
                    contacts, and I used to visit him just to talk to him, just to be able to report
                    on what he was thinking. He came from the town of Oudong, which is 35 miles
                    Northwest of Phnom Penh. It had been the capital of Cambodia between the time of
                    Angkor Wat and the advent of the French protectorate in 1850 in Phnom Penh. It
                    was just a little town of a few thousand people, but it was basically known for
                    several special pagodas there. It had a giant Buddha—the only Buddha that faces
                    North, instead of East. It faced North more as a gesture to China than anything
                    else.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the senior monk came from that town and therefore was interesting. Well,
                    the Khmer Rouges took that town in the spring of 1974. I still have a picture
                    taken from an SR-71, a very high altitude reconnaissance aircraft that overflew
                    Cambodia. Every household in the town was burning. I guess that it was taken on
                    infrared film. Of course, the people of the town had run into the forest. It's
                    one of the few towns that the Cambodian Army took back. Basically, they took it
                    back because it was so important from a religious point of view. They found a
                    thousand skeletons in the wreckage of the town, which was a very clear
                    indication to us that it was Khmer Rouges that took the town—not Vietnamese
                    communists. The Vietnamese didn't do that. They didn't kill lots of people.
                    There were other instances, but those are two that I recall vividly about what
                    was going to happen to Cambodia if the Khmer Rouges won.</p>
                <p>So when I left Cambodia, I was very depressed. We didn't have the same kind of
                    people fighting for us that the other side had fighting for them. I knew in 1973
                    that the bombing would have to stop, and we were going to lose what little
                    support we could give them. And that was our own fault. I never felt that we
                    were going to win the war in Cambodia. If we were going to win it at all, it
                    would have to be that we settled something in Vietnam, and part of the payoff
                    would be that we would do something for Cambodia—set up some kind of coalition
                    government there. But in that way we might avoid the bloodbath which we all
                    thought was going to take place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: From July, 1972 to April, 1975—almost three years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had the full experience, then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The whole nine yards, as they say. I was able to be the person who was
                    “in on the takeoff and in on the crash”—for the whole Cambodian adventure. It
                    didn't begin in 1968 but in 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the “Cambodian desk,” what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The whole Indochina apparatus in the State Department has gone through
                    a variety of permutations over the years. During the buildup for the war years
                    in Vietnam, there was a separate “desk” for Vietnam, called “The Vietnam Working
                    Group,” as you might recall. Laos and Cambodia were shunted off to a separate
                    office, run by a Country Director, with desk officers under him. In the case of
                    Laos there was only one desk officer during the almost three years I was there.
                    For Cambodia there were two desk officers: one who followed political affairs,
                    myself, and one who followed economic affairs, including the aid program and all
                    of that. There was plenty of work to do in both areas. Mike Rives was appointed
                    Country Director, replacing Tom Corcoran.</p>
                <p>Of course, as I described previously, I had worked with Mike, starting in 1969
                    when he reopened the Embassy in Phnom Penh. In 1970 I went to Phnom Penh on a
                    TDY [temporary duty] basis to help him when he was Charg� d'Affaires there. The
                    other officer in Phnom Penh with me was Bob Blackburn. He had had no political
                    experience but was a very competent officer. He was a quick study and understood
                    how things worked. The “chemistry” in the relationship between Mike Rives and Al
                    Haig didn't work. I've already mentioned Mike's problems with the Secret Service
                    during Vice President Spiro Agnew's visit to Phnom Penh. Not many people can
                    survive the kind of “slicing job” to which Rives was subjected.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Rives was ultimately appointed Country Director for Laos and Cambodia. I believe
                    that the Personnel guy who arranged this assignment for Mike Rives was Tom
                    Recknagel. Tom is an old friend of mine from way back, from the earliest days of
                    my career. We had studied French in an early morning class at the FSI. Then he
                    was my boss in the Embassy in Saigon, where he was chief of the Political
                    Section, 1967-68]. I was told that, in spite of the objections that the NSC
                    [National Security Council] staff raised against Mike's being assigned as
                    Country Director for Laos and Cambodia, the Department's Personnel section
                    decided that it wasn't going to be dictated to by people outside the building.
                    By that time Mike had also been promoted to FSO-1. 1972 was a critical year on
                    the Cambodian desk in Washington. My work on the desk was largely staying
                    informed, writing memos and staying in touch with the Embassy in Phnom Penh. The
                    two major events in 1972, were the “Watergate Affair” which occurred during the
                    election campaign, though its ramifications dominated events in Washington in
                    1973 and 1974. The other major event in Cambodia was the impact of the Easter
                    offensive in Vietnam. At this time the Vietnamese communist troops were pulled
                    out of Cambodia and sent into combat in Vietnam. The Khmer Rouges took over the
                    conduct of the war in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Easter offensive of 1972. For the record, who was
                        conducting the offensive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: This was the Vietnamese communist “main force” attack on South Vietnam.
                    Eventually, it was turned back mainly through the use of American air power and
                    Saigon Government troops. Many of the U. S. forces had already left South
                    Vietnam by this time. It was the major push by the North Vietnamese and Viet
                    Cong in 1972. The main effect on the Cambodians is that they really got a bloody
                    nose. As the Vietnamese communists pulled out of Cambodia, they just walloped
                    the Cambodian Army. After that we began to find Cambodian communist bodies on
                    the battlefield, instead of Vietnamese communists. It became apparent by that
                    time, even to the most casual observer, that the Khmer Rouges had been committed
                    to combat in Cambodia. There was a “brand new war,” in effect, in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Those people who say that the “secret bombing” of 1969-1970 precipitated the
                    Khmer Rouge struggle against the Cambodian government are simply mistaken. We
                    were fighting Vietnamese communist forces until 1972.</p>
                <p>The second thing that took place on the political level in Cambodia, which I, of
                    course, monitored very closely, was the Cambodian Presidential Elections. The
                    Cambodian government had declared the establishment of a Republic in October,
                    1970. Sihanouk, of course, had been effectively removed from power. There was an
                    acting Chief of State. The government drafted a new constitution, and Lon Nol
                    decided to run for the presidency, even though he was, in effect, crippled by
                    the stroke that he had suffered in December, 1970.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>We had hoped against hope that Lon Nol would drop out of the government and would
                    be replaced by a more reform minded group in the spring of 1971. That didn't
                    happen, basically because of the “machinations” of Lon Non [Lon Nol's younger
                    brother]. Lon Nol ran for president in the spring or summer of 1972—I don't
                    remember exactly when it was. The main candidate against Lon Nol was my old
                    friend, In Tam, who had been Vice President of the National Assembly and
                    Governor of Kampong Cham Province. In my view he was probably the most competent
                    guy in the country. However, the Nixon administration wasn't about to do
                    anything to interfere in what they saw as the “people's choice.” This was a big
                    mistake, in that it meant that we would never really get a handle on military
                    corruption. As a consequence, as we saw over the next several years, Cambodian
                    corruption was enough to “turn off” any support for Cambodia that we had in the
                    U. S., even though the Cambodians were doing the fighting. They had mixed
                    results, obviously, as they weren't doing all of that well. But they were
                    fighting. I don't think that anybody could disagree with that. There is no
                    question about the fact that, when Cambodian refugees would come out of these
                    areas [of combat] when they could, the people were “voting with their feet.”
                    There was absolutely no question of this. Nobody wanted to live under communist
                    control. The Cambodians were fighting, and all they wanted from us was our
                    material support.</p>
                <p>I think we were unable to continue that material support because of the scandals
                    that went on. If you change the place names and the names of the people, it
                    could have been the situation in nationalist China before the communist
                    takeover. It was the same kind of thing. There were military units with
                    “phantom” payrolls. They'd send a brigade out on an operation, but, in fact, it
                    was only a battalion. If you were sensible, you never went out with the
                    Cambodian Army on anything much less than a multi-brigade operation, to make
                    sure that there were enough people to protect you. The Cambodian Army would sell
                    POL [petroleum and other lubricants] and ammunition to the communists—anything
                    was fair game to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it look when you were on the Cambodian desk in
                        Washington? Were you getting reports that business was pretty much as usual
                        in Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. By that time the Nixon administration and the American Embassy
                    were becoming increasingly unwilling to communicate any “bad news.” They were
                    really afflicted with “clientitis.” I was getting letters from my friends in the
                    Political Section in Phnom Penh which contrasted with the official cables being
                    sent to the Department, as I mentioned before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of letters were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: My friends in the Embassy would write letters to me and tell me their
                    views on what was happening. When people would come back to Washington on leave,
                    they would come in and visit and tell me. So I think that I had a pretty good
                    insight into what was happening, over and above the official telegrams from the
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the historian, what happens to those “private”

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: One of my responsibilities was to make sure that I didn't expose these
                    guys who wrote to me. They were getting into enough trouble as it was, “bucking
                    the system” inside the Embassy. The “system” involved Ambassador Coby Swank
                    being told what to do by the [U. S.] military. I think I've mentioned this
                    before. Coby probably wasn't the right choice to be the Ambassador there. He was
                    a decent individual and as competent an officer as there is. We really needed a
                    person as strong minded as Tom Enders, except that Tom Enders was going to do
                    what Henry Kissinger wanted, because he had been one of Kissinger's students [at
                    Harvard] and had his own agenda as well. It was very clear that the Nixon
                    administration really didn't want to “rock the boat.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you'd be sitting in meetings in the Department and
                        people would be talking about where Cambodia was going. By that time a

                        Department of State—had served at one time or another in one of the three
                        Indochina countries. You weren't talking to a bunch of “starry-eyed”
                        people.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was their attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Actually, it was very negative. I worked under several Assistant
                    Secretaries of State. Marshall Green went off to be Ambassador to Australia
                    after that. He was replaced by G. McMurtrie Godley, who had been in the Congo
                    and then in Laos during the “secret war.” He was a wonderful guy. I had known
                    him slightly in Africa. I was in the Central African Republic when he was in the
                    [former Belgian] Congo, during the crisis over the seizure of some of our people
                    in Stanleyville. I had visited him in Vientiane in 1969, when we were in Saigon.
                    He became Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>Then he was replaced by Phil Habib in 1974. Phil, of course, as I think I
                    mentioned before when I described how the Political Section in Saigon operated,
                    was one of those people who liked controversy and liked to be challenged. He
                    liked to challenge his officers and was really quite a breath of fresh air in
                    the system. As I look back on it now, I really felt quite intimidated by the
                    negativism of almost all of the country desk officers in the Bureau of East
                    Asian Affairs. At our staff meetings we would have a roomful of country desk
                    officers...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “negative,” what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, they were almost all against our policy in Indochina. They wanted
                    to “cut our losses” and get the hell out of Indochina. That was basically it.
                    They were dealing with their “clients” [in East Asia] and they could see the
                    impact that our Indochina policy was having on our policies toward those [other]
                    countries, everywhere from Australia to Japan. This really came across very
                    clearly. Should I then get up and make a speech to my colleagues about how we
                    should help “our little brown brothers” in Cambodia? I would be laughed out of
                    the room. Everyone knew where I stood, anyhow.</p>
                <p>The biggest chore that I had in 1973-1975 was the credentials fight for Lon Nol's
                    government at the UN. This involved our effort to save the seat of the Khmer
                    Republic from the challenge of Sihanouk and his communist associates in the
                    so-called “GRUNK” [Gouvernement Royal Unifie Khmer], the Royal Unified Khmer
                    Government. The political arm of this government was called the “FUNK” [Front
                    Unifie Khmer], the Khmer United Front. So it [Sihanouk's faction] was sometimes
                    referred to as the “GRUNK/FUNK.” They were our opponents. My job for several
                    years was to beat the drum and make sure that every one of our Embassies abroad
                    went to their host government foreign ministries and urged them to vote for “our
                    side.” This didn't make me very popular in the Department of State at all. Not
                    only was I not popular in the Bureau of East Asian Affairs but in the whole
                    building. I would go around and beat the drum all over the building—”roller
                    skating” up and down the corridors and visiting every desk. I was “thrown out”
                    of the best desks in the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to these meetings with Habib and the desk
                        officers. The other people were “negative” as all get out. How did you feel
                        about it? You had a “client.” This was your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I had a very personal feeling about it. I knew these Cambodians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your personal feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: My personal feeling was a certain loyalty to the Cambodians. I knew
                    them, “warts and all,” because I had followed this problem from the vantage
                    point of Vietnam in the late 1960's. A number of our so-called “allies” in
                    Cambodia had been, in effect, on the communist payroll before the Cambodian Army
                    overthrew Sihanouk. However, as I saw it, the point was that the Cambodian
                    people didn't want to be communists. They were fighting. They didn't ask for
                    direct American combat assistance. You could argue that the very fact that we
                    had a policy which got us involved in Vietnam dragged the Cambodians into the
                    struggle as well. So I felt that we had a certain responsibility for what was
                    going on there. Obviously, you couldn't carry that too far. In the first
                    instance it was very much in our interest to keep them fighting as long as
                    possible, because that helped us in the negotiating stance [on Vietnam in
                    Paris]. Secondly, it helped us to get our troops out of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>To me that was the critical consideration. I'll never forget the fact that the
                    last American killed in Vietnam, an American Army colonel, was hit by a rocket
                    fired from Cambodia by the Vietnamese, during the Easter offensive of 1972. He
                    was the last actual combat casualty.</p>
                <p>I knew some of these Cambodians and I played a certain role in getting some of
                    them to work for us. In 1974, I think, I played a key role in convincing the
                    then [Cambodian] Foreign Minister to take the job of Prime Minister. I wrote the
                    paper that was used by Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth Rush in his meeting
                    with this individual, asking him to take on the job. He was a good man, very
                    active, very intelligent. In fact, he was killed by the Khmer Rouges at the very
                    end because he did not manage to escape from Phnom Penh.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I remember meeting him at the Diplomatic entrance of the Department in
                    Washington. He had been in New York and came down from the UN. It may have been
                    March, 1974, or about that time—I would have to look up my notes to see. He came
                    down to Washington for a meeting with Deputy Secretary Rush. I had written the
                    briefing memorandum for the Deputy Secretary, giving him the arguments why this
                    guy should take the position of Prime Minister. The Minister was well regarded
                    by the Embassy in Phnom Penh. He had served as Minister of Information as well
                    as Ambassador to the Asian Development Bank in Manila. He knew I had supported
                    his appointment as Prime Minister. He said, “I'll take the job of Prime Minister
                    if you will stay on the desk and protect our interests.” He knew very well how
                    Um Sim and I had operated and the role I had played in getting Um Sim appointed.
                    I told him that I would stay the extra year. My initial assignment on the desk
                    had been for two years. In point of fact, in personal terms, I probably should
                    have moved on at that time, instead of being there for the “crash” [of our
                    Cambodian policy].</p>
                <p>I knew these people personally and felt a certain responsibility toward them and
                    knew—better than most people—the actual conditions on the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the general feeling, say, within the “Indochina
                        complex” in Washington about Cambodia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: For many in the liberal camp “Cambodia was a dirty word. It was felt in
                    many quarters that it was, to use William Shawcross's terms, “a sideshow”. That
                    was a very apt name for it. Nobody really knew that much about it. I think that
                    most people saw Cambodia as one of those things to be used. It was the sort of
                    thing that you had to do to try to protect our flanks in Vietnam. If we could
                    get a decent, negotiated settlement in Vietnam, maybe that would be all right
                    for the Cambodians as well. I don't think that anybody really lost much sleep
                    about Cambodia in the Washington community, quite frankly. Generally, they
                    didn't think that the Cambodians were very great fighters and that we were using
                    up a lot of our credibility by supporting them. Cambodia was a pretty poor
                    “client” to be representing.</p>
                <p>I may have told you that when Secretary of State Rogers left the Department in
                    1973, to be replaced by Henry Kissinger, the custom was to allocate a time when
                    anyone who wanted to see him could do so, shake his hand, and say goodbye.
                    Practically the whole building walked up and shook his hand. As I passed
                    through, since I had briefed him a couple of times, he did sort of recognized my
                    face. I introduced myself and said, “Sir, I'm the first mate on the 'Titanic.'”
                    He laughed at that. He knew exactly what I was talking about. That's kind of the
                    way I felt. We were really on a collision course, and our policy probably wasn't
                    going to be successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>But I felt so proud of the Cambodians. They were so central to our policy. The
                    whole debate over the War Powers Act turned on the unauthorized bombing of
                    Cambodia in 1972-1973. This debate was going on about the time I made that trip
                    with Al Haig. I'll never forget the feeling that we all had in the Summer of
                    1973 when U. S. Air Force participation in Cambodia was “turned off.” They made
                    the last strafing runs across the skies of Cambodia. We all held our breath and
                    felt that our “clients” were going to go down the drain, because now they had no
                    protection. A major offensive took place in the provincial capital of Kampong
                    Cham, on the Mekong River. There was one hell of a fight up there. Amazingly
                    enough, the Cambodians stood their ground and beat off the Vietnamese offensive.
                    The Khmer Rouges were in contact with the Cambodian Army, but Kampong Cham was
                    so close to the Vietnamese controlled, rubber plantation “sanctuaries” that the
                    Vietnamese communists were very much involved in that fight. But the Cambodians
                    survived. I was surprised but so proud of them. I used to say to people, “How
                    can we abandon these people when they're fighting like hell?”</p>
                <p>I became too emotionally involved. I still am, to this day. I still feel very
                    “uptight” about it, when I think about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Sihanouk? At the time you were on the
                        Cambodian desk, Sihanouk was out of power. He was wandering around the world
                        and was in Beijing quite a bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: And in Pyongyang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you following what he did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. Of course, he became the “hand maiden” of the Khmer Rouges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Oh, yes, very much so. He made a very well publicized trip to the
                    “liberated zone” [i. e., Khmer Rouge controlled zone] of Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wearing one of those little scarves [which the Khmer
                        Rouges wear]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly, and with several of the former “three ghosts.” There was a
                    great debate about three of the former Khmer Rouge leaders during the 1960's.
                    These were not the people who had gone to North Vietnam in 1954, but local Khmer
                    Rouge leaders: Khieu Samphan, Hu Yun, Hu Nim The only survivor was Khieu Samphan
                    who is the putative head of the Khmer Rouges, who is still alive. I obtained a
                    copy of Doctoral thesis from the University of Paris which was critical of
                    French colonial policy and became the theoretical basis of the Khmer Rouges
                    policy of returning Cambodian society to the earth or the “year zero”.Anyway,
                    there was a great debate about whether the three ghosts had been eliminated by
                    Sihanouk in the mid 1960's. What happened was that they simply went into the
                    bush and disappeared. They resurfaced after 1970. But there were many of us who
                    didn't believe that they were alive and that these were impostors who were
                    created simply to develop popular support. They had been popular in the National
                    Assembly. They were National Assembly members—communist and Marxist members of
                    the National Assembly who had really been pains in the neck to Sihanouk and Lon
                    Nol in that time period.</p>
                <p>It turned out that they, in fact, were alive. I spent a lot of time in Cambodia
                    going around and asking people, “Do you recognize this picture?” We would get
                    these pictures from communist sources. We would also tape their radio broadcasts
                    that the FBIS [Foreign Broadcast Information Service] would pick up. I would go
                    around asking people who had known them and ask them, “Are these the voices of
                    these same people?” I even remember asking, “Do you recognize the shape of this
                    guy's ears?” It was kind of detective work. Anyway, it turned out that they were
                    real.</p>
                <p>As I said before, Sihanouk made a very well publicized trip with them in the
                    1973-1974 time frame. It was clear that he was so angry at those people such as
                    Lon Nol who had betrayed him and thrown him out of office that he was determined
                    to bring them down, whatever the cost. He no doubt felt that he would be able to
                    control events after that. I am not sure if that, in fact, is accurate. I think
                    that he was as much a prisoner of the communists as anybody was. In fact, the
                    communists killed off a number of members of his family when they took power. We
                    know that now. Sihanouk was basically held under what amounted to “house arrest”
                    for several years by the Khmer Rouges after they took power. But there's no
                    question that Sihanouk was very valuable to FUNK and GRUNK and to the communist
                    cause generally. I used to say that he was worth four communist divisions to
                    them because he played their game. People in the Non-Aligned Movement thought
                    that he was a great hero and couldn't be wrong.</p>
                <p>But your question was, “What did we think?” I know what I thought and I know what
                    many people in the State Department thought. I'm not sure what the Nixon
                    administration thought—how the NSC viewed him...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any efforts made to contact him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I suspect that there were, but I don't think that he was his own
                    master. Any efforts that we made to talk to the Khmer Rouges were just ignored.
                    They just “would not play ball.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Khmer Rouges during the time that you
                        were on the Cambodian desk. You were on the desk when the Vietnamese pulled
                        out of Cambodia to “do their own thing” in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling at that time about the Khmer
                        Rouges?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, I think there was surprise in the intelligence community at the
                    fact that they were able to field a major force. I don't think that anybody had
                    really appreciated the fact that the Vietnamese had these Cambodian cadres in
                    North Vietnam during all of those years—15 years or whatever it was. Then the
                    Vietnamese sent them back to Cambodia and corralled themselves a peasant army.
                    Obviously, these troops were “dragooned” or conscripted into the Khmer Rouge
                    army. They gave a fairly good account of themselves, from the very beginning,
                    except in the face of our air power.</p>
                <p>I told you of the sinking feeling that I had after I interviewed several of those
                    Khmer Rouge “returnees.” They were middle level cadres. I was shocked to find
                    out the quality of the training which they had received. I said to myself,
                    “We're really in trouble, because we don't have anything like that and we won't
                    get them under the combat situation we were in.”</p>
                <p>The only thing that we had anywhere near that was the “Mike Force” people, the
                    Khmer Krom from South Vietnam. They were basically Cambodians, but they were
                    from South Vietnam, so their attitude was slightly different. Of course, the
                    casualties which they incurred were very heavy during the first couple of years.
                    Khmer Rouge casualties were also very heavy. I am sure that the great majority
                    of the 5,000 cadres who returned to Cambodia from North Vietnam were killed
                    off.</p>

                <p>ANTIPPAS: Oh, yes. We saw many pictures of those troops. They were young people.
                    Their commanders were well trained and were definitely in charge. There is no
                    question about it. They very definitely had their agenda.</p>

                        Penh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes, we're talking about 1973-1974. On a number of occasions the Khmer
                    Rouges would take forces away from areas that they had captured. They massed
                    their forces for an offensive against Phnom Penh, for example. There were
                    several offensives against Phnom Penh which were beaten back. To do that, they
                    would take troops away from certain areas. When these troops would get down
                    below a certain level, the local people would “take off” and would go to a
                    provincial capital still held by the “friendlies,” even though the “friendlies”
                    couldn't protect them. It was very clear how those people felt, in the stories
                    they were telling about what was happening out there.</p>
                <p>I think that we had a very clear view, long before the fall of Cambodia, of what
                    was going to happen, in general. However, I don't think that anybody predicted
                    the ferocity [which they displayed]. You knew that Cambodian Army officers would
                    suffer, maybe the bureaucrats, and maybe the teachers. Perhaps they would all
                    get “zinged,” because that's what the communists do. However, the Khmer Rouges
                    took it out on anybody who could read. They killed anybody that wore eyeglasses.
                    People like these were taken out and killed, because anybody that could read was
                    obviously a “threat” to them.</p>

                        the other communist troops did this—the Vietnamese...</hi>

                <p>ANTIPPAS: Absolutely. We were shocked.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this, at the time or afterwards, did you have
                        any feeling about why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that we kind of “kidded” ourselves into thinking that these
                    were very nice little brown people who were very “laid back,” as you pointed
                    out. In fact, the Cambodians had a reputation of being very tough people. They
                    were used by the French as police in Indochina. The French Empire, the French
                    colonial administration, used Vietnamese as bureaucrats in all three states of
                    Indochina [Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia]. They used Cambodians as the police,
                    because the Cambodians did what they were told and they were “tough.”</p>
                <p>I had this theory that I used to put forward of the three “races”—the Lao, the
                    Vietnamese, and the Cambodians. The Cambodians were the best fed of the three.
                    Their diet was the best. They ate more meat than any of the others, since they
                    belonged to a cattle-owning society. They had a lot of cattle. Not that this
                    made them necessarily bloodthirsty, but I think that there is some relationship
                    between people who slaughter cattle and who can be “tough.” In fact, the means
                    of execution used by the Khmer Rouges resembled how you slaughter
                    cattle—”pole-axing,” cutting throats, and things like that. So I had this theory
                    that the Cambodians weren't as “blas�" as we used to think and their pre war
                    tourist based propaganda had us believe. In fact, they had a very “tough”
                    background. Cambodian troops had fought in World War I in the French Army and
                    gave a fairly good accounting of themselves. This is not well known, but they
                    did. They did what they were told, they were well disciplined when they were
                    trained, and they had this dietary preference.</p>
                <p>One of the things that really upset me in 1979, when I was put on a task force
                    for famine relief in Cambodia, was to think that there could be any famine in a
                    place like Cambodia, given its well known attributes in terms of fish, rice, and
                    cattle. You really have to work hard to starve a country like Cambodia—the size
                    of Indiana or Missouri. It's not that big a country. The fact that people were
                    starving to death meant that, obviously, somebody was working hard to achieve
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Pol Pot? Did we have any feel about him? Was he

                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I forget what his real name is. He was a student in Paris. One of my
                    jobs was to try and keep track of all of these people and learn about them. One
                    of the things I accomplished was that I was one of the first people to get a
                    copy of the doctoral thesis of one of these three “ghosts,” the man who is now
                    the key Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan.He was one of a number of Cambodians
                    who went to Paris in the 1940's and 1950's and became communists. The fact is
                    that the French Left probably created more home grown communists in their former
                    colonial areas than any place else. We have a lot of data on the names of
                    Cambodian students in France who became communists or were co-opted by the
                    French Left. Pol Pot was one of these students. I'm told that he was an
                    electronics student, who failed his technical studies. He returned to Cambodia
                    an embittered man. Having been co-opted by the communists, he went to work for
                    the local resistance to the French colonial system.</p>
                <p>Not everyone admired Sihanouk as an administrator. Sihanouk really acted like
                    royalty. People tell stories about Sihanouk the first time he came to the United
                    States, which I think was in 1959, under the Eisenhower administration. He
                    landed on the West Coast. He was received there by the Under Secretary of State.
                    Christian Herter was the Secretary of State at the time. I forgot who the Under
                    Secretary was it may have been Douglas Dillon. I remember reading a report of
                    this first meeting with Sihanouk and how absolutely amazed this Under Secretary
                    was at the way Sihanouk's entourage treated him. No one in his entourage would
                    walk up to him. They would literally “crawl” up to him, on all fours, not daring
                    even to look at him. It was kind of the way Japanese Emperor Hirohito was
                    treated before World War II. People were not even allowed to look at him.
                    Sihanouk had been king for 30 years when he was thrown out. He'd been around a
                    long time. You kind of get used to it. When you become king at the age of 17,
                    you learn a certain way of behaving. So I think that the Cambodian communists
                    really didn't like him because he treated them as royalty did in the middle
                    ages. They had their axes to grind, too. They viewed him as a hand maiden of the
                    French and the colonial powers. Of course, the communists wanted to change all
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the whole thing “play out?” Can you talk about the
                        “end game,” from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, the major problem was continuing the supply of rice and
                    ammunition to the Cambodians. We had “saved” the seat of the Cambodian
                    Government at the UN, so they still had some political power. Our aid program
                    had been cut back dramatically. Those people in Congress who were against the
                    whole effort in Vietnam and Cambodia took steps to cut off even the small amount
                    of military assistance that we were giving them. Toward the end [in 1975]
                    supplies had to be flown in, because the Mekong River was no longer safe for
                    navigation. Most of the heavy stuff had been brought up the Mekong River from
                    Vietnam, but the supply line was interdicted in a number of places.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I think that in the late winter of 1974 or early spring of 1975, the Vietnamese
                    or the Cambodians figured that aid was going to be cut off. I recall that
                    Ambassador John Gunther Dean testified before Congress after the end in
                    Cambodia—and I accompanied him up to the Hill to talk to the East Asian
                    subcommittee chaired then by Congressman Lee Hamilton. Hamilton asked Dean if he
                    thought Congress was at fault for the loss of Cambodia. Dean was very cagey and
                    dodged that bullet but answered by saying that, “Nobody fights to the last
                    cartridge.”</p>
                <p>I think that the Cambodians just gave up hope.</p>
                <p>I can't speak directly to Vietnam, since I wasn't really dealing with the issue.
                    In Cambodia the “siege areas” tightened. The Khmer Rouges were closing in on
                    several provincial capitals, which the “friendlies” still held. I think that
                    when they got the message that there would be no more assistance and we started
                    pulling our advisers and observers out of local areas, the Cambodians understood
                    that they were being left on their own.</p>
                <p>During the third week of April when the Embassy in Phnom Penh was actually
                    evacuated, we thought that we might have to shoot our way out. I say, “We.”
                    Actually, I was observing all of this from the vantage point of Washington. The
                    feeling was that the Cambodian Government forces might, in fact, impede the
                    evacuation of the Embassy. There was some apprehension about what would happen.
                    However, the Cambodians were almost lackadaisical about it. Our people just
                    left. In fact, the Cambodian military guarded the Embassy building until the
                    very end—not allowing anybody in. The interesting phenomenon was in the days
                    between our pullout and the Khmer Rouge takeover, almost the whole cabinet had
                    refused evacuation, I was told there was a euphoria among cabinet members in
                    that they felt that finally they were their own masters. All those leaders who
                    remained behind were executed immediately. Sisowath Sirik Matak, the former
                    Deputy Prime Minister, who refused evacuation and expressed his contempt for
                    America's abandonment in a letter to John Gunther Dean, was hauled out of his
                    refuge at the French Embassy in a garbage truck and killed. Lon Non, who had
                    returned to Cambodia in spite of my efforts to keep him here went out to meet
                    and negotiate with the incoming Khmer Rouges and he was immediately shot by
                    firing squad on the banks of the Mekong River. My friend In Tam was in the
                    Western Provinces and he made it to the Thai border with his whole family in a
                    hail of gunfire. The Thai put him under house arrest and I was unable to see him
                    when I visited Thailand as part of the Refugee Task Force in the Summer of
                    1975.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: He was tough. He was viewed as a very hard liner. He made very strong
                    pitches for assistance and continued support for Cambodia. He was very angry,
                    for example, when I “let” Lon Non leave the U. S. to go back to Cambodia. John
                    was a very strong figure in Phnom Penh. But the Ford Administration literally
                    had no cards to play with. Congress had turned off the water. There was a lot of
                    bitterness about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you dealing with Congress at all at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Oh, yes. Not directly, of course, since we weren't supposed to be
                    “lobbying.” However, we obviously had contact with a variety of people in
                    various Congressional committees. I had a lot of direct contact with Dick Moose
                    and Jim Lowenstein and later Chuck Meissner, who were “investigators” [for the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee]. So there was a dialogue of sorts. However,
                    it was very clear that there were elements in Congress that wanted to stop the
                    war, pure and simple. They were tired of having people “kill each other with
                    American weapons.” This was kind of a favorite quote at the time. They worked
                    continuously to stop the assistance [to Cambodia and Vietnam]. This was what
                    happened. It happened for Vietnam and it happened for Cambodia. Nothing that
                    anybody could say about the explicit and implicit commitments of the United
                    States for the previous 20 years, would change their view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your colleagues within the Department. What was

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Everybody pretty well saw the handwriting on the wall. The attitude of
                    most of my colleagues—the desk officers for the various countries in the Bureau
                    of East Asian Affairs, including even those who had served in Vietnam—was “a pox
                    on all of their houses. Let's just get out of there and end it.” The raiding of
                    what little money was available for military assistance to Indochina, where it
                    was obviously going to waste, didn't make any friends for us on other desks in
                    the Department. So there was a lot of bitterness about that. I can sympathize
                    with how those people felt at the time. It was very much of a “down” feeling for
                    anyone working on Indochina at that time. Everyone was pretty depressed.</p>

                <p>I was only in Consular Affairs for a couple of weeks when the Bureau of East
                    Asian Affairs created the Refugee Task Force. I was actually working on this
                    task force at night when the evacuation of the Embassy took place. After the
                    evacuation took place, the inter-departmental task force was established. It was
                    obviously more than the Bureau of East Asian Affairs could handle. When the
                    evacuation of the Embassy was going on, I was monitoring events up in the
                    Operations Center in the Department. They were telling people that they had to
                    limit the baggage they could take out of Saigon. I remember the Executive
                    Director of the Bureau saying, “Don't let anybody take out any of those bloody
                    ceramic elephants.” Most people left everything behind and just took out a
                    suitcase. Not even pets were allowed to be taken out.</p>
                <p>During the day I'd be working in the Bureau of Consular Affairs. I remember that
                    Admiral Zumwalt called me one day. I don't know if he was still Chief of Naval
                    Operations or had just retired. He called me to say—this was before we actually
                    closed down the Embassy in Saigon—that he very much wanted to bring the former
                    Vietnamese Chief of Naval Operations, with whom he had worked, out of Vietnam.
                    We were still issuing visas to Vietnamese at the time. So on Zumwalt's behalf I
                    called the guy who had your job as Consul General in Saigon—I can't remember his
                    name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I forget, too. The Consul General in Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: He subsequently served in Haiti. He had a heart attack, I think, as a
                    consequence. I remember calling this poor guy in the middle of the night,
                    getting him out of bed, and asking him to take care of Zumwalt's “buddy.” I
                    guess we did take care of him in terms of issuing him a visa but I think he too
                    decided to remain behind to care for his Father.</p>
                <p>It all went down the drain very quickly, I thought. The Consular Section in
                    Saigon stopped issuing visas—stopped letting people into the compound. The end
                    came fast in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you care to talk about the refugee situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Sure. I was one of the original recruits [on the task force].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the Cambodian Desk in April [1975] and went to
                        Consular Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Tom Recknagel [former chief of the Political Section in Saigon and then
                    in Personnel in the Department] recruited me for the job as Special Assistant to
                    the Administrator of Security and Consular Affairs. He was the Senior Deputy
                    Assistant Administrator and about to retire himself. No sooner did I start this
                    job when I was immediately drafted into the East Asia Bureau task force which
                    was set up. I was allowed to work at night so that I could continue to work
                    during the day [in Consular Affairs]. Basically, that task force dealt with the
                    evacuation of both Phnom Penh, Saigon, and other places in Vietnam. After April
                    25, [1975], when Saigon was evacuated, it was decided that we needed to broaden
                    the scope of our efforts because we would have to deal with all of these
                    refugees who were coming out of Indochina. Ambassador Dean Brown, former Under
                    Secretary of State for Management, who was then the Director of the Middle East
                    Institute, was selected to be in charge of the task force. He pulled together a
                    bunch of people—most of the old Indochina hands, including a number of the
                    people who came out of the Consulates and the Embassy in Saigon. I don't think
                    that anybody from the Embassy in Phnom Penh went to work on the task force. A
                    number of these guys who were evacuated were brought back and were either
                    working in the task force in Washington or were sent out to field operations,
                    where we set up reception centers for the refugees, like Guam, Camp Pendleton,
                    Fort Chaffee, Indiantown Gap and places like that. It was a big operation to try
                    to pull this together and decide what the policy would be.</p>
                <p>We had representation from the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service]. The
                    Deputy Commissioner of INS was a member of the task force. The Commissioner of
                    INS was a member but, for operational work, we had his deputy and an assistant
                    commissioner.</p>
                <p>After some time the task force was reorganized, and I was put in charge of a unit
                    which dealt with the Vietnamese that didn't make it to U. S. territory or to U.
                    S. bases, such as the Philippines or American ships or Guam. They escaped to
                    Malaysia, Thailand, and other locations. So I headed up a unit of several
                    officers and a secretary that worked with INS in particular to figure out how we
                    were going to get these people into the U. S. and what criteria we would use to
                    select them. Everybody that made it to U.S. territory, in fact, we took,
                    including a number of “Third Country Nationals” who decided that they weren't
                    going back to the Philippines or Korea. They decided that they were refugees,
                    too, and were going to the United States. They refused to be repatriated to
                    their home countries. I think that we actually took some of these guys, because
                    we couldn't forcibly repatriate them. I never understood that. I really never
                    understood how a Korean “Third Country National,” who had been working in
                    Vietnam, made it to Guam and was permitted to go to the United States as a
                    refugee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess it was just too complicated [to send him back to
                        his own country].</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was kind of interesting. I made a trip out to Southeast Asia to see
                    some of these locations with an Assistant Commissioner of the INS and one of the
                    senior deputies in the task force. His name escapes me now. He finished up his
                    career as an Ambassador to Haiti, as a matter of fact. He was an old Indochina
                    hand. He had run the computer program for...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this McManaway [spelling?]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Yes. Clay McManaway, this Assistant Commissioner of the INS, and I. We
                    went to Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to talk to the local
                    governments, our Embassies and to get a handle on how many people had made it
                    their shores. That is, the original “wave” of boat people not the subsequent
                    ones after 1977. We got to Kuala Lumpur just after the Japanese “Red Army “
                    terror squad captured one of our consular officers in the Embassy. The consular
                    officer, Bob Stebbins, later became my deputy in Seoul, in fact—an old friend of
                    mine. He had been a courier when I was in Africa. He had the dubious distinction
                    of having the “Red Army Faction” take him as a hostage.</p>
                <p>We didn't go to Indonesia. We were trying to find out how big the problem was and
                    what would be the criteria that we would use to decide which of these people we
                    were going to take.</p>
                <p>I worked on this task force for about six months. The Administrator of Consular
                    Affairs in the Department began to squawk about where his special assistant was.
                    So I managed to get away from the task force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a question or so on the criteria you used on the task
                        force. Was the idea to pare the numbers down—to get as many of these people
                        into the U. S. as you possibly could?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The fundamental criterion was that if they could make any linkage at
                    all with the United States, we would take them. If they had relatives in the U.
                    S. or had worked for the Americans in some fashion, we would take them. Of
                    course, the numbers of refugees were not that large at that time. I think that
                    in the first few months after the evacuation [of the Embassy in Saigon] total
                    Vietnamese refugees in particular—Cambodians didn't take to boats in any
                    numbers—were only about 12,000 to 13,000. The numbers were really fairly
                    small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The big problem came later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Subsequently. After I got to Thailand, the “boat people” started coming
                    out in numbers reminiscent of what's happening in Cuba today. We were trying to
                    handle the refugees in a workmanlike fashion.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Let me say a couple of things about working fairly closely with the Commissioner
                    of the INS. At that time the Commissioner was General Leonard Cushman, the
                    former Commandant of the Marine Corps. He turned out to be a very charming
                    individual and all that. I would go over to his office from time to time to
                    negotiate the acceptance of certain individuals that we wanted to take from
                    these offshore camps [in Southeast Asia]. I would go over to his office and
                    would put these names up to him. He would veto them or accept them, as the case
                    happened to be. He used to say that he was the guy who “taught Antippas how to
                    say No.” We had an interesting time. During the first days after the evacuation
                    of our people from Saigon, I accompanied General Chapman to a hearing of the
                    Senate Appropriations Committee chaired by Senator McClellan of Arkansas. I
                    remember McClellan telling us to order all American ships in the Philippines
                    Straits to clear out because they were like a “neon sign saying welcome”.
                    McClellan said he feared a flood of refugees. He was right. The Senator
                    subsequently was further annoyed when we opened one of the reception centers for
                    the refugees at Fort Chaffee. Anyhow, it was quite an interesting learning
                    experience, working directly with General Cushman and his Deputy
                    Commissioner.</p>
                <p>At the time my personal feeling was that we “owed” something to an awful lot of
                    people [in the Indochina countries], but I really couldn't agree that we should
                    take everybody. I continued to feel that way all during the entire exercise.
                    Simply deciding to take everybody that wanted to come out [of the Indochina
                    countries] just didn't make sense from the American interest point of view. It
                    certainly did not pay off any debts we owed people because of the fact that we'd
                    been there.</p>
                <p>I think that mine was a minority view at the time, because I was one of the few
                    consular officers actually involved in the task force most of the time. To most
                    of the old Indochina hands who were running the task force, the idea was, “Let
                    them all in.” They had a kind of personal commitment about that. We'll talk more
                    about that when we discuss my time in Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back to work for the Director of Consular Affairs
                        in the Department. Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That was Len Walentynowicz, a lawyer from Buffalo, NY, a very decent
                    and intelligent guy. However, he really became sort of a Polish joke in the
                    State Department, both in terms of his sartorial splendor and his use of the
                    English language. I think that he thought he was going to be sitting at the
                    right hand of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He was rather surprised to
                    find that he only attended the staff meetings of Larry Eagleburger [then Under
                    Secretary of State for Management]. He was liked well enough but was viewed as
                    quite a “tyro” in foreign affairs. He definitely wanted to “do right” by the
                    consular business, in terms of obtaining manpower and “doing the job.” I grew to
                    like “Wally” a great deal as an individual. Obviously, he had a lot to learn.
                    Lorry Lawrence was the senior deputy in Consular Affairs by that time. He was
                    Wally's “mentor.” Lorry and I used to “car pool” in to the Department from the
                    Bethesda area. We saw a lot of each other and became very good friends during
                    that time.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest problems that the Administrator of Consular Affairs had at
                    that time was Frances Knight, who was head of the Passport Office. She was an
                    institution all by herself. No administrator of Consular Affairs ever really
                    solved that problem—until Frances retired. She wouldn't even come to the SCA/CON
                    [Security and Consular Affairs/Consular] staff meetings. She would always send
                    one of her deputies to the staff meetings. I think that this was really a little
                    “much” to say that you could run a bureau like that and not really be in charge
                    of it.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, I spent about six months there [as special assistant to the director of
                    Consular Affairs].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I went from SCA to be chief of the Consular Section in the Embassy in
                    Bangkok, on the recommendation of Lorry Lawrence, who said that I probably ought
                    to “bail out.” This was before the 1976 elections. Lorry anticipated that the
                    Republicans were going to lose the elections, and he and I would probably be out
                    “on our ears.” Given a Republican administrator in Consular Affairs, it was
                    probably time to move. Lorry Lawrence took the job of Consul General in the
                    Embassy in London. He told me, “The Ambassador has told us that he desperately
                    needs somebody in Bangkok 'to clean up that mess out there.' Why don't you go
                    out and do that?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Bangkok from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: From the fall of 1976 to 1979. An interesting time to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, what was the situation that you
                        found?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was a very grim situation. A Thai civilian government had finally
                    taken over power from the Thai military in 1973. The Prime Minister was Khukrit
                    Pramoj, who was sort of a socialist. Anyway, the Thai government decided that
                    with the end of the Vietnam War there should no longer be an American military
                    presence in Thailand.</p>
                <p>So the thousands of military personnel that we had at these air bases in Thailand
                    were told to get out within a very short period of time.</p>
                <p>It became a major consular task to document the dependents of U. S. military
                    personnel. Between that job and the problems posed by the refugees, this created
                    some difficulty. The refugee problem was not as serious as it later became. In
                    fact, the Consular Section was really short-staffed, given the work that they
                    had. The Consular Section was a “zoo.” It was really in bad shape. The chief of
                    the Consular Section at the time was someone you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Margaret Barnhart, an old colleague. We had worked together in Japan.
                    She was in the Embassy in Tokyo when I was in the Consulate in Kobe. She was in
                    over her head. She was so busy that she literally closed her door.</p>
                <p>She would go into her office, close the door, and sit at her desk. She didn't
                    know what the hell was going on. She told the senior local just to keep his eye
                    on the Americans working in the Consular Section. It later turned out that the
                    senior local was one of the most corrupt people in the Consular Section. Talk
                    about “putting a fox in the hen coop.” The junior officers threatened to
                    initiate a grievance case if Barnhart wasn't pulled out. So I was given the job
                    to replace her and try to shape the place up. I have to say that I think that I
                    did a good job in a rather short time.</p>
                <p>Charley Whitehouse was the Ambassador at that time. The DCM [in the fall of 1976]
                    was John R. Burke. He had been Country Director for the Vietnam Working Group
                    when we were in Saigon. He was later Ambassador to Guyana. We were old friends.
                    There were a lot of old buddies there. I don't think that they ever thought of
                    me as a consular officer. They had always known me as a political officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Anyway, I developed a plan to reorganize the Consular Section and what I needed
                    in terms of equipment to shape up the section, including some additional people.
                    But one of the problems that the Consular Section had was that the previous
                    Ambassador, William Kintner, was so annoyed at seeing long lines of visa
                    applicants around the Embassy that he ordered the Administrative Counselor to
                    “get rid” of the Consular Section. So they moved the Consular Section down to
                    the old Embassy compound, a mile away on Sathorn Road. The old Embassy compound
                    had been taken over by USIS [United States Information Service]. There was an
                    old, wooden building—almost 100 years old—that had been the Embassy Medical
                    Unit. It was so termite-ridden that if you walked up to the second floor to look
                    at the boxes of documents we had up there, the whole building would shake. The
                    GSO [General Services Officer] wouldn't let us put any safes up there because
                    they would come crashing through the ceiling.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the GSO had done a “paint up, fix up” job on this old building, had put
                    carpeting down, and all of that. The Section didn't look all of that bad, but
                    the fact is that we were a mile away from the main Embassy building down a
                    one-way street. Anyway, it was a busy place.</p>
                <p>I made a number of recommendations on how we could turn the situation around and
                    what I needed to do this. Ambassador Whitehouse gave me pretty much a free hand
                    and said to go ahead and do it. I think that I turned the situation around. The
                    Consular Section shaped up, and we performed fairly well after that. Of course,
                    in addition to the refugee problem, we had a constant battle with narcotics and
                    visa fraud. There was a major problem with the security of the Thai passports.
                    The Thai passport was so easily “photo substituted” that it was laughable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could remove the photo and substitute another for
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You issue a visa to a legitimate person, the passport is taken, and you
                    put somebody else's photograph in it. The American immigration officers had no
                    idea what a Thai name means anyway—whether male or female. It was a major
                    problem. We got to the point where we didn't know who the hell we were issuing a
                    visa to. It got so bad that I actually restricted the number of visa applicants
                    to 50 a day, which created a real problem. People were lining up at 4:00 AM to
                    get into the Visa Unit. But I said, “We have to check everybody to whom we're
                    going to issue a visa.”</p>
                <p>I worked very closely with DEA on this problem to try to get a line on the travel
                    agents who were obviously facilitating this [the problem of passport
                    substitution].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: DEA is...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The [U. S.] Drug Enforcement Administration. They had a regional office
                    in Bangkok. I worked very closely with DEA in trying to solve the problem, since
                    many of these fraudulent visas were being used by drug couriers to get into the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>I managed to accomplish two things in that area. It was 1977 before I really
                    began to zero in on the problem. Lorry Lawrence had left London and gone back to
                    the Department to become the Director of the Passport Office, just after Francis
                    Knight retired. He very much wanted the job of Administrator of Consular
                    Affairs. That was his great aim in life. He told me, “If I get to be
                    Administrator, I'll make you my Deputy.” He became Director of the Passport
                    Office.</p>
                <p>I came back for a conference in Washington on prisoner problems overseas. By that
                    time we had about 25 Americans in jail in Thailand for drug smuggling. I told
                    Lorry, “I could use some help in convincing the Thai Passport Office to make a
                    better product, to create a more secure passport.” We had found out that the
                    “crooks” were actually going into the passport office at night to do the photo
                    substitution. The Thai Passport Office put a sheet of plastic laminate over the
                    photo, but that was almost useless as a process, because you could peel the
                    plastic off and paste on the photo you wanted to substitute. Remember, they used
                    to put a grommet through the photo. That provided absolutely no security at
                    all.</p>
                <p>Lorry Lawrence was very good. He sent one of his office directors—one of his unit
                    chiefs—for TDY [Temporary Duty] at no cost to the Embassy to do a study of the
                    Thai Passport Office and make recommendations on how they could reorganize their
                    procedures. We had this recommendation translated into Thai, and the Ambassador
                    gave it to the Thai Foreign Minister with suggestions on how he could improve
                    the quality of the Thai passports. Of course, I had few expectations that the
                    Thai were ever going to do anything to “shape up.”</p>
                <p>Actually, I came up with another scheme, which really solved the problem of
                    “photo substitution.” Do you have time to talk about that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I became almost desperate about this problem of “photo substitution”
                    and concern about whom we were giving these visas to. The problem was
                    underscored, at this time when I was sent back to Los Angeles to testify in
                    Federal Court on the conviction of a Thai drug courier who had been arrested,
                    carrying one of these passports with a visa which had been issued to somebody
                    else.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>One of the few strong points we had to work with in Thailand at that time was the
                    fact that the Thai Government, because of their concern about communists, had
                    created an ID [Identity Card] program in Thailand—much as we had done in
                    Vietnam. Every Thai citizen was issued a laminated Identity Card which was
                    secure. Because it was an anti-communist tool, nobody dared to fool with it. If
                    you fooled with a Thai ID card, they really “lowered the boom” on you. They
                    would let you do anything you wanted to get an American visa. However, if you
                    started fooling around with Thai internal security, they were ruthless about it.
                    So I used to tell my staff in the Consular Section that when they gave a
                    passport back to an applicant with an American visa in it, make the person show
                    you his Thai ID card. We would at least know that we had given the right
                    passport back to the right person.</p>
                <p>After we'd done that for a bit, I had a brain wave and said, “Listen, why don't
                    we do this? Xerox the Thai ID card.” The ID card was written in Thai which looks
                    to most Americans like squiggles. But the photo was there, so you knew who it
                    was. Even if you couldn't read it, you could tell who was the bearer of the ID
                    card. I said, “Xerox the Thai ID card, paste it on the back of our visa form,
                    and attach it, using the U. S. passport 'legend' machine. If they try to remove
                    it, it will destroy the page.” American immigration officials wouldn't even have
                    to look at the Thai passport identity pages. U.S. Immigration needed only to
                    look at the U. S. visa stamp and the xerox of the Thai ID attached to it. This
                    cut the “bad guys” out of the business altogether within a week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, this is Tape 5, Side A, of the interview with Andy
                        Antippas. How about the “boat people” [from Indochina]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: They started coming out, if I recall correctly, early in 1977. I
                    remember when the first boats started showing up on the coast of Thailand. They
                    started building up in camps established under Thai Government authority along
                    the shore of the Kra Isthmus facing the Gulf of Siam. The first reaction of the
                    Ambassador was to put me in charge of the refugee program. In fact, we were
                    creating a refugee program.</p>
                <p>Of course, I was a good soldier and was going to do what I was told. However, I
                    said that I really didn't think that I could do both jobs. I couldn't run a very
                    busy, fraud-ridden Consular Section, with all of the problems we had on that,
                    and try to run a refugee section, unless he gave me a helicopter to ride around
                    in. Just getting around Bangkok was a major task with the constant traffic jams.
                    Traffic was just awful. Since a lot of the refugee work meant direct contact
                    with the Thai in the Ministry of the Interior, you almost had to camp out at the
                    Ministry to deal with this. I told the Ambassador that I really didn't think
                    that I could do it. We needed more people. This was a constant cry of mine in
                    those days: “We need more help if we are going to do the job.”</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Over time the Embassy built up a refugee staff. Lionel Rosenblatt came in to run
                    that effort. I was kind of concerned about that. Not everyone was convinced that
                    Lionel could handle the job, though he ultimately did very well.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I had decided that I would become my own “prisoner” man. I convinced
                    the chief of the Thai prison system to consolidate all of the American prisoners
                    into the penitentiary in Bangkok, which made it easier for me to visit them. You
                    may recall that, at that time, there was a lot of pressure in Congress to do
                    more for American prisoners held in foreign jails, because of the scandals in
                    Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in Mexico.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: So this was “take care of a prisoner week.” We really didn't have
                    enough people to make weekly visits to the prisoners, so I decided that I would
                    handle this activity myself. I felt that I could get more done, being more
                    senior. I really didn't have time to fool around with the refugee program on top
                    of that.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, even though I didn't deal with the refugee program, I ended up
                    creating the “orderly departure” program for Vietnam. After 1976 we in the
                    Consular Section of the Embassy in Bangkok became the recipients of the
                    immigration petitions being filed by Vietnamese in the United States who were
                    obtaining resident or citizenship status and were then able to petition for the
                    admission into the United States of relatives left behind in Vietnam. Since
                    these petitions had to be sent somewhere, the INS started sending them to the
                    Embassy in Bangkok. I set up files on these Vietnamese. In fact, I became the
                    Consular Section for Saigon in Bangkok. It wasn't really a burden for the first
                    couple of years, because there simply wasn't much more to be done than setting
                    up folders and filing them. There was no real action to be taken, since we
                    couldn't see or communicate with the persons concerned.</p>
                <p>Then the communist authorities in Vietnam, for their own reasons, started letting
                    people out legitimately, on Air France aircraft. To deal with this development,
                    we started up the “orderly departure” program, with the approval of the
                    Department, which was hoped would be an alternative to people coming out of
                    Vietnam on boats. The argument was that if you could get out of Vietnam as an
                    immigrant to the U. S., you wouldn't need to take the dangerous trip to Thailand
                    by water, with the perils of the sea, Thai pirates, and all the rest of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>By the time I left Thailand in 1979, there were 5,000 cases on file under the
                    “orderly departure” program—all being managed by my immigrant visa officer. I
                    only had one officer to deal with this whole problem. This was before we were
                    permitted to have people in Saigon to process these applicants. The way it
                    worked was that petitions were approved, and the Vietnamese were allowing them
                    to leave. The Office of the UNHCR, the UN High Commission for Refugees, in
                    Vietnam would take our list of names of people with approved petitions and
                    contact the Vietnamese communist authorities. These people would be allowed to
                    get on aircraft and come to Bangkok, where we would then issue them immigrant
                    visas.</p>
                <p>The arrangement I had was that I would go to the Thai Immigration Office. I would
                    tell the chief of that office that, for example, “The 40 people on this list are
                    coming out of Vietnam next week. We need your permission for them to stay in
                    Bangkok for two weeks, in a hotel near the American Embassy. We'll process them,
                    and I guarantee you that they will all leave Thailand.” So it was on my
                    signature that these people were allowed to come to Thailand to get out of
                    Vietnam and be processed. Of course, I had no control over the U. S. visa
                    process itself. If it turned out that there were medical or other reasons to
                    refuse to issue U. S. visas to these people, there was nothing we could do about
                    it. But that's how the Department wanted it, and that's how it was done. It
                    became such a burden after a while that it was putting a tremendous strain on
                    our ability to handle the visa caseload in Thailand for Thai applicants.</p>
                <p>I started complaining to the Consular Affairs Bureau, saying, “Hey, my officers
                    are here to work on Thailand, not Vietnam. I need help.” As I was a graduate of
                    the system, I knew all of the buttons to push and the telephone calls to make.
                    It was to no avail. I squawked mightily to the Executive Director of the
                    Consular Affairs Bureau.</p>
                <p>Finally, as I came toward the end of my tour of duty in Bangkok, I was
                    increasingly “fed up” with the fact that I was being ignored. The system in the
                    Department of State was placing this terrible burden on us, this non-immigrant
                    visa workload, plus about 2,000 immigrant visas a year. This was not a lot, but
                    it kept one officer pretty busy. But we were getting 20-50 Vietnamese every two
                    weeks. This became a full time job. We had to process them and get them out. I
                    was committed to the Thai Immigration Office to get these people out of
                    Thailand.</p>
                <p>Finally, I told the UNHCR representatives that I wouldn't sign any more letters.
                    I said that I would not give them any more letters to give to the Thai
                    Immigration Office that say that I “guarantee” these people. In effect, I
                    stopped the UNHCR effort to bring out Vietnamese. That really raised a stink.
                    That happened in the summer of 1979, about the time that I was leaving. I didn't
                    plan it that way. It's just the way it worked out.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>There were two issues. One was the scandal that broke out. The Ambassador, Mort
                    Abramowitz, called me up to his office about two weeks before I was due to leave
                    Bangkok. The Regional Director of the DEA was sitting in his office. Mort said,
                    “So and So has told me that So and So, the former chief of your Visa Unit in
                    Bangkok (This individual had left the post in 1978.) made a million dollars
                    selling student visas and was 'planking' the male students.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Planking” the male students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: He was allegedly a homosexual and was sodomizing the male students. I
                    said, “What!!!” I was so shocked that it stunned me to hear that accusation.
                    Mort said that this was from a DEA informant. I said, “Well, the guy left a year
                    ago, and it's a little late for me to do anything about it. We can't set him up
                    and find out if this is really true.”</p>
                <p>I'd gone into this job in Bangkok, aware that the problem of fraud was endemic
                    there. One of the problems which had faced Peg Barnhart [my predecessor] and
                    which had overwhelmed her was that she believed anything that anybody said to
                    her. I had decided that this is how you can really screw yourself up in this
                    kind of a job, if you do that. I felt that I had to defend the Americans in the
                    Consular Section in particular. Maybe not so much as far as the local employees
                    were concerned. As far as the Americans were concerned, unless somebody could
                    show me some proof, I was going to ignore allegations of American
                    corruption.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's endemic in this situation. I was Consul General
                        in Seoul, and the same allegations were made. You're very aware of fraud.
                        However, at the same time, this was a problem in this kind of society. You
                        took what steps you could.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The oldest story in the book is the visa broker who says, “I need an
                    extra thousand dollars for the Consul General.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. What else? The oldest story in the book.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Anybody who's been in this business for any length of time knew that.
                    So I said that, as far as my personal philosophy was concerned, I keep my ears
                    and my door open. I wasn't going to do what Peg Barnhart did, which was close
                    the door. Until somebody can demonstrate to me that he has some actual evidence
                    or a sworn statement, I'm going to ignore all that and let people do their job.
                    I'll do things on a very professional basis.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>The individual officer charged was, in fact, a very tough consular and visa
                    officer. He had a “bad” reputation for being tough, even mean. In fact, the head
                    of USIS [United States Information Service] in Bangkok at the time [Jim
                    McGinley], a very senior USIS officer [He had been the equivalent of an
                    Assistant Secretary of State in USIA in Washington.], said to me, “I've had one
                    public relations problem in this country, and that's your deputy.” So I thought,
                    “He must be doing his job.” He had done one hell of a job, given the situation
                    that I've just described to you.</p>
                <p>It was in that kind of context that I said, “What???” Anyway, I took it as a kind
                    of personal vote of confidence that Ambassador Abramowitz had told me all this.
                    That was in 1979. In 1989 I would have been strung up by the thumbs by the
                    Inspector General as probably being part and parcel of any “scam” that was going
                    on! At the same time I was outraged that this allegation might have been true,
                    because a lot of things and recollections then started falling into place.</p>
                <p>I knew that this individual, for example, didn't particularly like women. Bangkok
                    is a bachelor's heaven. You might want to die and go to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came to Bangkok for a consular conference. I saw things
                        that I had never imagined.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: This was what the Vietnam War was all about, in case you were
                    wondering. It was to save Bangkok. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>I had a good time there. I know that this guy didn't have any girlfriends. So
                    little things like that sort of fell into place. We all know about the guy who
                    can be very tough as a visa officer and, at the same time, is doing all kinds of
                    things out the back door. Anything is possible, given human nature.</p>
                <p>So I delayed my departure from Bangkok for two weeks to initiate the
                    investigation, working closely with the Embassy Security Officer. In those days
                    we really worked together. We weren't viewed as “enemies,” which is the system
                    now, where everybody is suspect.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>I started by interrogating my Thai staff. I'll never forget the reaction I got
                    from my Thai secretary. I had an American and a Thai secretary. I said to my
                    Thai secretary, “Vorapon, you knew this guy very well.” I was very blunt about
                    what I was looking for. I said, “You knew this guy very well, and I know that
                    you people didn't like him. I know that very few people liked him. Why didn't
                    you come to me? You know that I tried to do a lot to improve the conditions at
                    work [in the Consular Section].” I had arranged to have an air conditioned bus
                    assigned to the Consulate to take people to the Embassy for lunch. I had a
                    shelter built outside so that people wouldn't have to stand in the rain waiting
                    for the American staff to come and open up the office. I did lots of little
                    things like that to try to improve working conditions. I worked hard to get
                    people promotions, money, and all the rest. I said, “How come you didn't come to
                    me and tell me what you suspected?” She said, “Oh, Mr. Antippas, he was always
                    so close to you.” Sure. He'd come into my office, and we'd talk about specific
                    cases, tell “war stories,” or whatever. He was my deputy. Obviously, I'd spend a
                    lot of time talking to him. The implication of that statement was that maybe I
                    was “bent” as well.</p>
                <p>I must say that was a shock. It was really a shock. I never went back to Bangkok
                    until last spring when I had occasion to go to Vietnam and went through Bangkok.
                    What turned me off was just that reaction. I was so personally angered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the case proven against this man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No. The Department never made a case. t. We dealt basically with the
                    Embassy Security Officer [SY]. I went to the SY guy who was handling this case
                    in Washington. I said, “Look, I'll do anything I can to help you. If you want me
                    to go back [to the Thailand] to help in the investigation, I'll go back, since I
                    know people there.” He said, “Look, basically, we don't have a case against this
                    guy. This is a year after he left the post.” This officer heard that he was
                    under investigation and the first thing that he did was to get himself a lawyer.
                    Then the Department backed off, because it had no evidence. In fact, that
                    officer was subsequently promoted. So as far as I know, he's still in the
                    Foreign Service. So I don't know. I may be abusing him as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One never knows in these matters, because allegations of
                        this kind are endemic to the situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. You're taking the word of an unidentified “informant.” I
                    thought about my Bangkok experience when I left Seoul, for example. I thought
                    that, even though you try to do a straightforward job and try to be a “tough”
                    American Consul General who protects American interests or what you think are
                    American interests, people out there may hate you and try to ruin your
                    reputation. I'm talking about the local “crooks” whose income you are hurting,
                    but basically that's your job.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I remember leaving Seoul saying to myself, “You know, I think that I'm going to
                    leave here with my reputation intact.” I had been tough. I ran a really “tight”
                    ship in Seoul, given the problems that you know very well. In fact, I left Seoul
                    with my reputation intact, with an excellent reputation, and with lots of
                    recognition for what I had done there.</p>
                <p>I felt very personally hurt by this whole thing in Bangkok. However, the point of
                    this is that the system at that time was that if you didn't have a case to make
                    against an officer, you close the file, you go onto other things, and you don't
                    ruin the guy's reputation. Now maybe there's another book that the Department
                    keeps somewhere with a “black mark” on it somewhere. As we've noted, this is
                    endemic in the system and you just can't get do anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left the Embassy in Bangkok in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The summer of 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I had applied for the job of Consul General in Seoul, which you had
                    held. You may remember that my son has a learning disability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. We talked about it. The Eighth Army had a school or
                        facility that might have been helpful for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That's right. My problem was trying to arrange telephonic communication
                    between the Embassy in Bangkok and Seoul. The problem was more a matter of
                    getting through to Yongsan. I could get in touch with Seoul, but as far as
                    getting in touch with Yongsan was concerned, I think that the problem was that
                    the telephone system was run on batteries. We could never have a conversation. I
                    waited so long to accept your job that the Department gave it to Lou Goelz, who
                    came out of the Embassy in Tehran. So they offered me Lou's job in Tehran. I
                    thought, “Hell, no, I don't want to go to Iran”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just before the events [of December, 1979] when
                        the Embassy in Tehran was taken over. You would have been one of the
                        hostages held there for 444 days.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That's right. Dick Morefield took the job and got to stay in Tehran for
                    all of that time. Anyway, I tried to get the Consul General job in Montreal
                    because Tom Enders was Ambassador to Canada at that time. I told him that I'd
                    really like to go there. He said, “You don't have enough rank. You can't get
                    that job.” I think I was also dickering for the job of Consul General in
                    Guayaquil, [Ecuador]. Your predecessor in Saigon was Consul General in
                    Guayaquil. I thought that I'd study Spanish and go to Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>One other thing that I was considering. Through all of that refugee work, I had
                    gotten to know the staff at Senator Teddy Kennedy's subcommittee, and
                    particularly Jerry Tinker, who recently died. You may have seen the notice in
                    the press. Jerry was the staff director for Kennedy. Through working on refugees
                    since Cambodia, we got to know each other quite well. I said to Tinker, “How
                    about a Pearson assignment to the refugee subcommittee?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Pearson assignment was a personnel detail to familiarize
                        Foreign Service Officers with jobs in other parts of the government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Particularly in Congress. I was “dickering” for a job like this with
                    both Harry Barnes, then Director General of the Foreign Service, and with
                    Senator Kennedy's office. It didn't work out. I don't remember why it didn't
                    work out because, in fact, the suggestion was warmly received. It was probably a
                    question of slots. Anyhow, I ended up with no job when I came back to
                    Washington. My wife was absolutely furious.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to the newly created Refugee Bureau, a job which I really didn't
                    want to do. I really had “had” it with refugee work at that point. Part and
                    parcel of that job was that the Department discovered the existence of a famine
                    in Cambodia, so it created another office called the “Kampuchea Working Group.”
                    So I was assigned to that. Cambodia was a labor of love, and I got very involved
                    with it.</p>
                <p>Before finishing up on my assignment to Bangkok, let me tell you about the case
                    of Bobby Garwood. For many years, beginning with the Johnson administration and
                    right through the Nixon and Carter administrations, Frank Sieverts was the
                    POW/MIA [Prisoners of War/Missing in Action] guy in the State Department. He is
                    now press spokesman for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He had done the
                    POW/MIA job for many years. I knew him from my Indochina days.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Frank Sieverts got in touch with us in the Embassy in Bangkok and told us that
                    Garwood, a Marine Corps private who had been taken prisoner in 1965, relatively
                    early in the war, had stayed behind in Vietnam. He had never been returned with
                    the other POW's in 1973. He was viewed by some people as a “turncoat” and a
                    collaborator with the communists. He had gotten a message out that he wanted to
                    return to the United States. It turned out that the Vietnamese communists were
                    going to permit him to return to the U. S. Working through the UN Office in
                    Saigon, we learned that he would come out through Bangkok. I was scheduled to
                    receive him, as the Consul General, protecting an American citizen.</p>
                <p>Frank Sieverts' view was that I should accompany Garwood to Okinawa on a
                    commercial flight. During the flight, I would try to debrief him. He would
                    obviously be in a certain amount of shock—culture shock, if nothing else. It was
                    thought that a low key approach, talking to him about other, missing Americans
                    or people he had known about or had knowledge of might easily be done that way
                    without making it too “structured.”</p>
                <p>I agreed to that approach. However, by the time that Garwood left Vietnam for
                    Bangkok, some lawyer in Garwood's hometown took it upon himself to tell
                    Garwood's family that he [the lawyer] would represent him on a contingency basis
                    and that Garwood should have legal representation. This lawyer, in fact,
                    enlisted himself as Garwood's attorney. He told the Pentagon, in effect, “You
                    can't talk to my client without me being present.”</p>
                <p>So the whole “game plan” was thrown out the window. The Marine Corps sent down a
                    C-130 transport aircraft from Okinawa with a legal officer to receive Garwood.
                    My basic job was to take Garwood from the civilian side of Don Muang Airport in
                    Bangkok to the other, military side of the airport and turn him over to the
                    Marines, which I did. I stood there while he was being “read his rights.” I
                    signed a receipt for him. I have a picture of myself, standing in the C-130,
                    turning Garwood over to the Marines.</p>
                <p>Garwood really was in a state of shock when he got off the Air France plane from
                    Saigon. The Air France stewardesses had taken pity on him, given him a lot of
                    champagne and all the rest, and he was somewhat “ga-ga” by the time he got off
                    the plane. My plan had been to take him out through a side entrance [at Don
                    Muang airport terminal in Bangkok], put him in an Embassy car, drive around the
                    airfield to the military side, where the C-130 was waiting, and turn him over to
                    the Marines. I would suggest to him that he say no more than, “I'm pleased to be
                    going home. I'll make a statement later.”</p>
                <p>We were greeted by such a phalanx of journalists and TV cameramen, who almost
                    overran us, that I grabbed Garwood by the elbow, propelled him right through the
                    crowd, in the process trampling several of these journalists, got him into the
                    Embassy car, and got the hell out of there. My picture appeared in the papers
                    all over the world, propelling Garwood through the crowd. I got a lot of letters
                    from friends, saying, “Now we know where you are.”</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>There was a great debate about whether or not he had “collaborated” with the
                    Vietnamese communists. Garwood's story now is that he was, in fact, kept a
                    prisoner and was not allowed to leave. He said that he had really “conned” his
                    way out of Vietnam. His book on his experiences was “ghost written” by somebody
                    else. It didn't seem terribly accurate, in my view. It's an interesting story
                    but leaves a lot to be desired. I still think that we would have learned a lot
                    about missing Americans, had I been allowed to debrief him. In fact, everything
                    was put “on ice” for a long time afterwards, and all of his defenses went
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American prisoners held in jail in Bangkok?
                        What was their condition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was a tough scene. When I left Bangkok, there were 25 Americans held
                    in prison there. Besides being a prisoner, being a Thai prisoner in particular
                    is something I wouldn't want. Part of the problem was that they could still get
                    drugs very easily in prison through corrupt guards. Many of them were drug
                    addicts. I had recommended strongly to the Department that we be permitted to
                    set up a program in the Thai jail to get them off hard drugs, using “Methadone.”
                    I tried to work things out so that we would manage funds that would be sent by
                    their families. The Thai would only permit them to have a certain amount of
                    money—to buy necessary items from the prison store.</p>
                <p>One of my jobs was to make sure that they behaved themselves and treated the Thai
                    with the deference that was expected of prisoners. Many of the Americans were
                    really obstreperous and created additional problems for themselves because of
                    their behavior in jail. Sometimes, when they would talk back to me, I would
                    “bawl them out.” This would be in the presence of the Thai guards, which the
                    Thai appreciated. The American prisoners were pretty much a bunch of
                    rapscallions.</p>
                <p>I went to the American community in Bangkok, through the American Chamber of
                    Commerce, and asked for some funds to support a “slush fund” to make it possible
                    to buy necessities for them. Some of the prisoners had no money at all. I wanted
                    to have a little money so that we could buy them at least a few things to make
                    life easier for them, to the extent that it was permitted. I remember getting a
                    very negative reaction from the American business community. They said, more or
                    less, “Screw those bastards, those dope peddlers.” I would say, “Now, wait a
                    minute. I'm as strong a believer as anybody is in being 'tough' on narcotics.
                    However, I want to tell you. If I didn't exist, the American Consul who goes out
                    there to defend these guys, you'd have to invent me. There has to be at least
                    one guy in this Embassy who will protect people. What happens to the person who
                    is unjustly accused? The Thai simply lock him up and throw the key away? What
                    would happen if your son were in that situation? You'd come crying to me and
                    say, 'This kid isn't a dope addict. You've got to protect him.'” If I simply
                    said, “Well, screw you, he's an accused dope peddler or whatever. The Thai can
                    throw the key away.” I said that somebody has to be here who doesn't have that
                    attitude.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>I had a couple of cases of people who were “set up” by taxi drivers and all of
                    that. They were thrown into jail. Because of my efforts, I got them off. Those
                    cases are in my official files. There were letters written to the Secretary of
                    State regarding people who were unjustly jailed, and I got them out of prison.
                    They were legitimate citizens. I made that argument to people [in the American
                    community in Bangkok], but not terribly successfully. The prisoners really were
                    an unsavory bunch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bangkok had a reputation of being a “hot bed” of drugs and
                        sex for high school kids. We had a lot of American dependents there. Did you
                        get involved in that, or was that somebody else's responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was really not directly my job. We did have a problem with some of
                    the American dependents—children getting involved with drugs. We had a couple of
                    kids take LSD and walk off the roof of the International School of Bangkok
                    [ISB]. In fact, the Department began a program for treatment of such people
                    because of the problems in Bangkok, which, as you say, was a “hot bed.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that didn't fall under your responsibilities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It didn't fall directly under my job. I just felt that I ought to do
                    something. It would have been a major problem to visit all of the jails in the
                    provinces. There was no way that I could have afforded the manpower to do that.
                    I don't know whether it was the best idea to corral all of these guys together
                    or not. I suspect that they “fed” on each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that this is always a problem. If they are off
                        somewhere by themselves, they tend to calm down and blend into the local
                        scene.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: But after I left Bangkok, the regional DEA office did some soul
                    searching. Through their efforts they doubled the prison population, principally
                    with people accused of drug offenses, the year after I left. I took a strong
                    position about not “setting people up” and trying to protect Americans in that
                    regard. I had enough credibility with DEA because I worked very closely with
                    them. In fact, I got an award from DEA for the work I did with them in Bangkok.
                    I think that they were very careful about not “setting up” Americans. I told
                    DEA, “Look, don't put these guys away here because you can't put them away in
                    the United States.” I was very much in favor of having a prisoner exchange
                    agreement between Thailand and the United States. I wanted to send these people
                    home. I didn't want them in Bangkok. They were not a consular problem. They were
                    an American social problem.</p>

                        1979 when you came back to work with [Indochinese] refugees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: And famine relief.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 5, 1994. Andy, as we mentioned last time,
                        you came back to the Department in 1979. How long were you with refugee
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I spent a year there. Actually, I was in Washington from 1979 to 1981,
                    because I was assigned to the National War College in that last year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I had been trying to consider too many possibilities in 1979 in terms
                    of getting an overseas assignment. We wanted to remain overseas. My wife
                    preferred to stay overseas, and that was my preference, too. I was also under
                    consideration for assignment to the Bipartisan Immigration Commission, under
                    Father Hesburgh, the President of Notre Dame University at that time. The
                    commission had been set up here in Washington to study immigration problems. I
                    don't remember why that didn't work out, either. The end of the story is that I
                    ended up in the brand-new Refugee Bureau, which had a title but not much of
                    anything else. It hardly had space in the building. As I said before, I was not
                    much interested in working on refugee matters. I really felt kind of “burned
                    out” in this respect, however, as I also mentioned, the world was discovering
                    that Cambodia was starving to death. The Vietnamese communists, who had invaded
                    the country in 1978 and chased out Pol Pot, the Cambodian communist leader,
                    became involved in a very small but “hot” war with the Khmer Rouges. The
                    situation was so confused that people were actually starving to death in
                    Cambodia. There was a lot of pressure on for the world community to “do
                    something.” The Carter administration decided that we should help out.</p>
                <p>The unit designated to do this was called the Kampuchea Working Group, a kind of
                    task force. The Director was Tom Barnes, an experienced and senior political
                    officer who had served in Vietnam. They made him the Director of this working
                    group, and I was assigned as Deputy Director, since I was one of the few people
                    around Washington who could find Cambodia on the map and knew what had happened
                    in that sad place.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>We began to work very hard and put in long hours in the summer and fall of 1979.
                    The horror of what was going on in Cambodia came to light. It was an interesting
                    experience. In fact, I spent most of my time proselytizing and going out and
                    talking to people. Somehow, very little was really known about the situation
                    inside Cambodia. I appeared on the “Good Morning, America” TV show twice to talk
                    about Cambodia. I made trips outside of Washington such as Albuquerque, New
                    Mexico, where former Secretary of State Dean Rusk's son was mayor. I spoke to a
                    group about Cambodia. I also went to Santa Barbara, California and Chicago.
                    Anyway, I traveled around, spreading the good word about why people should help
                    Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I won't dwell on this effort to any great extent, but the major problem was that
                    the administration had to find money for food relief in Cambodia. There was no
                    money in the budget for this purpose. There was the usual shuffle of budget
                    funds. Now, Cambodia is not a very big place—more or less the size of Missouri.
                    It's not hard to get around. It's not particularly mountainous, and the roads
                    are not that bad. There are a lot of natural reasons why nobody should be
                    starving to death in that country.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese communists made it very difficult for the aid program to get food
                    into Cambodia. We were working on plans, for example, to fly C-5 planes [very
                    large, four-engine U. S. Air Force transport aircraft] into Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are our largest transport aircraft.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Our biggest job was to find rice which we could obtain immediately for
                    delivery to Cambodia. We went to the Japanese Government, which had enormous
                    stocks of rice—government sponsored and purchased rice which was very expensive.
                    About the most expensive rice in the world is in Japan. They had mountains of
                    it. There was the inexplicable fact that they said that they couldn't afford to
                    give the rice away, because it cost so much to buy it from the Japanese farmers.
                    The hardest problem was getting permission from the Vietnamese to deliver rice
                    to Cambodia.</p>
                <p>We had the prospect of Russian-donated “red corn” from Argentina, which was
                    impregnated with DDT [insecticide]. It was fit only for cattle but it was being
                    delivered for human consumption in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Finally, in desperation the UN and the voluntary agencies set up feeding stations
                    on the Thai-Cambodian border, where a lot of Cambodian refugees were heading,
                    anyway. This created even larger magnets attracting Cambodians to come to
                    Thailand. The poor Thai ended up with over 100,000 refugees in their laps.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>I spent a year working on Cambodian famine relief under the Carter
                    administration. That was the year, you might recall, when the Department in an
                    excess of conservation zeal, turned down the heat in the building and half the
                    lights. Everybody was going around, wearing sweaters. The Under Secretary for
                    Management, Dick Moose, was wearing a sweater. There wasn't a drop of hot water
                    in the bathrooms. It was all a little unseemly.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was rewarded for all of my efforts by being assigned to the National
                    War College, which had been a long-held aspiration for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andy, just one thing. When you were working on Cambodian
                        relief, how did you find the support from, say, other elements in the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Actually, this wasn't a particular problem. I can't recall any
                    particular difficulty in that connection. We had the manpower assigned to us—a
                    “pick up” team of the kind you usually get for a task force. The biggest problem
                    we had was that the Department kept moving us around. We were set up in offices
                    on the sixth floor, where the Bureau of East Asian Affairs was. Then they moved
                    us to the international conference suite [on the ground floor of the
                    Department]. From time to time they would need that space, and we would have to
                    move elsewhere. It was really a kind of bureaucratic “shuffle.” I think that
                    everybody was kind of understanding and helpful. I don't have any particular
                    recollection of the State Department giving us a hard time on this. Everybody
                    was sympathetic about the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which war college did you attend?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The National War College at Ft. McNair, in Washington. I was initially
                    assigned to the Industrial College of the Armed Forces [ICAF]. A friend of mine
                    in Personnel handled the assignment. I asked if I could be switched over to the
                    National War College, and he arranged it. My understanding of the Industrial
                    College is that they work awfully hard. [Laughter] At the Industrial College you
                    really had to have your head on your shoulders as far as logistics and
                    mathematics were concerned. I wasn't sure that was what I really wanted.</p>
                <p>The National War College was a very satisfying experience. It came during my 19th
                    or 20th year in the Foreign Service. At that point I was 48 or 49 years old—a
                    bit older than my classmates from the military and peers in the Foreign Service,
                    as well. Still, it came at about the right time for me in terms of giving me a
                    “respite” from the work that I had been doing in the Foreign Service. It
                    coincided with the 1980 presidential elections campaign, which is a marvelous
                    time to be at the War College. We heard well-qualified people come and discuss
                    world issues with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>That was the year when the authorities decided that our class would have to write
                    a “paper.” This business of doing a “paper” at the War College is an on again,
                    off again kind of thing. It was my luck that year we had to do a paper. No one
                    in the class really wanted to work that hard. I remember that the State
                    Department adviser at the National War College told us that, since the War
                    College came under the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if we would do a paper which the
                    JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff] would like to have done, there might be a little
                    stipend involved for research and travel. Therefore, we were all requested to
                    prepare an outline of a “paper.” Obviously, it was a very thinly disguised
                    excuse for getting us to prepare for a “paper” which otherwise we wouldn't have
                    done.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I thought about what I would like to write. I decided that, having had
                    all of this experience with Cambodia during the previous 10 years, I would do a
                    kind of “cathartic” paper on Cambodia and get this “devil” out of my system.
                    Since we were in a military atmosphere, I decided to do a paper on the Nixon
                    administration's decision to “rearm” Lon Nol. This involved reviewing the “Nixon
                    Doctrine” of 1969-1970. It would be a “friendly” paper, since I had pretty much
                    agreed with the policy while I was in Cambodia. I decided that I would try to
                    talk to all of the “key” players—everyone that I could reach—and ask them, 10
                    years after the fact, what they had thought and why they did what they did.
                    Basically, I was not out to “sandbag” anybody.My advisor told me that the JCS
                    staff were not interested in my topic and therefore I would not qualify for a
                    stipend because it was “too historical”. That really amused me. It didn't really
                    bother me because I wasn't intending to work that hard. I did say “you mean we
                    as a nation will never get involved in some dusty little country where we will
                    use others as surrogates to fight for our interests?” I was of course referring
                    to the hot issue of the time—El Salvador. This whole episode was very
                    instructive and insightful about how our government operates. We spend fortunes
                    in collecting, filing and retrieving information but basically we don't really
                    want to know how or why we did a particular thing in the past. The political
                    overhead doesn't want to be told why they should not do a particular policy
                    because of why something like it had been attempted in the past.</p>
                <p>I wrote letters to various people. Those in the State Department were very easy
                    to get to: Marshall Green, U. Alexis Johnson, Tom Pickering (who had been in PM
                    at the time) Mike Rives, Fred Ladd, General Ted Metaxis( the first MEDTC
                    Chief)—all of them were available and quite willing to talk about the decision
                    to rearm Lon Nol. The key CIA people such as John Stein and Ted Shackley were
                    also available. The political people were more of a problem. I wrote to Melvin
                    Laird [former Secretary of Defense]. He begged off and said that he was not
                    involved in Cambodia at the time and that I should talk to Larry Eagleburger,
                    who had been Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security
                    Affairs. I wrote to Henry Kissinger and to Alexander Haig. Kissinger agreed to
                    receive me and be interviewed about our Cambodian policy but never did because
                    as I later learned he was writing his own book. Haig begged off because, by that
                    time, Ronald Reagan had won the election, and Haig had been nominated to be
                    Secretary of State. He said that he was too busy preparing for his confirmation
                    hearings. I still have Haig's letter, which was written in what came to be known
                    as “Haigspeak.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Haig was renowned for his confusing syntax.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. I had gotten to know him slightly during my Cambodian
                    experience. The one person I didn't try to reach—and I regretted this later—was
                    former President Nixon. For one thing, I thought that he probably wouldn't
                    receive me. What would he say that wouldn't be a defense of what he did? But not
                    attempting to contact Nixon was a mistake on my part. I should have followed my
                    instincts, which were to try to see him.</p>
                <p>Some years later—I think that it was in 1985 or 1986—when I was Consul General in
                    Seoul, Nixon came to Korea on a visit. There was a reception at the Ambassador's
                    residence where Nixon gave a short talk. This was really the first time that I
                    had a chance to listen personally to Nixon other than briefly in Thailand in
                    December 1969. It was very interesting to hear him talk. He spoke about the
                    first time he had come to Korea in 1953 during his first tour of Asia as
                    Eisenhower's Vice President. I went up to him after the reception and introduced
                    myself. I said, “You know, you probably don't hear this very much, but you were
                    right about Cambodia.” He did a double take and looked at me. I explained who I
                    was and what I had done, serving in Cambodia. I said, “I was a Political Officer
                    in our tiny Embassy in Phnom Penh. We would go out in the morning and try to
                    find out what was happening during the first month or two of the war. Then we
                    would go back to the Embassy and dictate telegraphic reports on what we had
                    learned. We discovered that you were reading these reports. So we had to 'clean
                    up' the grammar.” He got a big laugh out of that. He slapped me on the back and
                    said, “Give me your card. I'm going to send you a copy of my latest book, 'No
                    More Vietnams.” He did. He sent me an autographed copy of the book, plus a
                    couple of other books as well.</p>
                <p>I said to him, “I really regret that I did not come to talk to you during my stay
                    at the War College about the decisions made in 1970 about going into Cambodia.”
                    He indicated that he would have received me and would have liked to talk about
                    it. He said that I was right. Not very many people understood that the objective
                    was not to overthrow Sihanouk. Under the circumstances and to save American
                    lives, we had to do what we did. I am persuaded that he was right about this.
                    That's not a popular view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I happen to subscribe to that view. I don't see what else
                        we could have done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: We just couldn't have walked out of Cambodia. Anyway, I spent the first
                    six months of my National War College assignment observing the national
                    elections campaign in 1980. It was fascinating. Then I spent a lot of time doing
                    the research and talking to people for my paper. I managed to finish it, and it
                    wasn't half bad. I'm fairly proud of it. It allowed me to review my own thinking
                    about what our government could have done in terms of supporting Lon Nol at a
                    very difficult time.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Then we had our overseas trip. You'll recall that I came to visit you in Naples
                    as part of my “boondoggle.” I decided to pick Italy and Greece because I knew
                    that I'd never be assigned to either place in my Foreign Service career, so I
                    might as well go there. You were kind enough to receive me in Naples.</p>
                <p>I think that finishing up the National War College assignment was an interesting
                    commentary in itself on how the Foreign Service works. Starting in April 1981, I
                    was busily looking for an ongoing assignment. This is always difficult to do and
                    was especially so at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. They always promise you the moon when you enter a war
                        college. You're a “picked person,” they say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You're in the elite of the elite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you come out, and they say, “Who are you?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I was walking the halls of the State Department, like everybody else.
                    Tom Enders, who had been my boss in Phnom Penh and who, obviously, was very much
                    on the “fast track,” from the promotional point of view, had been nominated to
                    be Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs. I asked him if he
                    would support me for the job of Principal Officer in Guadalajara, Mexico. I said
                    that I didn't speak Spanish. However, the Guadalajara position was due to open
                    up in the fall of 1981. If I could get this job, I would have time to take a
                    course in Spanish. We have this “chicken and egg” situation in the Foreign
                    Service. You can't compete for a job unless you speak the language, and you
                    can't take a course in the language unless you have the job.</p>
                <p>I was keen to go overseas, and so was my wife. She hadn't been very happy about
                    coming back to the U. S. in the first place. The Consular Affairs Bureau wanted
                    Director of the Visa Office, Julio Arias, to go to Guadalajara. This was kind of
                    his “swan song” as well. I remember thinking to myself, “Well, I'm not about to
                    'sandbag' Julio Arias. When I'm in his situation, I hope that somebody is
                    thoughtful enough to take care of me when I'm near the end of my career.”</p>
                <p>So I accepted the job of Consul General in Seoul, which was opening up. Lou Goelz
                    really hadn't liked Seoul very much, had stayed only for about a year, and was
                    going on to do something else. Vern McAninch replaced Lou Goelz but Vern didn't
                    like Seoul, either. He was a Latin American hand and a real gay blade. I guess
                    that he didn't like the weather, though I don't know. There are a lot of
                    problems in Seoul, of course. So I decided to take Seoul and accepted the job of
                    Consul General. Vern and I, in fact, talked back and forth by phone about the
                    “overlap.” He was going to have a reception for me and introduce me to
                    everybody.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>On the morning that I was to graduate from the National War College I was trying
                    to get my family out the door to get down to the graduation ceremony. We all had
                    to be in our seats at 7:45 AM. Right at this time I got a call from Personnel in
                    the Department, asking me if I would like to be charg� d'affaires in the
                    Bahamas. I had forgotten that the previous year, on my list of preferences, I
                    had put down the position of DCM in the Bahamas. This position was opening up,
                    but I thought that I didn't have a prayer of getting the job. It turned out that
                    Tom Enders had seen my name on the list of people who had applied for the job.
                    He offered the position to me. Judy and I had to think about it a little bit
                    because of the schooling question. But the Department allowed me to “break” the
                    assignment to Seoul, which I did.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I got down to the National War College late, missed the graduation, but
                    went to the reception afterwards. The Commandant was pleased to hear that I had
                    gotten a very nice assignment. We had a special little ceremony under the dome
                    of the college, where he gave me my diploma. So I left with very nice thoughts
                    about the experience at the National War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Bahamas. That's Nassau, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Nassau. There was no Ambassador at the post when I arrived there in
                    July 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was to be a four-year assignment as DCM: two years, followed by home
                    leave, and then return for another two years. In fact, it turned out that I was
                    charg� d'affaires there for the best part of two years. A political appointee
                    was assigned as Ambassador. There's a lot to say about the Bahamas, which says a
                    lot about how the State Department, the Foreign Service, and the White House
                    work. I would say that the Bahamas was my most interesting assignment by
                    far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that. What was the situation in the
                        Bahamas when you went out? Was there any particular thing that you were
                        supposed to concentrate on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I originally figured—my God! The Bahamas! People tend to confuse
                    Bermuda and the Bahamas as being the same sort of place with people running
                    around in “Bermuda shorts” and swinging golf clubs. I figured that the biggest
                    problem I would have as charg� d'affaires or even as DCM in the Bahamas would be
                    practicing my tennis backhand. I figured that it was really going to be a
                    two-year or four-year vacation. I had known some people who had served in the
                    Bahamas and so knew a little bit about the place, particularly when I was in the
                    Consular Affairs Bureau as special assistant to the director.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>We had had an American who had been sentenced to death for murdering an American
                    tourist in Nassau. The murderer was apparently insane. I remember the great
                    effort that was made by the Department to save this clown's life. The Bahamian
                    Attorney General said, “Hell, no.” And they hanged him. I also knew that we had
                    tried to get Robert Vesco out of the Bahamas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Vesco was an international financier cum crook.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: He had ripped off $220 million from the IOS [a U. S. private investment
                    service] and an investment fund. So it was more of a law enforcement kind of
                    place, but very much consular oriented. In fact, in Bangkok one of the visa
                    scandals which I had helped to uncover was a fraudulent immigration visa racket
                    worked out of New York by a Chinese-American lawyer and the American Consul in
                    the Bahamas. The Consul was going into his office early in the morning and
                    writing up phony immigration visas. He was subsequently tried and convicted of
                    fraud, due in part to the evidence which I helped to uncover in Bangkok. So I
                    had a little knowledge of the Bahamas and I thought that it would be an
                    interesting place to serve.</p>
                <p>The biggest bilateral problem that we had when I arrived in the Bahamas was the
                    completion of the negotiations on the military base agreement. In the 1940
                    50-destroyer deal...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an agreement reached with Great Britain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: 50 [World War I] destroyers were exchanged for 99 year leases on bases
                    in the West Indies, including the Bahamas. Britain gave us 99 year leases on a
                    variety of locations in the Caribbean which we could use for military bases.
                    Most of those bases were not particularly useful after World War II. The
                    facilities in the Bahamas were, particularly for the space program, because we
                    set up tracking stations for Cape Canaveral (Cape Kennedy) in several downrange
                    locations through the Bahamian archipelago. In fact, all of the way down through
                    the Turks and Caicos Islands, which are part of the same archipelago. As
                    important as the tracking stations, was a naval test facility in the body of
                    water between Andros and New Providence Islands.</p>
                <p>When the Bahamas became independent in 1973, we were to start paying for the use
                    of the facilities. The tracking stations were of declining interest because, as
                    technology changed in the space program, particularly the use of satellites, we
                    didn't really need these stations as land-based facilities down-range from Cape
                    Kennedy. What was of particular importance though was what they called the
                    “AUTEC” facility, which is an acronym for the “Atlantic Underseas Test and
                    Evaluation Center.”</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>In fact, the body of water between New Providence Island, which is where Nassau
                    is located, and Andros Island, the largest island in the Bahamas, is almost a
                    land-locked lake. It is up to 6000 feet deep. Because it is mostly surrounded by
                    land masses, reefs, and sand bars, it is like a giant test pool. It was ideal—in
                    fact, unique in the world—for its clarity, depth, and size to allow the
                    sound-testing of submarines. The most important thing about using submarines is
                    that they need to be silent. Even nuclear vessels make noises with equipment and
                    propellers. You could run a whole naval battle group in that area. They did a
                    lot of “war gaming” there. It was only two days' steam from Norfolk, VA. So it
                    was a very important facility. The U. S. Navy very much wanted to improve the
                    infrastructure there but couldn't do so because we hadn't completed the bases
                    agreement. The Carter administration had been involved in negotiations with the
                    newly independent, Bahamian Government over the terms. It was thought that we
                    had finally worked out the rental agreement.</p>
                <p>So when I went to the Bahamas, my instructions were to find out where and when
                    they wanted to sign this agreement. The Reagan administration was now in office.
                    One of the first things that I did, when I assumed charge of the Embassy, was to
                    send a diplomatic note to the Bahamian Government saying, “I've been instructed
                    to ask, etc, etc.” I received no response, which I found very curious.
                    Obviously, this was a fairly big deal, in that we were going to be paying the
                    Bahamian Government something like ten million dollars annually for the use of
                    these bases. The payments were not to be retroactive either. Moreover, we
                    couldn't improve the bases until we had a signed agreement, because Congress
                    wouldn't allow us to do so. That is one part of the larger story of the
                    difficulty I encountered over the next several months.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Nassau in mid July 1981. I discovered that all was not sweetness and
                    light between the United States and the Bahamas. It turned out that the Foreign
                    Minister felt that he had been “hornswoggled” in some fashion, as far as the
                    agreement on the payment schedule was concerned. In a word, what he wanted was a
                    guarantee that over the 10-year life of the agreement, the Bahamas was going to
                    get their $100 million under the payment schedule. On our side we said that we
                    could not “guarantee” $100 million because of our legislative budget
                    arrangements and budget cycle. There's no way to “guarantee” that the payments
                    will be made during the life of the agreement. In other words, we could not
                    legally “guarantee” payments of $10 million per year for 10 years. He was “sore”
                    about that. He felt that the Bahamas might be cheated.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was really kind of an academic point. However, to show you how these
                    guys operated, the Attorney General of the Bahamas was concurrently Foreign
                    Minister. This made it kind of complicated, because he was the guy we most
                    frequently dealt with in the Bahamas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Paul Adderly. I crossed swords with this individual on numerous
                    occasions. He was a little bit “nuts,” actually, but an absolutely brilliant and
                    knowledgeable individual. He understood how the U. S. Government worked. He was
                    a pretty good politician for the Bahamas but he really was a case. Some of the
                    American VIP's who visited the Bahamas and whom I escorted to call on him were
                    just “flabbergasted” by his attitude.</p>
                <p>Anyway, on the base agreement issue I was absolutely stunned to find that the man
                    would not answer a direct question about what his problem was. Here I was, the
                    new American Charg� d'Affaires. What I didn't know about the Bahamas would fill
                    a book. There was a new American administration in office in Washington [the
                    Reagan administration]. All of the arrangements had been made under the previous
                    administration [President Carter]. He knew that. I would come and ask him a
                    simple, direct, bilateral question. He would not even answer the question, even
                    when I asked him directly, to his face. I would ask, “Can you tell me what your
                    problem is?” He wouldn't answer. It became very, very frustrating, to say the
                    least. However, I didn't consider it a personal failing on my part.Over time I
                    began to discover that there were other problems for the United States in the
                    Bahamas.</p>
                <p>After my first 90 days at post I sat down and wrote a 10-page telegram,
                    describing my impressions of what our relations were with this country. I have a
                    copy of this report. I managed to get it out of the files before I retired. I
                    thought that it was a rather good report. I described all of the problems and
                    the attitudes which I had encountered. My conclusion in this cable was, “The
                    Bahamas is no friend of the United States.”</p>
                <p>This was before we had even begun to realize the enormity of the narcotics
                    trafficking which was taking place in the Bahamas. We already had some idea of
                    the “money laundering” that was going on, since the Bahamas was an offshore
                    banking center. I was also beginning to discover, to my horror, how big a
                    transit area it was for illegal immigration into the United States. Even then,
                    the Haitian problem was becoming a major difficulty, with boats pitching up on
                    the beaches of Florida, hundreds of people drowning, and all of that.</p>
                <p>I discovered that the Bahamian Government really wasn't being terribly helpful in
                    these areas. And because of the “narcotics traffickers,” American citizens were
                    running into trouble. We had the case of a legislator from the State of Michigan
                    who mysteriously disappeared from his sailboat. Everybody on board was
                    apparently murdered. The boat was found, floating empty. The belief was that
                    they'd run into some drug traffickers who killed them. It was becoming very
                    troubling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an inherent kind of anti-Americanism or was it
                        because of these other interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There were two parts to the problem. First, I arrived in Nassau in
                    July, 1981. The Ambassador appointed under the Carter administration had left on
                    January 20, 1981, and he hadn't been replaced. The Pindling government was
                    getting the distinct feeling that the new, Republican administration was “less
                    friendly.” It was very much a “black-white” thing. You have to understand that
                    there is a very definite relationship between the American civil rights
                    movement, particularly as Black Americans see it, and the efforts of the
                    Bahamians to obtain independence. Pindling, in fact, had defeated a white
                    minority government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pindling is...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Lyndon Oscar Pindling, known among his supporters as “LOP,” or “Ping”,
                    was the Prime Minister of the Bahamas. He had taken power, initially, under the
                    self-government program in 1966. The British couldn't wait to give the Bahamas
                    its independence. The country became independent in 1973, and he became Prime
                    Minister, since his party, the PLP [Progressive Liberal Party], was pushing a
                    black agenda or black accusations against a white, minority government. There
                    was a close connection with the American civil rights movement. Many leaders of
                    the American civil rights movement used to come to the Bahamas. It wasn't by
                    chance that the Congressman from Harlem, Adam Clayton Powell, used to “hang out”
                    on Bimini Island, the westernmost island in the Bahamas Archipelago—50 miles due
                    East of Miami.</p>
                <p>There was a distinct feeling that the Republicans were “anti-black,” and
                    certainly anti-Pindling. After all, it was during the Nixon administration that
                    Pindling had refused to surrender Robert Vesco, when we had asked for Vesco's
                    extradition because of the stock fraud in which he was involved. It was very
                    clear to all observers that the Pindling administration had taken a political
                    decision not to let Vesco go. The Pindling administration was probably not far
                    off the mark in thinking that the Republicans didn't admire them. The fact that
                    there was no American Ambassador at post for six months was viewed with a
                    certain concern on the part of Pindling.</p>
                <p>I remember my first call on Pindling. It took place around the first week in
                    July, 1981, when I went to see him with my predecessor. I had gone down a little
                    early, just after I completed my year at the National War College, to take a
                    look at the post. My predecessor and I had an “overlap” of several weeks.</p>
                <p>This call on Pindling coincided with the decision to hold a seven-nation meeting
                    in Nassau of Foreign Ministers of the countries covered by the “Caribbean Basin
                    Initiative” proposed by President Reagan. Alexander Haig, the new Secretary of
                    State, was going to attend the meeting, at which he was going to present the
                    “Caribbean Basin Initiative” or “CBI”. Since the Secretary of State was going to
                    visit the Bahamas, prudence dictated that I should be on hand, no matter how
                    many eggs were broken in the process.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>As it turned out, the Reagan administration couldn't have cared less about the
                    Bahamas. They just happened to use Nassau as a location for launching the
                    “Initiative.” There wasn't even going to be provision for the Secretary of State
                    to meet Pindling. We proposed to use their conference hall for three days, as it
                    were, and didn't even plan for the Secretary of State to call on the Prime
                    Minister. I made a distinct effort, using some of my contacts in the Executive
                    Secretariat at the State Department, to make sure that time was found in the
                    Secretary's schedule to meet Pindling. I figured that Pindling would feel a bit
                    sore at us, and slighted, if Haig didn't call on him. I know that I would have
                    felt slighted if I had been in Pindling's shoes. So they managed to cut 30
                    minutes off Al Haig's tennis game to give him some time to see the Prime
                    Minister of the Bahamas. I thought how clever I had been to manage to handle
                    this little problem!</p>
                <p>When I went to pay a courtesy call on Prime Minister Pindling with my
                    predecessor, I was absolutely stunned when Pindling wore an Hawaiian-flowered
                    shirt (People were very relaxed in the Bahamas.). I showed up in my dark suit!
                    After the niceties had been completed, he leaned back and said, “I wonder what
                    kind of trouble I can cause you—to get your government's attention.” I gulped. I
                    wondered what this man was talking about. Then he launched into a litany of
                    complaints of how the United States had “slighted” the Bahamas and hadn't been
                    very friendly. (He particularly mentioned that the United States hadn't
                    appointed an Ambassador.) One of the things that the Bahamian Government was
                    really sore about was that the Internal Revenue Service had decided in 1980 to
                    refuse to allow deductions for American organizations and groups holding
                    conventions outside the United States. In other words, if you were a
                    professional person and went to a convention overseas, you used to be able to
                    “write off” the costs...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the Northern Virginia Lawyers Association
                        meeting in Athens, when I served there. I wondered what this was all
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That's right. Of course, that really stopped the conventions and hurt
                    tourism in the Bahamas. They were sore as all get out about that. At this
                    initial meeting, Pindling mentioned all sorts of other, real and imagined
                    slights. I remember saying to him (I was sort of “leaning forward in the
                    foxhole.”), “Prime Minister, tell me what's bothering you, and maybe we can put
                    the systems together, because I may know how to push the buttons.” I didn't
                    mention that I'd gotten him an appointment with Al Haig or anything like that. I
                    was trying to give him a message, “Look, I don't have anything against anybody.
                    It's important to me that I do well in this job.” I guess I was setting myself
                    up for a good case of “clientitis,” but that's the kind of thing I had to do. If
                    you're going to be in charge of a Foreign Service post, you need to work with
                    the local government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The whole idea is to take care of some of the
                        problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Anticipate the problems and take care of them, because that's what
                    you're there for. The folks back home really don't understand what the situation
                    is. Your position is like the flea in the elephant corral. Pindling huffed and
                    puffed at that point, but his remark was kind of a “shot across my bow.” I began
                    to appreciate that we had some problems in the Bahamas that I didn't know
                    about.</p>
                <p>After the first few months in Nassau, it became apparent to me, based on the
                    intelligence that I was receiving from the desk and my friends in the Bureau of
                    American Republic Affairs, that there was not going to be an Ambassador
                    appointed for a long time, given the way the matter had been handled. Several
                    candidates had been put up. One of the initial problems with the Reagan
                    administration was that a number of appointees couldn't get clearance from the
                    SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission]. This candidate for the position of
                    Ambassador to the Bahamas had problems with his financial background. So I
                    realized that I was probably going to be on my own for quite a long time.</p>
                <p>Now, I should mention at this point that I didn't have all that many friends in
                    the ARA Bureau. I had never served in ARA before and was not a Spanish speaker.
                    I really didn't belong to that particular group in the Department. However, the
                    Executive Director of the Bureau at that point was a friend, and Assistant
                    Secretary Tom Enders had been my boss in Phnom Penh. I had a couple of other
                    “friends at court.” The desk officer was a bright young man, a Naval Academy
                    graduate, intelligent and energetic.</p>
                <p>Under the circumstances, I had a personal decision to make about how I was going
                    to proceed, as a Foreign Service Officer. I had two choices. First, I could “sit
                    on my hands,” keep the lid on in the Embassy, manage the office, but avoid doing
                    anything liable to get me into trouble. On the other hand, I thought that I
                    might never again be given a chance to manage anything, because that's the
                    nature of the Foreign Service. I might as well try to do something in the
                    Bahamas. I'm the guy in charge. I'm “Mr. United States” in Nassau. It's quite
                    evident that we've got some problems here. There are American interests at
                    stake, so why not? What can happen except that I can fall on my face? So I
                    decided that I was going to be an “activist” charg� d'affaires.</p>
                <p>The only instruction I had been given by Tom Enders, the Assistant Secretary for
                    American Republic Affairs, was, “Look, you're going to get a 'political'
                    Ambassador. I want you to be a 'strong' DCM. Go down there and lead that place.”
                    That is the only instruction that I had. It was kind of a revelation to
                    discover, when you're a professional Foreign Service Officer, how it is when
                    you're sent out and put in charge of an Embassy. Being in charge of a
                    constituent post is entirely different. In the case of managing an Embassy,
                    you're the man. It doesn't matter what the size of the Embassy is. The paper
                    work is the same. The basic issue is how much attention the “front office” [the
                    Bureau] is going to pay to you. Are you in a place that's going to get people's
                    attention, or what?</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>While I wasn't exactly going to go out and look for trouble, I soon discovered
                    that in the Foreign Service you don't have to do anything to get into trouble.
                    Just the fact that you're there means that lightning may strike, because you've
                    become the lightning rod.</p>
                <p>That was very instructive. I found that during the first six months at post some
                    of the issues which came up were very intense. I developed a lot of mental and
                    physical stress, given the problem that I had with the Foreign Minister—the
                    Prime Minister, less so. The stress was so great that my back “went out.” I
                    developed a back problem. It reminded me so much of the problem that Mike Rives
                    had 10 years before in Phnom Penh. He had the same problem with his back. He was
                    under so much stress, being “under the gun,” regarding this policy in Cambodia,
                    that his back “went out.” The Assistant Secretary told Mike Rives not to leave
                    the post for treatment, because there was no one suitable to be put in
                    charge.</p>
                <p>I faced the same kind of problem. Fortunately, my next door neighbor at the East
                    End of the island, where I lived, was a British doctor. He gave me some muscle
                    relaxants. I became so relaxed that my eyeballs almost fell out! I felt that I
                    could only work standing up. I couldn't sit down. I read my telegrams standing
                    up. I arranged a desk where I could work standing up. The stress was enormous.
                    That was a very intense experience for me, from that point of view.</p>
                <p>By the time I wrote this 90 day review of the situation to the Department, I had
                    an American citizen come to me, at the Embassy. He owned property on an island
                    about 35 miles West of New Providence Island, where Nassau is located. The name
                    of this island is Norman's Cay (Key). It was a privately owned island with a
                    marina and an airstrip on it. It had been developed over the years. A number of
                    the properties on it were owned by American and Canadian people who came down
                    there for the winter. It had a very nice [scuba] “dive” location, fishing was
                    good, and it was relatively close to Nassau. This fellow owned three or four
                    bungalows on the island. He had developed it so that they were right off the
                    runway of the airstrip. People could rent the bungalows and fly in. They could
                    actually park their airplanes right next to the bungalows. He came in to
                    complain to me that Colombian drug traffickers had moved in and, in effect,
                    taken over the island. They were intimidating the owners of property down there,
                    so much so that he really didn't have access to his property. His complaints to
                    the Bahamian government hadn't resulted in any action.</p>
                <p>It turned out that a year or two before that [1979 or 1980] the Bahamian police
                    had raided the island but had been unsuccessful in arresting the Colombians, who
                    had managed to escape or “paid people off.” No large amounts of drugs were
                    found. I took this complaint under advisement.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Then I made my initial trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Turks and Caicos
                    Islands are still a British colony. Under the arrangement we had with the
                    Department the DCM in Nassau is accredited to the Governor and Government of the
                    Turks and Caicos Islands, because we have an Ambassador in London. So the
                    Ambassador in Nassau is not accredited to the Turks and Caicos Islands—the DCM
                    is. So, since it was part of my “turf,” I decided to go down there and take a
                    look at this place. It was a three-day jaunt to get there—there was no direct
                    way. I went over to Grand Bahama Island and took the U. S. Air Force courier
                    aircraft, which used to make the run down to the various tracking stations. They
                    took me down to the Turks and Caicos Islands. However, to get back, I had to
                    take an Air Florida flight back to Miami and then from Miami back to Nassau. I
                    made that trip and met the Governor, the people in the Turks and Caicos Islands,
                    and looked around the place.</p>
                <p>I flew back to Miami and was met at Miami International airport at planeside by a
                    Drug Enforcement Administration agent, who took me into Miami to a hotel. He sat
                    me down and talked to me all night about the problems they had on Norman's Cay
                    with the Colombian cartel, which had taken over the island. What, in fact, the
                    DEA wanted to do in the Bahamas, was to raid the island to apprehend the
                    Colombians “in the act,” as it were, because large quantities of cocaine were
                    being transshipped there. This was the beginning of the major transshipment of
                    cocaine into Florida. This was in 1980-1981.</p>
                <p>I was a bit taken aback by what he was proposing because this would have involved
                    taking American helicopters and DEA agents, with Bahamian police, and landing in
                    what would be a “hot LZ” [coming down in a landing zone defended by hostile
                    elements], and possibly “shooting it out” with the Colombians. I said, “I think
                    this is not allowed under the Mansfield Amendment.” The Mansfield Amendment
                    doesn't permit American law enforcement agencies to do this kind of thing.
                    However, I said that I was very sympathetic with what he was telling me, given
                    what I was beginning to learn about the nature of the problem on Norman's Cay. I
                    said that I wasn't sure that the Bahamian government would “buy” this, given
                    their attitudes about law enforcement cooperation with the United States. On the
                    other hand, I wasn't sure that the United States government would want to do
                    this.</p>
                <p>However, I said that I would “check it out.” I said that this wasn't something
                    that I would really want to write up in a cable and send up to the State
                    Department, because I thought that it would be immediately shot full of holes if
                    I did that. I said that what I would like to do is to take the first opportunity
                    to talk to Assistant Secretary of State Tom Enders, face to face, and see if I
                    could get his verbal approval.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>I knew that Enders would be coming down to Miami in early December, 1981. At the
                    time the Rockefeller Foundation had what they called the Caribbean-Central
                    American Committee. The committee met annually in Miami, and chiefs of state
                    from Central American and Caribbean countries attended to talk about issues of
                    mutual interest. Since this was the first year of the Caribbean Basin
                    Initiative, I felt sure that the Assistant Secretary would be there, and I would
                    get a chance to talk to him. The DEA agent agreed with that and left it to me to
                    proceed. I did meet Enders very briefly when he came to Miami for this meeting.
                    I didn't really have time to discuss the matter. That's another thing that you
                    discover when you're trying to get the attention of your boss, when you're
                    charg� d'affaires. Sometimes it's a major problem to have the chance to talk to
                    your man in the front office of the bureau, unless he happens to come through
                    your area on a visit. This reminded me of my experience years before in Douala,
                    Cameroon, which I mentioned previously, when Assistant Secretary of State G.
                    Mennen (”Soapy”) Williams came through Douala one morning, en route home from
                    the Congo. I only learned about it when the UTA (French Airlines) representative
                    called me.</p>
                <p>Tom Enders asked me, when I met him at a cocktail party, “Are you having fun?” I
                    said, “Yes, it's great. Can I talk to you?” He was distracted by someone, and I
                    never did get a chance to talk to him.</p>
                <p>However, I did meet another person, John Upston, a political appointee in ARA
                    [the Bureau of American Republic Affairs] who had the title of “Caribbean
                    Coordinator”, a Deputy Assistant Secretary level position. He apparently had a
                    lot of experience in the Caribbean area and had worked in the State Department,
                    off and on, over the years. We struck up a friendship. The chemistry between us
                    was good. He was very interested in what I had to say about what I was seeing in
                    the Bahamas. We were able to set up a dialogue, both by phone and when he came
                    down and visited us on several occasions. He was very sympathetic about what I
                    was trying to do. It turned out that he and I—and I'll get into this later in
                    the story—managed to get past the bureaucracy in getting permission to do
                    something effective in the drug war in the Bahamas.</p>
                <p>I had discovered by that point that we had an American Embassy but had no
                    resources with which to fight crime or even to get an appreciation of how big a
                    problem it was. I would get, for example, a message from the U. S. Coast Guard,
                    saying, “We understand that Robert Vesco's yacht is in the marina at Nassau. Can
                    you check it out and see if he's there? You can very easily tell which boat is
                    his because there will be a grand piano on the fantail.” Well, how in hell am I
                    supposed to do that from an Embassy automobile? This was the only vehicle I had
                    to get around in. Here I was, the charg� d'affaires in an archipelago. If I
                    needed a boat, I had to go out and rent one. It was a little hard to find yachts
                    of escaped financiers if all you had was a car.</p>
                <p>Then we began to appreciate the fact that, when you have problems like the one at
                    Norman's Cay, how do you go down and find out what the situation is there? How
                    do you fly in? I didn't have any travel money for this. I didn't have an
                    airplane.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>I finally managed to get down to Norman's Cay because the FAA [Federal Aviation
                    Administration] would fly in from Florida from time to time to do what they
                    called “ramp checks.” The FAA would fly into an airport and just check the
                    registration numbers on the aircraft there. They checked on U. S. registered
                    aircraft parked at airports in the Bahamas. You could tell very easily which
                    ones were being used for “drug hauls”—they didn't have seats in them or might
                    have rubber fuel bladders in the back instead of seats. What the drug
                    traffickers would do was use all manner of aircraft, initially flying in
                    marijuana and then, of course, transporting large amounts of cocaine.</p>
                <p>Yachts were coming through all the time. The Bahamas is a major tourist cruising
                    area. From time to time people would tell me stories about drug trafficking. A
                    cabin cruiser or something like that might observe a DC-3 transport aircraft
                    dump out hundreds of bales of marijuana. The traffickers used to wrap the
                    marijuana in garbage bags in 40 and 80 pound quantities. The bags would be water
                    tight and would float only about an inch or so above the surface of the ocean.
                    The bags were green and hard to see. One person told me that he was on his boat,
                    sailing toward Nassau. He saw a DC-3 circling a nearby area and pushing out
                    bales of marijuana. The crew then “pancaked” the aircraft in the water, stepped
                    out on the wing, were picked up by motorboats, which then picked up the
                    marijuana and let the plane sink. He said, if that happened, you really didn't
                    want to be there. Three things might happen, if you came across this stuff
                    floating in the ocean. First, the “dopers” [marijuana smugglers] could catch
                    you, and you'd be in trouble. Secondly, the American Coast Guard could catch
                    you. Thirdly, the Bahamian Coast Guard could catch you. Any way, you'd be in
                    trouble. So this could become a very serious citizen protection problem. I
                    recall that in 1982 we had one major case like that.</p>
                <p>We were beginning to discover that large amounts of narcotics were flowing
                    through the Bahamas, and the Bahamian Government wasn't very helpful in solving
                    the problem. When you would confront them with this, their basic reaction was,
                    “Look, you can't stop this traffic with all your armed forces and law
                    enforcement resources. How do you expect us, with our tiny little Coast Guard,
                    and only one air traffic control tower in the whole archipelago, to control this
                    sort of thing?” They were right of course. The problem was that they were not
                    going to allow us to come in and do it for them.</p>
                <p>So, I found that I had a problem getting around the country. How could I get an
                    appreciation of this problem if I couldn't even get to the places where this
                    sort of thing was happening?</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>To go back to the Norman's Cay story, I hitched a ride with the FAA guy on one
                    occasion. I asked him if he would fly me down to Norman's Cay, because I wanted
                    to see what was going on there. In the late fall of 1981 two things had
                    happened. First, I had received the formal complaint from the man who owned
                    bungalows down there. In effect, he had been “run off” his property by the
                    Colombians. Secondly, I was informed by the Bahamas desk in the Office of
                    Caribbean Affairs in the State Department that a number of American citizen
                    property owners on Norman's Cay were going to take out a full-page ad in 10
                    international newspapers, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the
                    Los Angeles Times, and the Times of London, complaining about the government of
                    the Bahamas doing nothing about this problem at Norman's Cay. They had been
                    forced off their property.</p>
                <p>I told the desk, “Look, please contact these people, whoever they are—I don't
                    know who they are—and ask them to hold off and at least give me a chance to
                    raise the matter with the government of the Bahamas.” My instinct was that if
                    the ads were published, there was going to be “egg on my face,” because I was
                    the local “whipping boy.” I wanted to say to the government of the Bahamas,
                    “This is the problem. What are you doing about it?”</p>
                <p>I wasn't having much luck with the Foreign Minister/Attorney General in talking
                    about the base agreements. The retiring Commandant of the Coast Guard came
                    through the Bahamas on a trip to various locations to bid farewell to the local
                    authorities. I took him on an official call on the Foreign Minister. The Foreign
                    Minister really gave us a hard time. He really lectured this four-star, U. S.
                    Coast Guard admiral about what he called the “fecklessness” of American law
                    enforcement efforts. He even made some adverse comments about the quality of
                    American youth joining the armed services. I could see that the admiral was
                    really doing a “slow burn.” We were both pretty angry by the time we left that
                    interview, with the gratuitous insults of the United States made by the Bahamian
                    Foreign Minister.</p>
                <p>Then we were driven to call on the Governor General, whose name was Sir Gerald
                    Cash, or “Gerry Cash” to his friends. He was a wonderful man—the epitome of the
                    friendly Bahamanian that most Americans associate with the islands in the old
                    days. A call on him was always the last call we made with a visitor. He was sort
                    of an antidote to all of the bashing we had had. He would bring our blood
                    pressure down about ten degrees because he was so decent. I remember that in the
                    car for the short drive over to Government House, I said, “Admiral, you look
                    pretty 'ticked off' over what the Foreign Minister was saying.” He said, “Yeah,
                    you kind of looked as if you were ready to go over the table with this guy,
                    too.” I said, “That was a pretty incredible display of arrogance,” which, of
                    course, I dutifully reported to the Department. I would bring in high-level
                    visitors when I called on senior Bahamian officials. They would always agree
                    with my request that they make such calls. I was becoming more and more
                    conscious of the fact that these Bahamian officials were sore that there was no
                    resident American Ambassador and that they were being slighted. At least, if I
                    brought in “heavy hitters” [senior officials] from Washington...</p>

                    would be lined up to go to a “soft touch” place like Nassau. But, generally
                    speaking, it was true that people interested in serving as Ambassador to the
                    Bahamas had problems getting clearances from the SEC [Securities and Exchange
                    Commission].</p>

                    Again, this was a misapprehension because there were definite American interests
                    in the Bahamas that would have been helped enormously by some competence.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, in the midst of the problems I was having with the Foreign Ministry, my
                    wife and I were invited to dinner by the Board of Directors of the Morton Salt
                    Company of Chicago. Morton Salt had a major salt operation down on Great Inagua
                    Island in the Bahamas. This is the place—as you may have seen in the press—where
                    the Marines were practicing their landings for the operation in Haiti. Great
                    Inagua Island is very close to Haiti. Its only redeeming feature is that it has
                    nothing on it except salt. There are enormous salt pans [where seawater is
                    evaporated by the sun, leaving the salt]. Morton Salt has an industrial salt
                    operation there. The Board of Morton Salt would come to the Bahamas every year
                    for their annual meeting at a club on the Western end of New Providence
                    Island.</p>
                <p>Anyway we were invited. The Bahamian Prime Minister was there. Everybody who was
                    anybody was there. Again, that was a revelation to me because as I sat there,
                    the chairman of the Board of Morton Salt stood up and proposed a toast to the
                    Queen, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, and the Prime Minister of the Bahamas.
                    We sat down and waited for the Prime Minister to reciprocate and offer a toast
                    to the United States. The Prime Minister sat still. He didn't get up or toast
                    the President of the United States. I really almost “lost it” at that point. I
                    almost took my wife by the arm and said, “We're getting out of here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>I wondered to myself, “What should I do? This guy has just insulted the United
                    States.” It was very clear what protocol required at this point. Anyway, I
                    decided not to make a fuss. I decided to corner the little bastard and I would
                    “put it to him.” His game was that his flunkies would surround him at the end of
                    the evening. He would rush out of the room, and nobody would get a chance to
                    talk to him. But I cornered Prime Minister Pindling before he could get out of
                    the room and I said, “I need to talk to you.” He said, “OK, give me a call and
                    come over and see me.” I must say that Pindling was very good about that. He
                    would always take my telephone calls, and I could see him when I asked, unlike
                    the Foreign Minister. If I needed to see the Foreign Minister about anything, it
                    would take as long as two weeks to set it up. There were only three career
                    diplomatic chiefs of mission in Nassau: the American, the British, and the
                    Haitian. You could have a meeting of the Diplomatic Corps in a telephone booth,
                    yet it would take two weeks to arrange to see the Foreign Minister. It was
                    rather frustrating, to say the least.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I went over and called on Prime Minister Pindling. I said, “Look, I have
                    a couple of things to raise with you. First, I'm getting complaints from
                    American citizens who own property down in Norman's Cay that they're being
                    'pushed around' by Colombian drug smugglers. They want to put a full-page ad in
                    the international press. I've asked them not to do this until I could make
                    representations to the government.” At this point he said, “Who are these people
                    who are going to put a full-page ad in the papers and what are their names?” I
                    said, “I don't really know who they are. I got this information from the State
                    Department.” He said, “That's all right. I'll find out who they are from the
                    Land Register.”</p>
                <p>I thought, “Boy, I'm not about to say who these folks are.” I knew a couple of
                    them. One of them was a Vice President of Salomon Brothers Corporation who
                    happened to be a close friend of Assistant Secretary of State Tom Enders.
                    Another one was the fellow who had come into my office to complain to me. He was
                    from Florida.</p>
                <p>So I said, “Shall we talk about Norman's Cay?” He said, “I don't know anything
                    about Norman's Cay. As far as I know, the police are doing their normal duty.” I
                    said, “Well, there is a problem down there.”</p>
                <p>Then I said, “Look, the other issue is the base agreements. We need to sign the
                    base agreements so that you can start getting the rent checks.” I said, “I can't
                    get any answer out of your Foreign Minister.” He said, “What? My understanding
                    is that you [the United States] are the problem.” I said, “No, we're not the
                    problem. We're ready to sign. You just tell us where and when you want to sign,
                    and you'll start getting your money.” It was clear from the expression on his
                    face that this was news to him. He said, “Well, I'll check into that.” I went
                    home, feeling rather self satisfied. I had done an “end run” around the Foreign
                    Minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you mention the lack of a toast?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No. I decided that, since I didn't walk out on him, I wouldn't do that.
                    I'll mention another story that happened a year later.</p>
                <p>This is a lesson to future diplomats on how you handle situations like this:
                    should you take umbrage and what should you do—particularly if you are not the
                    Ambassador? There is a difference between being a charg� d'affaires and being
                    the Ambassador. Your “clout” is entirely different. You have to be careful not
                    to “shoot yourself in the foot.”</p>
                <p>I was angry. I felt slighted on behalf of the United States. I felt that we, as a
                    people, were being slighted. I felt satisfied at having raised these matters
                    with the Prime Minister. Within a matter of days I received a diplomatic note
                    from the Foreign Ministry, saying that, in fact, they were ready to sign the
                    base agreement. So I dutifully sent the text of the diplomatic note to the
                    Department. I really didn't understand it—a lot of it was legalese gobbledygook.
                    I hadn't steeped myself in the text of this agreement because I'd been assured
                    by the people in Legal Affairs in the State Department and the desk that we had
                    an agreement.</p>
                <p>Patting myself on the back, I dutifully sent over the text of this agreement and
                    informed the State Department that we were close to signature. I felt, “What's
                    so hard about this diplomacy stuff?” I was solving problems left, right, and
                    center. Well, “boom !!!”. I got a message back from the Department which said,
                    in effect, “The Bahamian Government is 'sand bagging' us. They want to change
                    the text of the agreement. They want guarantees about their $100 million that,
                    over a period of 10 years, or whatever the time period was, they are going to be
                    guaranteed $10 million a year. We can't do that for American domestic legal
                    reasons.” So we found ourselves back at square one. But at least I had an
                    official piece of paper out of the Bahamian government, which I put in front of
                    our Bahamas desk.</p>
                <p>Another interesting thing happened at this time. It shows the trials and
                    tribulations of trying to run a Foreign Service post. As I mentioned, the
                    Bahamian desk officer, whose name escapes me at the moment, was really an
                    excellent young man. Suddenly, he disappeared from sight. He was no longer in
                    the State Department. For a couple of days I couldn't find out where he had
                    gone. I had really depended on this man for intelligence, getting things done,
                    and all of that. To their great embarrassment, the Department admitted to the
                    fact that my desk officer had just been arrested by the Arlington County,
                    Virginia Police for “pimping” for his wife! His wife was an Uruguayan national
                    and apparently was prostituting herself. And they arrested him for pimping for
                    her. I thought, “Oh, God, I can't believe that this is happening to me! It's
                    just incredible!” My best friend at court at the State Department had just been
                    arrested and bounced out of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This shows that you really have to pay Foreign Service
                        Officers a higher salary, I guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I just couldn't believe it. This bright, young guy. It was incredible.
                    So there was no desk officer. In fact, the Department assigned a young woman who
                    was a consular officer as Bahamas desk officer. She happened to be the wife of a
                    man in AID with whom I had worked in Cambodia. So I more or less knew them. But
                    she really wasn't terribly competent at that point. She didn't know how to be a
                    desk officer. A desk officer has to know how to “push buttons” and get things
                    done, aside from knowing the substance of the issues. Obviously, she wasn't just
                    dealing with one country. She had a whole sheaf of Caribbean countries to deal
                    with. I needed someone who knew what he was doing up there—for my own self
                    protection. And I'll describe what that meant.</p>
                <p>We're now getting toward the end of December, [1981]. I'd already had my little
                    experience with the conference in Miami. I didn't get much help from Tom Enders,
                    the Assistant Secretary, in terms of mounting a formal presentation to the
                    Government of the Bahamas to do something on the law enforcement side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly on Norman's Cay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Norman's Cay was a particular problem. It was quite evident that we
                    needed to do something. We had problems in the Bahamas, and the United States
                    Government really didn't know anything about them. Law enforcement was becoming
                    a major difficulty in our relations with the Bahamas. We in the U. S. Embassy
                    were not equipped to do much of anything about it. We didn't have the manpower
                    and we didn't have the access to the means, except from time to time when a U.
                    S. Coast Guard cutter would come into port. For example, I had learned that the
                    Haitians were using the Bahamas as a kind of “moving walkway” through to
                    Miami.</p>
                <p>Among other visitors we had in Nassau was the Deputy Commissioner of the U. S.
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service, Al Nelson, a political appointee. He
                    later became Commissioner of the INS. I was informed in advance that he was
                    coming down for a short vacation.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>As was my practice, when a VIP [Very Important Person] came to town, I'd go out
                    to the airport, meet him, and escort him to his hotel. I figured that they
                    didn't particularly want to be met. However, we had one Senator and member of
                    the Foreign Relations Committee who came to town. He was a Democratic Senator
                    from Nebraska and had been Mayor of Omaha. He has since died of a heart attack.
                    He came down for a tennis weekend or something like that. I met him at the
                    airport. He said, “You didn't have to come out and meet me. I didn't
                    particularly want to be met.” I said, “Sir, when a member of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee comes to Nassau, you're going to be met.” I drove by the
                    Embassy and the Residence and that sort of thing. I said, “This is just for your
                    general education. By the way, why don't you people do your job as far as
                    appointing decent Ambassadors is concerned? Why do you let the administration
                    get away with appointing 'losers' to a place like this?” His answer was that it
                    was not worth it to most Senators to fight a President on those kind of
                    appointments unless the nominee was really a world class loser. Anyhow, we had a
                    nice chat and became very friendly. He'd invite me to lunch when I'd come to
                    Washington. It was my practice to meet people like that, because it's one of the
                    little things that you can do when you're the boss.</p>
                <p>The previous Carter Administration Ambassador to the Bahamas came to town from
                    time. This guy had not been particularly active. Ambassador Charley Whitehouse
                    once said about the Foreign Minister or the Finance Minister of Thailand, “I had
                    to hold a mirror to his mouth to make sure that he was still breathing.” The
                    previous ambassador was something like that. When the previous Ambassador would
                    come to Nassau, I would send the car out for him, as a courtesy. I figured that
                    it didn't take much of an effort to show a little bit of consideration. I'd
                    never forgotten the lesson I'd been told about Richard Nixon after he had been
                    Vice President. He was traveling around the world on behalf of Pepsi-Cola.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd been defeated in the election for Governor of
                        California [1962]. He was considered a “loser.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Absolutely a “loser.” He was working for Pepsi-Cola and was traveling
                    constantly. The story I've been told is that he was not particularly
                    well-treated by the Foreign Service. He'd come to a given capital, and the
                    Ambassador and everybody else would “cut him dead.” Except Marshall Green, when
                    he was Ambassador to Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Henry Tasca.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Right. They took care of former Vice President Nixon. As a consequence,
                    when he was elected President in [1968], these guys were taken care of. That
                    lesson was not wasted on me. As a matter of courtesy, it doesn't take much
                    effort. I wasn't all that busy, so why not go out and meet these people?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's return to finish the Norman Cay matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: All of these things are kind of intertwined. It's very hard to separate
                    them from each other, because, as they developed, my experience in the job also
                    came into play. You kind of have to “rock back and forth,” from issue to issue.
                    I'm covering these matters chronologically, because that's how I can best
                    remember them.</p>
                <p>In January, 1982, there was still no Ambassador in sight. No Ambassador was going
                    to be around for a long time. We had a problem with the base agreements, which
                    were “hanging fire.” There was a growing appreciation that there was a crime
                    problem in the Bahamas, which largely came down to a law enforcement issue.
                    However, the Embassy was really not equipped to do anything about it. American
                    interests and American citizens were being hurt by this attitude [on the part of
                    the Bahamian authorities]. The Bahamas were not really a safe place to visit,
                    yet we had something like two million Americans visiting this place every year.
                    However, even if I had wanted to, I could not ignore the problem of law
                    enforcement in the Bahamas, if I were going to do my job. I decided that, by
                    guess or by God, I was going to try to do something.</p>
                <p>As I understood the problem and given the experience I had had to date, you have
                    to convince the “front office” of the Bureau of American Republic Affairs to
                    help you. How could I do that? One, by trying to get more people assigned to the
                    Embassy. Give the “front office” an appreciation of the problem and then see
                    what could happen.</p>
                <p>In early February, 1982, I received a phone call from someone who said that Prime
                    Minister Pindling was going to Washington to attend the Congressional Prayer
                    Breakfast. He said, “I just wanted to let you know that.”</p>
                <p>I had already had the experience in October, 1981 of the Foreign Minister going
                    to New York for the opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations and
                    not telling the Embassy that he was going. It had been my experience that
                    whenever a Foreign Minister would go to New York for the UNGA, the American
                    Embassy would be told. I was a little put out about that. Not only did he fail
                    to tell me that he was going to New York, but I read about his speech at the
                    United Nations in the newspapers. I wasn't even “clued in,” so I was a little
                    bit annoyed about this. I found it rather strange that the Bahamian Government
                    took this view that cabinet ministers could “swan off” officially and
                    unofficially to the United States and not tell anybody [in the Embassy in
                    Nassau].</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>So I called Prime Minister Pindling on the phone. I had learned that he would
                    take telephone calls without too much difficulty. He wasn't all that much
                    concerned about protocol. I said that I had heard that he was going to
                    Washington for a visit. I said, “Anything I can do to help you?” He replied,
                    “Well, I have some “buddies” who got me invited to the Congressional Prayer
                    Breakfast. Why do you people treat the Bahamas this way,” alluding to the fact
                    that we had no resident Ambassador and why we treated them in a slighting
                    manner. I said, “Listen, while you're up there, if you agree, I'd like to try to
                    make some appointments for you to see some people and get to know the new team
                    [i. e., in the Reagan administration].” The Reagan administration had been in
                    power for a year at that point. Aside from meeting Secretary of State Haig, he
                    really hadn't met anybody else in the U. S. Government, to my knowledge.</p>
                <p>Pindling said, “No, I don't think so.” I said, “I don't know where Secretary of
                    State Haig is.” I think that at that time he was probably “shuttling” somewhere,
                    perhaps in the Middle East. I don't think that the Falklands Islands crisis had
                    yet started. I said that I didn't know where the Secretary of State was.
                    However, I said, “The Deputy Secretary is in Washington, and he would be
                    delighted to meet you if he knew that you were in town.” Pindling said, “No,
                    no,” sort of dismissing this idea out of hand. However, I went ahead and, using
                    my contacts in ARA, managed to get an appointment for Pindling with Secretary of
                    State Haig, who, it turned out, was to be in Washington during the period when
                    Prime Minister Pindling was going to be there. It was harder to get the $200 in
                    travel funds for me to go to Washington to be there for the appointment. My
                    instinct told me that I had better be there.</p>
                <p>Normally, when a chief of state or chief of government goes to Washington, the
                    American Ambassador or Chief of Mission is also there as a courtesy. There would
                    be no problem arranging that. However, a charg� d'affaires is in a different
                    position. I told the Department, “Look, I think that I ought to be there.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly with a “prickly” guy like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. Anyway, I managed to convince ARA to come up with the $200 for
                    a round trip ticket, Nassau-Washington. I went up to Washington in the same
                    plane with Prime Minister Pindling. It was the coldest month in 100 years. It
                    was the week that the Air Florida plane crashed in the Potomac River.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It hit the 14th St. Bridge or almost did.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: That was when we were in these meetings. I arrived Sunday night in
                    Washington and stayed with my friend Upston, who was the Caribbean
                    Coordinator—not that I couldn't afford a hotel, but he invited me to stay with
                    him in Bethesda. I drove into Washington with him and went to the State
                    Department on Monday morning. The appointment was scheduled for Tuesday. I went
                    to the Office of Caribbean Affairs to make sure that the talking points were
                    prepared for the Secretary. I dressed rather casually. I had on a tweed jacket
                    and slacks. I figured to wear my more formal suit for the meeting the next day.
                    The new Bahamas desk officer didn't know anything and hadn't prepared anything.
                    So I had to sit down and prepare talking points for the Secretary.</p>
                <p>We got a call from the Secretary's office. His assistant said, “The Secretary has
                    a conflict in his schedule. He has to go to the White House on Tuesday. Bring
                    your man in around today at 5:00 PM.” I said, “What!!” Then, I thought, first, I
                    have to find Prime Minister Pindling and make sure that he will come. I called
                    the Bahamian Embassy, and they agreed to bring him to the State Department at
                    5:00 PM. Of course, I wasn't wearing my regular “burying and marrying” suit. I
                    was going to be meeting with the Secretary of State in a tweed jacket!</p>
                <p>I have never forgotten my first boss in the Foreign Service, in the Office of
                    International Conferences, who was an old-line Foreign Service Political
                    Officer. He was a great guy—an FSO-2 at that point, a very senior officer who
                    had just come out of the Congo. I remember that in my first efficiency report he
                    wrote, “Mr. Antippas sometimes comes to the office dressed in a sport coat.”
                    [Laughter] That was the Foreign Service as it used to be—not exactly “stiff
                    upper lip,” but there was a dress code. I thought, “There's no way I can get
                    home to Upston's house to change my clothes. I'm going to be involved flat out
                    to the last minute, getting these talking points processed through the
                    system.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, we went up to meet with Secretary Haig at 5:00 PM. Haig was very affable.
                    I don't know whether he remembered me or not, but I think that he recognized me
                    from my Cambodian days. So Pindling, Tom Enders, this guy Upston, and I were
                    there for the meeting with Secretary Haig. Pindling started “taking off” after
                    the United States, with his litany of complaints about this, that, and the other
                    thing. He was particularly angry with the Embassy.</p>
                <p>The political season in the Bahamas was already starting. Parliamentary Elections
                    were coming up in June, 1982. My Political Officer, who acted as my deputy, and
                    I had agreed that I would go to the governing party political convention. He
                    would cover the opposition political party convention. We knew them all, but I
                    said, “We'll be even handed.”</p>
                <p>I was watching the opposition political party convention on TV, at home, with a
                    friend of mine visiting from Washington, who was a staffer on the Foreign
                    Affairs Committee of the U. S. House of Representatives. I had invited him to
                    stay with us. The opposition political party convention was being held in an
                    older, smaller hotel, but it was great for television.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>As I watched, whom do I see sitting at the head table but my Political Officer. I
                    almost fainted. I almost died. I said, “What in the hell is he doing there,
                    sitting at that table?” If I could have called the hotel to get a message to him
                    to get the hell out of there, I would have done so. I died a thousand deaths
                    that night. And, obviously, the government party was watching that TV program,
                    too. I said that I knew that they were going to be sore, wondering what an
                    American Embassy officer was doing, appearing in at the head table at the
                    opposition party convention.</p>
                <p>The next morning I tore a strip off this Political Officer. I said, “Why were you
                    sitting there in such a prominent position? You should have been behind a
                    drape.” He said, “What could I do? They marched me in and sat me down there.”
                    They said, “We've got a chair for Andy, too—over here.” I said, “What are you
                    trying to do, kill me?” I said, “You should have gotten up and walked out. I
                    would rather that those people were 'ticked off' at you. You have driven a nail
                    in my coffin.”</p>
                <p>Well, at his meeting with Secretary Haig, Prime Minister Pindling complained
                    about the activities of the American Embassy, which was supporting the
                    opposition party. What he said amounted to, “It ain't right.”</p>
                <p>Pindling didn't mention the base agreements. I had written in the guidance I had
                    given the Secretary, “Don't get drawn into a conversation about the base
                    agreements. Ask Pindling to go to a meeting tomorrow with Assistant Secretary
                    Enders to discuss the base agreements.” It would have been too hard to get the
                    Secretary of State up to speed on this issue. I could get Assistant Secretary
                    Enders ready for such a discussion. I suggested that the Secretary simply say,
                    “I'd like you to talk to Assistant Secretary Enders about other issues.” Haig
                    followed my suggestions very well.</p>
                <p>One of the other problems we had had a few days before this trip to Washington
                    was that a U. S. Coast Guard cutter had spotted a motor vessel in international
                    waters near the Bahamas. The vessel had no flag, no markings, and apparently no
                    radio equipment on board to respond to the attempts of the Coast Guard to
                    contact it. It looked to be about the size of a typical drug boat. In
                    international waters the Coast Guard challenged vessels of this kind. The cutter
                    chased this boat for a couple of hours, trying to get it to stop so that they
                    could board it, check it out, and find out whether it was carrying contraband.
                    By the time they stopped it and put a boarding party on it, they discovered that
                    it was a Bahamian mail boat traveling between the islands in the Bahamian
                    archipelago. When the Coast Guard boarding party left the boat, both vessels had
                    drifted into Bahamian territorial waters.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>The Coast Guard cutter had not followed the established SOP (Standard Operating
                    Procedure) and signaled Washington—Coast Guard Headquarters and the State
                    Department—and the Embassy that it had had this encounter. I can still remember
                    the name of the Bahamian vessel, the “MV (Motor Vessel) Geleta”. During the
                    chase the crew of the “Geleta” threw a garbage bag overboard. The Coast Guard
                    Cutter retrieved it, and there was a small amount of marijuana in it. The
                    captain of the cutter thought that they were on to something, and they kept
                    chasing the “Geleta.” It turned out that the crew of the “Geleta” was a feckless
                    bunch of Bahamians. They had no radio, didn't fly a flag, and had no markings of
                    any kind. It looked like a drug boat, but it wasn't. But. the captain of the
                    “Geleta” returned to Nassau and screamed bloody murder to the Bahamian
                    Government about “high handed” U. S. Coast Guard activities. So they were all
                    worked up. I had egg on my face. There was egg on the Foreign Minister's face,
                    because he didn't know about it.</p>
                <p>The protocol procedure on this was that Washington would inform me, I would call
                    the Foreign Minister day or night and either tell him that a “drug bust” was
                    going on, that we were about to board a Bahamian vessel, or something like that.
                    He would then give his “OK.” I must say this about the Foreign Minister/Attorney
                    General. On such occasions he was good about that. In fact, I had to call him at
                    4:00 AM a couple of times to tell him that DEA was about to jump on somebody on
                    Bahamian territory and was it all right with him? There were issues of “hot
                    pursuit” and so forth. He was agreeable to things like that. It was only on the
                    more formal things that he was giving me—or giving the U. S.—a hard time.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I could appreciate the fact that the Bahamian Government had “egg on its
                    face” because of the action of the Coast Guard cutter. The Foreign Minister was
                    sore. I had not taken any steps to apologize for this because the Bahamian
                    Government hadn't complained to me. Maybe I should have apologized. We were
                    still trying to figure out what had happened when this trip to Washington came
                    up.</p>
                <p>During Prime Minister Pindling's call on the American Secretary of State he
                    complained about what the Coast Guard had done. He went on and on. Anyhow, bless
                    Haig's heart! He kind of smiled and said, “Well, you know, sometimes there's an
                    excess of zeal, but I'm glad to see that the Coast Guard's on the job.” He cut
                    the ground right out from under what Pindling was complaining about. Pindling
                    was obviously not getting any joy out of Haig on this matter. When we were
                    leaving, after this one hour meeting, Haig “winked” at me. I kind of rolled my
                    eyes in response. As I walked back to Ender's office with Pindling, Tom said,
                    “Well, your guy really sandbagged us.”</p>
                <p>On the next day Pindling met with Enders at 9:00 AM. Enders was late for the
                    appointment because Mike Wallace [TV personality] was harassing Enders about U.
                    S. activities in El Salvador, which was the ultimate undoing of Enders. He was
                    “fired,” when Judge Clark took over as Special Assistant to the President for
                    National Security Affairs over the issue of policy toward El Salvador.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Enders came to the meeting late. We were engaged in small talk while we waited
                    for him. It was very cold on that particular day. Enders said to Prime Minister
                    Pindling, “Well, Prime Minister, what's the situation?” I had called the Embassy
                    in Nassau that morning and talked with the Political Officer to see how
                    everything was going and to make sure that there had been no “blow up's.” There
                    was no news of great relevance from the Embassy in Nassau. So in response to
                    Enders' question, Pindling leaned back and said, “Is it customary for the United
                    States Government, in discussions with a foreign government leader, to make
                    public announcements about the agenda for meetings he's supposed to have and
                    comment on the substance of the meetings that he's undertaking?” There was a
                    great silence. Enders looked at me, and I looked at him. We wondered what he was
                    talking about. Pindling went on in that vein for a while. I slipped out of the
                    meeting room and called the Embassy in Nassau to talk to the Political Officer.
                    I said, “What is Pindling talking about? What's going on?” The Political Officer
                    said, “Oh, in the 'Nassau Guardian' this morning there was an article to which
                    apparently our Public Affairs Officer had contributed. It said that Pindling was
                    meeting with the Secretary of State and would be discussing various pending
                    issues.”</p>
                <p>Evidently, Pindling had decided to get up on his high horse and ride this issue
                    for all it was worth. He was angry, he was ticked off, he felt he had been
                    insulted, pushed around, or whatever. Nothing was mentioned in the press article
                    about the substance of the issues. I figured out eventually that this was all a
                    “setup” by Pindling. The only thing that had gone right was that, because of a
                    conflict of scheduling, he was going to “dump” all this on Secretary Haig. As it
                    turned out, he only dumped it on Enders. I figured that, if Pindling had dumped
                    this on Haig, I would still be explaining what the hell had happened 10 years
                    later. Thank God we didn't let him see the President! I'd be folding blankets
                    some place.</p>
                <p>Pindling was very clever. He understood very well how the United States
                    Government worked. When I got back to Nassau, I tore strips off both the Public
                    Affairs Officer and the Political Officer. I said, “What the hell were your guys
                    doing? Why were you so inept? I was up there in Washington, holding the fort,
                    and you guys let these people walk all over us. You should have said, 'No
                    comment'—on anything.”</p>
                <p>The Political Officer decided to request a transfer after that. It was fairly
                    early in his tour. He was a nice guy and very bright, and we had had a good
                    relationship. He really screwed up twice and drove at least two nails into my
                    personal coffin.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>The Public Affairs Officer was the first USIA [United States Information Agency]
                    officer assigned to Nassau. Until that time USIS [United States Information
                    Service, the overseas service of USIA] just had a local, contract employee to
                    handle USIS activity. The Public Affairs Officer was “certifiable”—he was
                    mentally unbalanced, very unhappy to be there, and his family wasn't with him.
                    He became a major management problem for me. I had a good excuse to “fire” him
                    and get rid of him, because he had really screwed up in this instance, and
                    nobody would have faulted me for it. However, I decided that I would not do
                    this. I would look better if I “rehabilitated” this character, rather than use
                    my obvious authority and “fire” him. And as he was the first USIS officer
                    assigned to the Embassy, “firing” him would not look good. In retrospect, I
                    should have “fired” him, because he did me “dirt” subsequently, when the Foreign
                    Service Inspectors came. He “bad mouthed” me to the inspectors, unjustifiably
                    so.</p>
                <p>When you are placed in this position and are faced with decisions, you have to
                    choose what to do. Should you be a “good” guy or a “tough” guy. To this day I'm
                    not quite sure whether I made the right decision—whether I should have “fired”
                    these two guys, “fired” them out of a cannon, or what. But that's what you're
                    faced with.</p>
                <p>Let me just finish this story. In early February, 1982, while I was up here in
                    Washington, D. C. with Pindling. I went over to the National War College. They
                    had an afternoon seminar, and I had some free time. I went over there to cadge a
                    free drink at a reception later in the afternoon. Somehow, I ran into a guy who
                    was the Assistant Inspector General of The Department at that time. He had been
                    one of the senior officers who had inspected the Embassy in Nassau in 1980.</p>
                <p>One of the management problems I had in the Embassy in Nassau was that it still
                    had essentially the same Foreign Service Local and American complement as it had
                    when it was a Consulate General, prior to independence. While that wasn't too
                    bad on the substantive side, on the administrative side it was “murder.” We were
                    not a Consulate General. We were an Embassy. I was very concerned about the fact
                    that I didn't have an American citizen Budget and Fiscal Officer. I had an
                    American Administrative Officer, but he did everything. He wasn't a Budget and
                    Fiscal Officer. One of the things that I had been pushing was how to get another
                    position out of the Department and have a Budget and Fiscal Officer assigned. I
                    was concerned about my own personal, financial responsibility for fiscal
                    matters. For example, we had a local employee assigned to the Consular Section
                    who worked on the preparation of passports for issuance. She had “ripped off”
                    [stolen] the receipts for passports to the extent of about 800 Bahamian dollars,
                    because the Consular Officers were not observing the proper receipt procedures.
                    A Budget and Fiscal Officer would have caught that. As it turned out, there was
                    no loss of money because we managed to hold back this employee's pay and then we
                    fired her. That was simply proof to me that we had a Bahamanian local employee
                    who was doing the Budget and Fiscal work, while we, the American employees,
                    really didn't know what was going on. I thought that I was the guy who was going
                    to go to prison at Ft. Leavenworth, given the experience I had in connection
                    with the visa “scam” in the Embassy in Bangkok. I was nervous about this.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>So I asked the Assistant Inspector General, “How do I handle this? You noted this
                    problem in your 1980 inspection report. You said that the administrative side of
                    the Embassy in Nassau needs more support. Can you tell me how to go about
                    getting another position.” Now, the Executive Director of ARA was a friend of
                    mine. I could call him up and talk to him any time. I also spoke to Ambassador
                    Robert Miller who had been in charge of Indochina matters during one period when
                    I was in EA who was in charge of “M/MO” at the time...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Management Operations.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Management Operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me stop here to turn the tape over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: He finished his career as Ambassador to one of the African countries
                    but was in charge of Management Operations at this time. I could call him up,
                    talk to him, and ask how we could get an additional position. I said that I
                    needed help down in the Embassy in Nassau. So having pushed even personal
                    connections and all the “buttons” that I could push, I still was getting no
                    action in terms of an additional position. There was supposed to be a “floating”
                    Budget and Fiscal Officer who was nominally based in the Embassy in Kingston,
                    Jamaica, who was supposed to come around and check the books. However, the guy
                    had never shown up in Nassau in living memory. The Assistant Inspector General
                    said to me, “Look, you can request a “special inspection” at any time, just on
                    administrative affairs, to reinforce the need for this position. I recommend
                    that you do that.” So that was one thing that I did.During this same time my
                    friend Upston, the “Caribbean Coordinator” in ARA, told me that the South
                    Florida business community was so concerned about how crime had taken over in
                    South Florida, particularly following the “Mariel” boat lift [the flow of Cuban
                    refugees to the United States in small boats in 1980], the influx of Haitians,
                    and the “narcodollars” that were flowing into South Florida, that, in their
                    view, it was becoming like the “Wild West.” They felt that local authorities
                    were losing control of the situation in South Florida.</p>
                <p>The business community, led by the President of Eastern Airlines and former
                    astronaut, Frank Borman, had asked President Reagan to “send the troops in,”
                    that is, to send Federal troops in to help to restore order. President Reagan
                    agreed to help in the establishment of a South Florida Task Force on Crime and
                    he put Vice President George Bush in charge.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>So Upston, the “Caribbean Coordinator,” and I went over to call on Bush's chief
                    of staff, Admiral Dan Murphy, just to introduce ourselves and talk about the
                    “crime problem” in the Caribbean. I tried to explain to Admiral Murphy that he
                    couldn't really understand what was happening in South Florida if he didn't know
                    something about what was happening in the Bahamas, which was sort of the “Ho Chi
                    Minh Trail” of narcotics, illegal aliens, and other skullduggery which had a
                    definite impact on what was going on in South Florida.</p>
                <p>The South Florida Task Force on Crime was established. I unilaterally enlisted my
                    Embassy in Nassau in the task force. I wasn't invited. I just said, “I'm joining
                    up.” I used my own travel allocation to go to Miami periodically to sit in on
                    Task Force meetings and report on what was going on in the Bahamas. With that we
                    managed to follow through on the DEA proposal for the operation against Norman's
                    Cay, although by that time DEA had withdrawn its request to make a “hostile
                    takeover” of Norman's Key to arrest the Colombians.</p>
                <p>There was still a proposal on the table about using American helicopters and
                    aircraft to carry Bahamian Police on drug raids—in other words, to facilitate
                    the delivery of Bahamian law enforcement personnel. During the Carter
                    administration Prime Minister Pindling had made a request to the American
                    Government for $25 million in assistance, including communications equipment,
                    boats, and helicopters. Of course, people in Washington just laughed themselves
                    sick when they saw this request. Two years later we finally delivered two
                    “Boston Whaler” boats with spare engines to the Bahamian Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are small...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Small, outboard motor powered boats. They're good for use on the open
                    seas, but they didn't amount to $25 million in “goodies”—and this was another
                    issue that Prime Minister Pindling was angry about. He felt that we kept
                    hammering the Bahamas for assistance with our problems with drugs, but we
                    wouldn't give the Bahamas any help. I'll tell you, I was one embarrassed
                    character when I went down to hand over these boats to the Bahamian Police.</p>
                <p>We finally obtained agreement that we would present a proposal to use American
                    transportation assets to carry Bahamian law enforcement people. I thought that
                    it was rather problematical that the Bahamian Foreign Minister/Attorney General
                    would accept this proposal, particularly since he was no friend of mine at this
                    point. However, we put the proposal together. I drafted it on behalf of DEA and
                    sent it on to the State Department. Upston, who happened to be the only guy in
                    ARA at that particular time, dealt with it. He talked it over with Assistant
                    Secretary Enders. However, Enders by that time wouldn't sign his name to
                    anything. He indicated to Upston to “deal with it as you see fit.” This proposal
                    had not been vetted with anyone else in the State Department or with the law
                    enforcement community more generally in Washington. Upston simply sent me back a
                    one-line cable, signed “Haig” and saying, “Proceed as you see fit.”</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>So the ball had been lateraled back to me. I felt, “Well, let's go for it.” I put
                    the proposal up to the Foreign Ministry, fully expecting that the Foreign
                    Minister was going to reject it out of hand. I thought that he would not agree
                    to let the Americans come tramping through the Bahamas. Much to my surprise, the
                    Foreign Minister agreed that we could do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not stop at this point? Would you explain what we're
                        talking about, so we'll know when we resume?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: OK, we're talking about the establishment of what we called, “Operation
                    BAT.” This doesn't stand for the mammal. It stands for “Bahamas, America, Turks
                    and Caicos.” This was the first time in American history that American
                    transportation and other equipment assets were used to take foreign law
                    enforcement people to fight crime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick it up from there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: OK.</p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 18, 1994, Andy. You were talking about
                        Operation BAT. Please continue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: OK. As I said, I was really surprised that the Bahamian Government
                    agreed to use American transportation assets to take Bahamian police on
                    operations against the narcotics traffickers.</p>
                <p>We're talking now about 1982. It was very clear to me that the Bahamian
                    Government was very much involved in drug trafficking. The Foreign
                    Minister/Attorney General was not. I don't think that he was corrupt. I think
                    that he was “certifiable”—he just had a loose screw. He was brilliant, an
                    intellectual, loquacious, honest as the day is long, but not intellectually
                    honest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Bahamian Government agreed to this proposal. Can
                        you figure out why they accepted it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I think that it was like the appointment of the Ambassador. I think
                    that they “blinked.” They lost their nerve in terms of not permitting the
                    Americans to do what we wanted to do. I think that they could not openly refuse
                    the United States to exercise the right of “hot pursuit” and chase the “bad
                    guys.” The situation was getting very grim in the United States. The amount of
                    narcotics coming into the United States was enormous. The money laundering
                    operation was on a very large scale in the southeastern part of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>I remember a statistic that I heard. At the time of the economic recession of
                    1980-82 the only Federal Reserve District in the United States that had a
                    positive cash flow was South Florida. Buildings were going up, and money was
                    changing hands in a big way. The “bad guys” [the drug traffickers] were “buying”
                    entire local governments. Of course, I'm not talking about the Haitian
                    situation, which was also complicating things. It really was a very fragile
                    period of time.</p>
                <p>Don't forget. Nothing starts at “ground zero.” A lot of people, particularly in
                    Florida—I'm thinking now of Broward County—had very “hard feelings” toward the
                    Bahamas, particularly toward Pindling and company. They could clearly see, from
                    across the Straits of Florida, the nature of the problem. Of course, the Federal
                    authorities just weren't dealing with it. I think that the Bahamians came to
                    understand that they had better watch their step.</p>
                <p>The Reagan administration was doing some very unconventional things in terms of
                    indicting people. For example, they started the practice of telling
                    international banks that if they wanted to do business in the United States,
                    they would have to open up their secret files to United States prosecutors. That
                    really “blew” some minds at that time. A lot of countries were very
                    uncomfortable with that. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher [of Great Britain] as
                    well as the government of Canada were very unhappy and uncomfortable with this
                    action by the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>I remember that the Bank of Nova Scotia was told in no uncertain terms, “We want
                    to know what you've got on your books in the Bahamas. If you want to do business
                    in the United States, this is what you're going to have to do.” Well, this was
                    quite a departure in terms of respect for sovereign immunity. I think that was
                    one of the reasons why the Bahamian Government accepted our proposal. Before I
                    get into a discussion of Operation BAT, I'd like to talk about the appointment
                    of the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that when I was assigned to the Bahamas, I was told by Assistant
                    Secretary Tom Enders to expect a political appointee as the Ambassador. He
                    wanted me to be a “strong” DCM and run the Embassy. He couldn't tell me when
                    we'd get an Ambassador. It might be a matter of weeks, it could be longer.So I
                    went down to Nassau simply with the expectation of “doing my job.” However, it
                    became very apparent, after several months, that a number of people had been
                    selected for appointment as Ambassador but were not being “cleared” for one
                    reason or another. Given the way things were developing, we weren't going to
                    have an Ambassador for a long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>The Bahamian Government deeply resented the fact that no Ambassador had been
                    appointed. They looked on this as a deliberate slight on the part of the Reagan
                    administration, intended to send a very clear, political message to the voters
                    of the Bahamas. There was an election coming up in June, 1982, and the United
                    States Government was apparently displeased with the Pindling administration. In
                    the view of the Bahamian Government that was the reason why there was no
                    American Ambassador assigned to Nassau. Of course, the Bahamian opposition
                    really beat the drum on this. I was sitting in the “hot seat.” I was having
                    people and politicians come up to me and say, “Why isn't there an American
                    Ambassador here? Why are you guys doing this to us?” This makes it hard to
                    explain this failure to appoint an Ambassador by saying, “Well, that's the way
                    it is,” and that it is not anyone's fault.</p>
                <p>Finally, we got the word that Professor Lev Dobriansky who, I believe, had taught
                    at Georgetown University, had been nominated to be the Ambassador to the Bahamas
                    in the late Summer of 1982. That is, the request for agr�ment was put to the
                    Bahamas' government. Dobriansky had a very long record as a conservative
                    Republican. He was of Ukrainian background, had something of a reputation as a
                    Ukrainian “freedom fighter,” and was very anti-communist in his views. In fact,
                    when he finally arrived in Nassau, set up shop, and hung up his pictures on the
                    wall of his office, it really looked like the political spectrum to the right of
                    Genghis Khan. There were pictures of Park Chung Hee [of South Korea], Chiang
                    Kai-shek [of Nationalist China]—you name it. All of these anti-communists going
                    way back. His daughter, Paula, became a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State
                    Department and was an NSC [National Security Council] staffer at one time. She's
                    very bright.</p>
                <p>When Dobriansky's nomination as Ambassador was surfaced, it was about at the same
                    time that we were cranking up Operation BAT—the spring and summer of 1982. I
                    received instructions to request agr�ment and passed it on to the Foreign
                    Ministry. The Foreign Minister was aghast. He didn't like it. He didn't like
                    Dobriansky. He said that he wanted to get a collection of his writings. He
                    looked at Ambassador Dobriansky's record and said to me, what am I going to talk
                    to this man about? What does he know about the Caribbean or the Bahamas?”</p>
                <p>More than that, I think that the Bahamians were a little apprehensive about how
                    the Cubans might take this appointment. It might look to the Cubans that we were
                    kind of surrounding Cuba. The Bahamas had had its own problems with Cuba. They
                    had a patrol boat strafed and sunk by a Cuban MiG fighter [Soviet made aircraft]
                    in 1980. The Bahamians were very nervous about Cuban activism. There were some
                    people within the Pindling government who were trying to come to an
                    accommodation with Cuba. We're talking now about a period of increased tension
                    in the Caribbean. Grenada was seen as a place where the Cubans and Russians were
                    “up to no good.” There were even reports that missiles were being emplaced in
                    Grenada.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>After I requested agr�ment by diplomatic note, I waited and waited and waited. I
                    thought, “If this nomination is going to go the way of the base agreements,
                    we're going to have a problem.” The Department was starting to “prod” me about
                    obtaining agr�ment for Ambassador Dobriansky. I was receiving cables, asking
                    “What was the status of agr�ment?” Assistant Secretary Tom Enders called me up
                    one time and said, “What's the problem down there and what are your
                    recommendations for action?” I replied, “Tom, they really don't want this guy. I
                    recommend that we do nothing. I'll go in and push if you want. However, if I go
                    in and push, they're liable to say 'No.'” Adderly had done this once before with
                    a nomination from the Ford Administration. I said that they really object to
                    him, more on ideological grounds than anything else. Enders, in turn, was being
                    “pushed” by the White House. Like every good Foreign Service Officer who wanted
                    appointment to another Embassy, he didn't want to irritate the Director of
                    Personnel in the White House. So the pressure came on down to me.</p>
                <p>I remember attending a party on Paradise Island at the house of Kevin McClory,
                    the producer of the last James Bond film in which Sean Connery acted. Connery
                    was also a resident of the Bahamas. I was at a party at McClory's house one
                    night. Two of Pindling's cabinet ministers were there. I was on speaking terms
                    with them, and they were friendly enough. However, both of them were as corrupt
                    as the day is long. They actually were sort of charming “rogues.” They were very
                    much “in their cups” that night. They came up to me and said, “Why are you
                    sending this guy Dobriansky to us? We don't want him.” Obviously, they had
                    listened to the Foreign Minister at a cabinet meeting. No one, not even the
                    Prime Minister contradicted the Foreign Minister. I said, “Listen. I'm only the
                    messenger. If you don't want this guy, you just tell me, and I'll pass the word
                    back. It's not up to me to decide things like this.”</p>
                <p>Subsequently, in a matter of weeks, the Bahamian Government “blinked” and gave
                    their agr�ment to the appointment of Ambassador Dobriansky. Evidently, there was
                    some concern in the Bahamas about the U. S. as “big brother” and how “big
                    brother” could really hurt the Bahamas if it chose to. I think that that's what
                    happened on “Operation BAT”. I suspect that they probably thought, “Well, let
                    them do what they want. They're not going to have a hell of a lot of impact,”
                    based on what we were proposing, which was to assign a helicopter or two to the
                    Bahamas to carry out the mission. In fact, if you look at what we started out
                    with, it was not very prepossessing.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>The DEA managed to rent or acquire in some fashion a very much used Army HU-1
                    “Huey” helicopter from some depot in Texas. It was painted black, but you could
                    still see through the paint a 1st Cavalry Division patch and a Red Cross. It had
                    probably been used as a medical evacuation helicopter in Vietnam. DEA had
                    provided only one pilot and no crew. Every “Huey” helicopter I flew in Vietnam
                    and elsewhere had a crew of four people to run it. I discovered that DEA had
                    only one guy to run this whole machine, moreover, a single engine aircraft. It
                    was a UH-1G model, I think. The UH-1H, I think, was a two engine helicopter.
                    This meant that if the DEA helicopter “crapped out” in flight, you had a
                    problem. Initially and for the first several months I went on several of the
                    flights, just to see how things were done in taking the Bahamian police on some
                    of these missions. I must say that I was very nervous about the fact that the
                    helicopter could not land on the water. There's a lot of water in the Bahamas,
                    and some of it is very deep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the first six feet are the most critical. After
                        that, you don't have to worry about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. Eventually, they managed to put “floats” on the helicopter.
                    But the helicopter could only operate for 100 hours before it had to be “rotated
                    back” to the U.S. for a major overhaul in Florida. There were no facilities for
                    major maintenance in the Bahamas. Florida is more than 200 miles away. So the
                    number of missions you could actually fly with a “one lunger” Huey helicopter
                    was very limited. On top of that, there was the questionable ability of the
                    Bahamians to go out and arrest anybody. We had already had some experience with
                    this and knew that some of the senior police officers were corrupt and would
                    signal the “bad guys” [the drug traffickers] that they were coming to make a
                    raid.</p>
                <p>So we began the operation, running it out of the DEA office in the Embassy in
                    Nassau. We brought in some communications equipment to talk to the helicopter.
                    We would set up missions but wouldn't tell the Bahamian Police where we were
                    going until we got the cops on the plane and were airborne. It was that kind of
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>As I mentioned before, on Andros Island, the largest island in the Bahamian
                    archipelago, due West of Nassau, we had “AUTEC,” the Atlantic Underwater Test
                    and Evaluation Center. Collocated at AUTEC was a [U. S.] Customs Department
                    radar, aimed to the Southeast, in other words, aimed down the “Slot” or the
                    chain of the Bahamas toward Cuba, so that it could detect aircraft that would
                    come up the “Slot,” around Guantanamo and between Hispaniola and the North coast
                    of Cuba, heading for Florida. Unfortunately, this was a military radar, operated
                    by the Customs Department It was not continuously on the air. It wasn't manned
                    24 hours a day. Frequently, we would find that an aircraft was coming up from
                    Colombia, making the run up the “Slot.” We would call over to AUTEC to see if
                    the radar was on. Sometimes, the operator wouldn't be around. We would have a
                    real problem because we very much needed a vector [a heading]. By the time the
                    “bad guy” was flying along the North coast of Cuba, we had to guess what the
                    direction was. Was he heading for the State of Georgia, for the Florida Keys, or
                    where? We needed to know. If we were going to send a helicopter out to intercept
                    this aircraft, we had to know where he was headed.</p>
                <p>After Admiral Murphy set up the Federal Task Force in Florida, I used to go over
                    to its meetings. I handled all of my own contacts with the Coast Guard, the DEA,
                    the FBI, and, most importantly, with Admiral Murphy's office. When I would have
                    problems with U. S. Customs, such as not having the radar “operating” on Andros
                    Island, I would call Admiral Murphy and say, “Damn it. We have a [suspected drug
                    smuggling] plane in the air now. We don't know where he's going because the U.
                    S. Customs can't seem to get their act together.” And so on. Anyhow, that's how
                    we handled this matter.</p>
                <p>Once we got a DEA flight “team” on the ground, I decided we would position the
                    helicopter at the Police Training College in Nassau, located on what used to be
                    called Oakes Field, which was once the airport in the Bahamas. We had built that
                    airport during World War II as a landing point for the aircraft which we were
                    ferrying through the Bahamas to Europe or Africa. Until the 1960's it was the
                    commercial airport in Nassau, until they built the international airport farther
                    out on [New Providence] island. The Bahamian Police had set up a police training
                    college at Oakes Field. It had a secure area. I decided that we would put the
                    DEA helicopter at the Police College, because I was afraid to leave it out at
                    the international airport, for fear that the Colombian drug traffickers would
                    sabotage it. The Colombians would be out at the international airport servicing
                    their own aircraft. If the DEA helicopter were there, without much of a team to
                    protect it, it would be easy to sabotage it. If the DEA helicopter were at the
                    Police College, it was more unlikely that a Colombian would come by and pour
                    sugar in the fuel tank, or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>The next requirement was the need for communications. It was very evident that we
                    didn't have the means of talking to the helicopter very well while it was in the
                    air or talk to the U. S. Navy Base in Guantanamo, which also had a radar. It was
                    also difficult to talk to AUTEC, which is where the U. S. Customs radar was
                    located. More importantly, once the DEA and the Bahamian Police were out on a
                    mission, we couldn't talk to them and had no way of knowing what they were up
                    to. If the helicopter went “down,” we wouldn't know that it was “down” or where.
                    One of my biggest chores became the effort to try to get some communications
                    equipment.</p>
                <p>It turned out that one of my instructors at the National War College was an Army
                    Lieutenant Colonel with whom I had become very friendly. He was originally from
                    New Hampshire and taught “American political history” at the National War
                    College. Anyway, he was very helpful. His assignment after the National War
                    College tour as an instructor was in the office of the Secretary of the Army. He
                    was put to work on problems like the one I had encountered—assistance to
                    civilian law enforcement. I got in touch with him. He became my “prime mover” in
                    trying to get some surplus military communications equipment in place at the
                    Embassy so that we could communicate with the law enforcement world. We were
                    then just going through the hassle over the “posse comitatus law” between the U.
                    S. law enforcement community and the Department of Defense over assistance to
                    law enforcement organizations.</p>
                <p>For example, U. S. Navy vessels would come into Nassau twice a month, on the
                    average. Nassau was a major port of call for ships coming out of Norfolk, VA. It
                    seemed that if we didn't have a Navy ship in port, we'd have a Coast Guard
                    vessel. I went aboard an awful lot of ships, doing my “thing” as charg�
                    d'affaires. I entertained some of the ships' officers and got to know them. For
                    example, we once had a visit from the USS INGERSOLL, a Navy destroyer which
                    carried both guns and missiles. It was one of the newer types, built since World
                    War II. The skipper of the INGERSOLL was a very friendly Navy Captain. When I
                    went aboard, they gave me a tour of the ship, including the Combat Command
                    Center. They told me how, using radar, they could vector weapons systems and
                    could “play war games” to keep up the skills of the crew. I asked them, “Do you
                    guys ever do anything when you see a drug airplane fly overhead? It must happen
                    all the time. Do you do anything about that? Do you tell anybody?” The Captain
                    said, “No, we have no requirement to report on this kind of activity. Even if we
                    should see, for example, an aircraft making a drop [of some kind of packages],
                    we wouldn't tell anybody. There's no requirement for us to do anything about
                    it.”</p>
                <p>It “blew my mind” that we had all of these assets floating around there playing
                    “war games”—kind of like computer games—to keep up the training of their crews.
                    One of these aircraft could be offloading a month's supply of cocaine, and the
                    Navy ship wouldn't tell anybody, much less chase them or anything like that.
                    Some of the skippers on these Navy ships were very sympathetic to the view that
                    they should be doing more about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>I remember that the INGERSOLL had to “clear port” one day because of a conflict
                    in the cruise ship schedule. They had to make room at the pier. They had to get
                    permission from Norfolk. Normally, a Navy ship doesn't leave port once it comes
                    in. It stays for a couple of days and then leaves. “Clearing port” early is an
                    added expense and some trouble, but on this particular occasion they had to
                    “clear port.”</p>
                <p>The skipper said, “Would you like to bring some of your people from the Embassy
                    on board? We'll just take a little ride outside the island.” I said, “Sure, why
                    not?” The skipper said, “Well, where should we go?” I said, “There are a couple
                    of islands about 30 miles North of here which, I know, are major dropping points
                    for drugs. Planes come in and drop the packages. Why don't we go over there and
                    take a look?” We did. I got a whole bunch of people from the Embassy who wanted
                    to go out and take a ride one morning. So the INGERSOLL showed up off this
                    island. They put a long boat over the side, and we went out to take a look. I
                    think that we scared the hell out of somebody.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was clear to me that the Defense Department wasn't really “on board”
                    on this drug enforcement effort. Of course, the argument on the military side
                    was that this kind of activity detracts from their primary mission, which is
                    training for war. It's kind of like the debate which we're having today about
                    whether or not the military should be carrying out “peace-keeping” missions
                    which detract from their fundamental commitments. These “peace-keeping” missions
                    also cost a lot of money for fuel and so forth. At that time the argument was
                    that the military were prevented from law enforcement activities under the post
                    Civil War “Posse Comitatus” Act. This act was passed as a result of the
                    occupation of the South by the Union Army. It provided that the military would
                    not carry on law enforcement functions. So the Defense Department used to take
                    cover behind that law. Eventually, the “Posse Comitatus” Act was modified to
                    allow the military to take on law enforcement missions. In fact, after the Cold
                    War was over, as you may recall, the military went around “looking for a
                    mission.” They needed to justify their existence and their assets. But at the
                    time, in 1982, we had this frustration of really needing to have our armed
                    forces to go out and chase the drug traffickers.</p>
                <p>All things come to those who wait and try. Eventually, the military decided that
                    we needed more than this “one lung” helicopter with one pilot with very limited
                    “loiter” time. It was becoming very clear to the law enforcement community that
                    there was a lot happening in the Bahamas, and we weren't dealing with it.</p>
                <p>For example, at one time the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] reported that
                    they were doing a “surveillance” flight over Bimini Island. Flying at about
                    10,000 feet, at night, using night vision equipment, they watched a drug
                    aircraft being unloaded by the Bahamian Police. It was quite clear to everyone
                    that we had to do something about tightening the screws in the Bahamas.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>A plan was devised to deal with this situation. One of its major components was
                    to station several radar “blimps” in the Bahamas. One of them had already been
                    emplaced in Key West, 80 miles Southwest of Miami, which kept an eye on military
                    aircraft activity, particularly in Mariel [Pinar del Rio province in Cuba]. The
                    “blimp” or “balloon” in Key West was called “Fat Albert.” The Reagan
                    administration proposed to put additional blimps in strategic locations in the
                    Bahamas where they could monitor drug aircraft coming through the Bahamas. The
                    Bahamian Foreign Minister/Attorney General was less eager to do that. He gave us
                    a hard time. However, Congress was very much in favor of it. There were several
                    Congressional Committees which were eager to have these blimps emplaced.
                    Hearings were held on this and other proposals in 1983. In fact, a Congressional
                    Committee of 21 Congressmen came down to the Bahamas to look the situation over,
                    meet with Prime Minister Pindling and company, and come to some conclusions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to stop and ask a question here. 21 Members
                        of Congress come down for a visit. Obviously, there is a charg� d'affaires
                        in charge of the Embassy. You brief them...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I briefed them. I took them around. In fact, I went over to Key West
                    with them to look at “Fat Albert.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But a Congressman is going to say, “OK, Mr. Antippas. Are
                        these guys in the Bahamian Government 'on the take?'” How did you
                        respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I said, “They are.” I said, “Basically, these people aren't friends of
                    ours. They're helping us [to some extent] because they have to help us, but,
                    basically, we're having a very hard time here. Our efforts haven't been that
                    successful.” A lot of the Congressmen knew this. Don't forget, we had people in
                    the Congressional group like Rep. Mike Barnes, who used to be the Congressman
                    for Montgomery County [in Maryland]. He headed up a subcommittee on Latin
                    American Affairs. We had Rep. Dan Mica, a Republican Congressman from Ft.
                    Lauderdale or somewhere on the Atlantic coast of Florida. He knew very well what
                    was going on. The Congressional delegation from Florida was very well informed.
                    The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Dante Fascell, who has
                    since retired, talked to me about Prime Minister Pindling in scatological
                    terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't telling them anything “out of school” on
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You would have to be really disingenuous to wring your hands and say,
                    “These are great fellows.” Nonsense. Actually, the Bahamian government had a
                    number of objectionable people who were not friends of the United States. They
                    hurt us in many ways. A lot of things were hanging fire because of their
                    obduracy, going way back to the effort to arrest Robert Vesco.</p>
                <p>I have to tell you about my effort to get an aircraft for the Bahamians. As I
                    said before, the Bahamians complained bitterly that we were putting all this
                    pressure on them to do something. As Prime Minister Pindling told Vice President
                    Bush in Miami in December, 1982, in my presence, “You have all of this ability
                    in the United States, and you can't stop the drug aircraft or drug boats from
                    coming in. We have one control tower in all of the Bahamas, no Air Force, and
                    not much of a Navy. How do you expect us to stop the drug traffic?” Vice
                    President Bush got very angry about that barbed comment.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned before, the Bahamian Government had given the Carter
                    administration a shopping list of $25 million for equipment which they wanted to
                    support the anti-drug effort, including helicopters, boats, weapons,
                    communications gear, and other things. The Carter administration replied, “No
                    way we're going to give these guys this equipment because it's very clear to us
                    that the Bahamians aren't going to do anything with it.” There was also the view
                    that helicopters were a very expensive proposition to run. Unlike fixed wing
                    aircraft, they are really expensive in terms of maintenance, apart from the
                    training of air crew. They're certainly very useful, but their cost
                    effectiveness is really questionable under the circumstances.</p>
                <p>A friend of mine in the Department who was very interested in aviation contacted
                    me and told me that in the aircraft “bone yard” in Florida there was a Grumman
                    “Widgeon” seaplane which had just been retired by the Department of the
                    Interior. Interior had used this plane to make resupply flights from Miami down
                    to Ft. Washington...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Dry Tortugas, where Dr. Samuel Mudd...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The Dry Tortugas. Samuel Mudd was the best-known prisoner. It was
                    really “back of beyond” and a long way from anywhere. I guess that the Interior
                    Department decided that it couldn't afford to keep this plane going any more, so
                    they retired it. This fellow told me about it. So one day I took a trip over
                    there to take a look at this thing. The aircraft “bone yard” was located South
                    of Homestead Air Force Base. I thought, “This would be perfect for the Bahamas.
                    That's exactly what they need—a seaplane which could be refurbished.” It would
                    allow them to carry Bahamian Police as fast as a helicopter, although they were
                    not quite as effective. More importantly, it could land on water and could
                    deliver the police where they were needed. It would do the job and was a lot
                    cheaper than a helicopter.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>I “sold” the Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Affairs. At that time
                    the Assistant Secretary was a Republican political appointee from New York state
                    who later went on to become a federal judge. He was quite helpful. It turned out
                    that the desk officer in INM [Bureau of International Narcotics Affairs], who
                    was handling the Bahamas, was a consular officer whom I knew. He was also very
                    friendly and helpful. I said, “Look, you've got to get this plane for me. The
                    Department of the Interior will give us the airplane. If you can scratch up
                    $40-50,000, we can refurbish the engines and plane. We would need some money for
                    pilot training—and we'll get the Bahamians to fly it.”</p>
                <p>The military advisers to the Bahamas at that time were still the British. The
                    Commodore of the Bahamian Defense Forces was a serving Royal Navy officer who
                    was very friendly to us. He had always been very accommodating. His second in
                    command, who actually ran the logistics base on New providence Island, was a
                    retired Royal Navy officer. He was also very friendly to the United States. He
                    had an American wife.</p>
                <p>They had an Royal Navy flying officer assigned to the Bahamas, who flew a “leased
                    plane” for the Bahamian Defense Forces. I worked out a deal. I said, “Look, if I
                    can acquire this plane, would you agree to use it? I'll look stupid if we go to
                    the expense of acquiring this airplane and then you guys won't use it.” I said,
                    “We will arrange to provide flight training on seaplanes for a Bahamian pilot.”
                    Obviously, the British weren't going to be there forever. They agreed that they
                    would do this. The wheels were set in motion, I got the money, we got the plane
                    signed over to the State Department, and we actually had this plan moving toward
                    fruition. We actually were going to get this aircraft.</p>
                <p>Before that happened, we had this Congressional “flying circus” come to Nassau—21
                    Congressmen who decided that they were going to “put the screws” to the Reagan
                    administration's efforts on drug enforcement. I think that it was Congressman
                    Glen English of Ohio who was the head of this special Congressional committee,
                    who came to Nassau with his 20 colleagues. We had meetings. We went around and
                    looked at this, that, and the other thing. As I said, we went over to Key West
                    and looked at “Fat Albert,” the blimp. Then he decided to have hearings in
                    Miami, to which I was subpoenaed to appear, as the charg� d'affaires in the
                    Bahamas. The Assistant Secretary for International Narcotics Affairs was also
                    subpoenaed to testify before this committee. Congressman English took the
                    Assistant Secretary “over the hurdles” for the fact that IN/M had done so little
                    for the Bahamas, in terms of providing them with resources. The Assistant
                    Secretary just “took his lumps.” Congressman English even took me “over the
                    hurdles” and said, “Is this the best that the United States Government can do
                    for the Bahamas—to give them a 40-year-old airplane to chase down the 'bad
                    guys?'” Of course, I tried to explain what the situation was.</p>
                <p>The hearing was over, and we were walking out of the building. Congressman
                    English came up to me and apologized. He said, “We have to do that. It's
                    politics.” Actually, it had been a very useful session.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>As I'll tell you subsequently about my adventure in getting “kicked out” of the
                    Bahamas, I actually came out of these hearings, “smelling like a rose.” I had
                    tried to do something of utility. I looked good and the Department looked
                    good.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Operation BAT finally didn't get the seaplane because the British “double
                    crossed” us. They said that they didn't want the airplane because they were
                    under pressure to get the Bahamians to buy a British aircraft for their use—but
                    land based. It had no ability to land anywhere except a runway. There were very
                    few runways available. This was totally counter to what I was trying to “sell”
                    them. To get to most of the places where the “bad guys” congregated, you either
                    needed a helicopter or a seaplane. The drug traffickers were using air drops and
                    “cigarette type” speedboats, which can go 60 miles an hour. We needed an
                    aircraft to catch them. There are no ships which can chase these boats, even
                    though the U. S. Navy put into service in the Caribbean area several hydrofoils.
                    One of them, the USS TAURUS, once visited Nassau. I looked a little bit stupid
                    because we had an airplane which we couldn't use. I don't know what happened to
                    the old Grumman “Widgeon.” I don't know whether the Department used it elsewhere
                    or everybody kind of “fell on their swords.” I never forgave the British for
                    that. I did have one other idea that I was working on. There was an island South
                    of Bimini Island. Bimini is the closest Bahamian island to Florida and a very
                    natural, staging point for all kinds of “shenanigans” going on, aimed at the
                    United States—illegal aliens, narcotics, money laundering, you name it. They
                    even had banks on Bimini Island for money laundering.</p>
                <p>South of Bimini there is an island, basically composed of sand. I think its
                    called “Ocean Island”. It was mostly man-made and had digging and earth-moving
                    gear on it to mine the sand of which it is composed. This sand is called,
                    “Aragonite.” [According to the dictionary, aragonite is calcium carbonate in
                    orthorhombic crystals with less distinctive cleavage and greater density than
                    calcite]. This is industrial sand which is mined for making glass for automobile
                    windshields. The island was owned by an American company which mined the sand
                    and shipped it to industrial locations.</p>
                <p>You didn't have to be a tactical genius to figure out that we had to do something
                    to stop these speedboats, which were the primary means of moving high value
                    narcotics into Florida from the Bahamas. What would happen was that there would
                    be air drops of narcotics on various islands in the Bahamas, anywhere from
                    Bimini to the East. “Cigarette” speedboats would just run into Florida at night,
                    with a load of cocaine. Aircraft were also used, of course, to smuggle drugs,
                    but speedboats were being used, more and more. We had to do something to stop
                    these boats, as they were crossing the Straits of Florida.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>By that point, in the spring of 1983, Ambassador Dobriansky had been appointed
                    and was about to arrive in Nassau. I had this 21-member Congressional delegation
                    visit us and give us the benefit of their wisdom, as well as “dump all over us.”
                    The U. S. military had acceded to the Reagan administration's desire to give us
                    more assets for our efforts. So a Special Mission Air Force unit with
                    helicopters, from Hurlburt Air Force Base in Florida, was designated to send
                    some aircraft to the Bahamas and to “set up shop.” The unit was under the
                    command of an Air Force lieutenant colonel. These aircraft were equipped for
                    night time operations. They had night vision equipment, and the personnel knew
                    how to use it. They had the latest model helicopters to do this.</p>
                <p>We moved them into the Police Academy at Oakes Field and began to run some more
                    effective operations, because we had a greater capability. I pretty much
                    directed this whole effort. I had a good relationship with two DEA agents who
                    were assigned to the Embassy. They were very accommodating and understanding.
                    However, they were essentially intelligence operatives. They really would not
                    have known how to manage this kind of operation. For example, I was the one who
                    said that we had to have rubber “fuel bladders” brought in and set up because we
                    couldn't take the chance that the “bad guys” would adulterate the fuel. We'd
                    have to have our own fuel supply, which we could test and could guard. We
                    wouldn't depend on commercial fuel. These DEA guys would not have thought of
                    that.</p>
                <p>It was my idea to move this whole operation closer in to the Embassy. Oakes Field
                    was not far from the Embassy. Think of it. If you had to run an operation, if
                    you suddenly got word that there was a “bad guy” flying up the “Slot” and you
                    had to drive all the way out to the international airport to mount up your
                    helicopters, since we didn't man these planes unless we had a target, it made a
                    lot more sense to operate from closer to the Embassy. I was able to arrange
                    that.</p>
                <p>The U. S. Air Force was very accommodating and very helpful. We found housing for
                    them. They were on “per diem” and were doing very well. I didn't get the
                    impression that the Drug Enforcement guys were resentful that I, in fact, was
                    running the “drug war” in the Bahamas because, by that point, I had been charg�
                    d'affaires for almost two years. There was no question of who was running the
                    Embassy, even though the Ambassador was just about to arrive.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>It was my thought that we needed to station one of these helicopters closer to
                    the Straits of Florida, so that we could actually “run down” these speedboats as
                    they came across. I had in mind setting up a base on Bimini Island, as well as a
                    base on this sand island, of which I spoke just now. I flew over and “made a
                    deal” with the management of the sand island that we could station some fuel
                    there so that the helicopters could refuel, if necessary. The management of the
                    sand island would arrange to guard the fuel. We didn't think that we would
                    station helicopters on the sand island, because conditions there were not very
                    good. There was a lot of blowing sand. It would really be like desert
                    operations. It was not a particularly hospitable situation. But we really didn't
                    need to station helicopters on the sand island. But we could set up on Bimini.
                    The deal that I worked out with the Royal Navy officer, who was the Commodore of
                    the Bahamian Defense Force at that time, was that we would construct a
                    helicopter pad in Bimini. He would assign a patrol boat and armed guards to
                    protect the helicopter pad, so that we could base our helicopters there. This
                    was really “Apache” [hostile] country. There were enough of the “bad guys,” so
                    that if you're going to set up a military base, you'd better be prepared to
                    guard it.</p>
                <p>Payment for fuel was a manageable problem. The Commodore had to operate his
                    forces anyway, but he didn't have money for fuel for his boats to go back and
                    forth to Nassau. So I worked out a “deal” with IN/M [in the State Department],
                    which was very helpful to me, that they would pick up the “tab” for the fuel for
                    the Commodore's Bahamian Defense Force. He would station troops there to guard
                    the helicopters. So we were all set to start operations, flying out of Bimini
                    Island and this sand island to chase down the “bad guys.”</p>
                <p>The Commander of the U. S. Coast Guard District [Seventh Coast Guard District]
                    was Rear Admiral “Deese” Thompson, who was very helpful. He had begun his
                    career, flying seaplanes like the Grumman Widgeon in the Bahamas, back in the
                    1950's. I had complained about not having the means to check out the waterways
                    in the Bahamas. He arranged to have shipped over to me in 1982, a 17-foot,
                    aluminum hulled, “buoy tender,” with a 125 HP Johnson outboard motor. It would
                    really move. So one day they towed this boat over, behind a Coast Guard cutter,
                    and said, “Here's your boat.”</p>
                <p>You could fill a volume with what I didn't know about boats. I learned “OJT” (On
                    The Job). Of course, there was no operating money whatsoever in the Embassy for
                    this boat. Some delicate inquiries were made to the ARA Executive Office, but I
                    was told that there wouldn't be any money for this purpose. So I would somehow
                    have to run this thing out of the Embassy budget. There was no money to keep
                    this boat in a marina. Since the DCM's house in Nassau was on the waterfront,
                    and I had a beach in front of the house, I just anchored the boat right there.
                    For fuel I used the budget for the automobile assigned to me. We used this boat
                    to cruise around and check on the Haitian boats which were cruising through
                    there and to keep an eye out on the “bad guys.” Now and again the marina owners
                    were very understanding and would let me keep the boat in one of their slips for
                    a couple of days.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>One evening my son and I went down to a marina to check on the boat. I was
                    walking back toward the marina office, and this Latino-looking individual,
                    carrying two large bags of groceries, was walking down to where a very large
                    “cigarette” boat was docked. The “cigarette” boats were really fast. This is the
                    kind of boat that President George Bush has.</p>
                <p>I had a Coast Guard baseball type cap on my head, which said, “U. S. Coast Guard
                    Cutter ACUSHNET” on it. I had a lot of baseball caps. It happens that the
                    ACUSHNET is a “light ship.” [It carries a light which can be seen for miles; it
                    is anchored in a relatively fixed position off the coast.] I can still remember
                    the expression on this Latino's face when he looked at me and then looked at my
                    hat with the name of the ACUSHNET on it. I smiled at him and said, “See you
                    later.” Hopefully, I ruined his evening for him.A helicopter could chase a
                    “cigarette” boat and keep an eye on it. A Coast Guard cutter could come out to
                    meet it from Florida. The cutter could stop it, but you needed a helicopter or a
                    seaplane to follow it. There was no Coast Guard ship fast enough to catch one.
                    Even a fixed wing aircraft might have a problem staying with on of these boats,
                    because they are so fast. However, a helicopter probably could follow it.</p>
                <p>There was a policy decision that we would not go out armed. We weren't going to
                    shoot at anybody, either in boats or in planes, because of considerations of
                    boating and aircraft safety and all of that. Still, the Coast Guard would be
                    prepared to shoot back at the “bad guys” if they did something stupid.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were all set up to launch the new phase of Operation BAT, which was to
                    extend operations when I was “fired.” Ambassador Dobriansky arrived in March,
                    1983. He “fired” me in June. I really thought that he was going to be a “law and
                    order” type of Republican—a conservative Republican. Our understanding had been,
                    when we had met in December, 1982, that he would let me “run” the Embassy, and
                    he was going to do whatever he wanted to do—write his memoirs or whatever...</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Or whatever. Actually, I liked him. He was a nice, old guy. Mrs.
                    Dobriansky was something else, but he wasn't a “bad sort,” actually. I thought
                    that we had a pretty good relationship. Of course, I was keeping in mind what I
                    had been told early in the game that if you're going to be charg� d'affaires for
                    a long time, don't get your hopes up about staying on. It doesn't really
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The rule of thumb is that you almost have to get rid of
                        the old DCM, because it doesn't work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You get big ego's involved, and I knew that. But operations against the
                    drug traffic seemed to be going so well. We were really beginning to build up a
                    head of steam. I had a great relationship with Vice President George Bush's
                    office and the law enforcement community. In December, 1982, after the meeting
                    in Miami, I went up to Washington to meet Ambassador Dobriansky and Assistant
                    Secretary Tom Enders and find out what the Department had in mind for me to do
                    next. Tom said, “You know, the Bahamians want you out of Nassau. Prime Minister
                    Pindling wants you out.” He said, “What do you want to do?” I said, “Well, there
                    isn't much available in the way of assignments. The only assignment available
                    would be Principal Officer in Martinique. Frankly, from what I've seen happen to
                    guys who go to Martinique, that's got to be the end of the line.” You know,
                    nobody ever goes on to anything after [serving in the Consulate in]
                    Martinique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Siberia of the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It's sort of a “golden handshake.” I had known a couple of guys who had
                    gone to Martinique. In this business and for the benefit of this exercise if you
                    don't watch what your peers and your seniors do with their careers...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have to keep an eye on their number and your
                        number.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: So I have done that over the years and I thought that there was no
                    future in the Foreign Service after serving in Martinique. I wasn't planning to
                    retire at that point. I was having a great time, running this anti-drug program.
                    I thought, “I'd just as soon stay here and give Pindling heartburn.” Enders'
                    view was, “OK, you can stay as far as I'm concerned. Pindling is not going to
                    dictate our personnel management.”</p>
                <p>So I went back to Nassau having made a commitment to the new Ambassador that my
                    basic function would be to make his mission a success. If he looked good, I
                    would look good. That's what I would work towards. I made it very clear to him
                    that he was going to be the boss. However, I had been running the Embassy and
                    knew how things worked. We had had a lot of problems. The Bahamas were
                    attracting additional attention in certain areas. I thought that the Ambassador
                    and I had an understanding. He had agreed that I would stay on as DCM for two
                    more years. But I had also seen that happen to Mike Rives in Cambodia some years
                    before. Nothing in this world is ever certain. So I returned to the Bahamas in
                    early 1983 and did my job, which seemed to be beginning to work out quite
                    successfully.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>Ambassador Dobriansky finally arrived in Nassau in early March, 1983, after many
                    “false starts.” In fact, he took over three months to arrive in Nassau. The
                    delay was becoming a very definite embarrassment. When the Governor General of
                    the Bahamas, Sir Gerald Cash, a very good friend of ours and of the United
                    States and probably the most decent person in the Bahamian Government, began to
                    complain that the new Ambassador had not yet arrived, I thought that we were in
                    trouble. I felt that I could expect Prime Minister Pindling and company to be
                    angry.</p>
                <p>By the way, Pindling had won the elections of 1982—he really “stole” them. So he
                    was all set for the next five years. I told the Ambassador that he really should
                    come down to Nassau as soon as possible, as his continued absence was becoming a
                    major political problem for the Embassy.</p>
                <p>For one reason or another Ambassador Dobriansky made one excuse after another
                    about not coming down to Nassau. Whether it was renting his house in Washington,
                    or his wife didn't want to come—whatever the problem was—he didn't arrive until
                    March, 1983.</p>
                <p>One of the great annual events in the Bahamas is what is called the Out-Island
                    Regatta, which takes place in Georgetown, in the Abaco Islands. Many of the
                    sailboats in the Bahamas get together there and have races. It happens just
                    about Easter time and is a great time for parties. Prime Minister Pindling
                    invited the Ambassador to attend the Regatta. It turns out that is when Pindling
                    “did me in.” He was able to have some “quiet” time with the Ambassador. In
                    effect, Pindling told Ambassador Dobriansky, “Look, I can work with you, but
                    Antippas has to go.” That message came across pretty clearly to me.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador did not take any action immediately. It was not until the Foreign
                    Service Inspectors came in May, 1983. We were inspected and, as I predicted
                    earlier, the “gigs” [criticisms] showed up on the administrative side. I had
                    said earlier that if I didn't have another American employee here to help out
                    [on the administrative side], how on earth could we keep our accounts clear? The
                    Inspectors came up with 48 specific criticisms of the administration of the
                    Embassy. The Ambassador used those criticisms as evidence that my management
                    techniques were a failure and, therefore, I had to go.</p>
                <p>The senior Inspector, Nancy Ostrander, who had previously served as Ambassador to
                    Suriname, spoke to me. She said, “Look, I don't know what the new Ambassador is
                    thinking about, but you've got a problem with him.” I replied, “Well, I guess
                    I'm really not surprised, under the circumstances.”</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>After the Inspectors left, the Ambassador called me into his office in early
                    June, 1983, and said, “Look, you'd better find yourself another job. I think
                    that we need to make some changes here and I need a new man. We have systemic
                    problems in the Embassy.” He loved to use words like that. He would talk in
                    large terms, like cartoon balloons. He would just “bury” you in words. You would
                    have to listen to him very carefully to understand what he was saying.</p>
                <p>I was so shocked that I didn't even clean out my personal files, as I should have
                    done, including all of the memoranda that I had written, cables, and so forth. I
                    just kind of left all of this stuff there in the Embassy in Nassau. I just
                    walked out. I was dismayed by this kind of treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a professor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: As I mentioned previously, he was a Political Science professor here at
                    Georgetown University.</p>
                <p>I was quite shocked when he “fired” me. I shouldn't have been. As it turned out,
                    Vice President Bush's former Press Secretary, Peter Teeley, happened to be in my
                    officthat day. He had just left Bush's office and was writing a book on
                    narcotics trafficking in the Caribbean. He had put in six months of research at
                    Harvard University. He had come down to Nassau to collect material for his book.
                    He happened to be sitting in my office on this particular day. My wife was also
                    there at the same time, when I walked in from my morning meeting with the
                    Ambassador. I was in a daze. I said, “You know what this guy just did? He just
                    'fired' me.” I had asked him at least to let me stay on until December, 1983, so
                    that I could get back into the assignments cycle and also because my children
                    were in school. But the Ambassador was adamant. I had to leave as soon as
                    possible. June was the worst possible time to look for an assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All assignments were in place for that year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Except when somebody “drops dead,” which is always a possibility. That
                    was my hope, so I said, “Obviously, I'd better get the hell out of Nassau.” I
                    also had in mind that the Ambassador hadn't been at post long enough to do an
                    efficiency report on me, so maybe it would be best for me to leave before the
                    Ambassador had time to do a negative efficiency report on me.</p>
                <p>A U. S. Navy sponsored meeting had been scheduled at Key West to review Emergency
                    and Evacuation [E&amp;E] procedures. I was scheduled to go, as was the
                    Administrative Officer, to prepare a plan on how we would evacuate the post,
                    should the occasion arise. This was several months before the situation in
                    Grenada became a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>I told the Ambassador that, under the circumstances, I didn't think that I ought
                    to go to the Key West meeting. I said that I should arrange to leave the post as
                    soon as possible. If I couldn't stay in Nassau, I had to find another assignment
                    in the Foreign Service. I was due for home leave at the time and actually had
                    the tickets for my family and myself.</p>
                <p>However, the Ambassador said, “No, I would really prefer that you would go to
                    this conference. You could leave in July,” or something like that. I was really
                    upset at this point, when I started thinking about it. I figured that Prime
                    Minister Pindling had “done me in,” and the Ambassador had let him get away with
                    it. As far as I could see, the Ambassador hadn't even gotten anything in
                    exchange for getting rid of me! If you're going to throw somebody to the wolves,
                    at least get something for it, like the base agreement. I had already worked out
                    a deal on the base agreement. I think I should talk about that before I discuss
                    how I was “run out of the Bahamas.”</p>
                <p>I have already said that, early in my tenure as DCM in Nassau, I had discovered
                    that we had a major problem with the Bahamian Government—particularly the
                    Foreign Minister over the base agreement because he wasn't guaranteed 10 years'
                    income for the bases. We couldn't guarantee that because of our budget
                    process.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, in 1982 I took the occasion to invite Ambassador William Middendorf, the
                    American representative to the OAS [Organization of American States], to visit
                    Nassau. He had been Ambassador to the Netherlands in the Ford Administration and
                    had been Secretary of the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes , I've interviewed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Bill Middendorf was a banker. I had met him when I was leaving for the
                    Bahamas. He had just been appointed American representative to the OAS. He said,
                    “Listen, find an excuse to invite me down to the Bahamas.” Well, I remembered
                    that. So I invited him down to the Bahamas, because it was part of my personal
                    program to invite prominent personalities down there to show that we really
                    didn't hate the Bahamas. I invited Bill down, and we talked about the base
                    agreements, because he was quite familiar with the issue from his experience in
                    the Navy. I said, “What can we do to 'sweeten the pot' a little bit or to 'sweet
                    talk' the Bahamians into accepting the base agreements?”</p>
                <p>Anyway, to make a long story short, Bill Middendorf had helped enormously to get
                    the U. S. Navy to make some accommodations to the working group which allowed us
                    to get approval to sign the base agreements. That was all “in train,” as it
                    were, at the time I was “fired” as DCM in Nassau. It was one of the things that
                    kind of “blew up” in our faces, along with all of the arrangements we were
                    making on Operation BAT.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>After I was “fired” and left Nassau, the Ambassador decided to have a “chat” with
                    NBC [National Broadcasting Company] television. NBC was in the process of doing
                    an expose on the “cocaine connection” in the Bahamas. The Ambassador made these
                    arrangements on his own hook, without telling Washington and without having the
                    Public Affairs Officer or anybody else in the Embassy help him or protect him.
                    He talked for three hours on videotape with Bryan Ross of NBC. He said some
                    outlandish things, which NBC, of course, showed on television on the day after
                    Labor Day, 1983. The Ambassador told Ross, “Law enforcement isn't the only issue
                    that we have in the Bahamas. We have this base agreement which is still
                    pending.” That was absolutely the wrong thing to say. It blew everything out of
                    the water. It was almost hilarious if it had not been so stupid. It was a prime
                    demonstration of how political appointees can be their own worst enemies. The
                    Ambassador almost got himself “fired” because of this thing. I think that he was
                    very close to being forced to resign by the White House, except that Presidents
                    don't like to do that sort of thing.The NBC expose, which was called, “The Vesco
                    Connection in the Bahamas,” alleged that the Bahamian Government was being “paid
                    off” by Robert Vesco on behalf of the Colombian drug cartel to let them use
                    Norman's Cay, which I mentioned earlier. The television program stated that
                    there were drug airplanes flying out of Norman's Cay into Florida and that the
                    original “connection” had been Robert Vesco, who had allegedly funded the
                    initial Colombian operation in the late 1970's. The program was apparently based
                    on “leaks,” probably out of the State of Florida law enforcement community. I
                    don't think that the “leaks” came from the federal law enforcement community. I
                    think that it sounded like what the Sheriff of Broward County had said to me.
                    The Sheriff had told me that Robert Vesco had been “paying off” Prime Minister
                    Pindling and company. Vesco was allegedly also in “cahoots” with the Colombian
                    drug cartel.</p>
                <p>On the day before the NBC television program on the Bahamas was aired, my friend
                    Kenny Cartwright, from the Bahamas, called me in Boston where I was visiting my
                    brother. Kenny was still in Nassau. He said, “Watch NBC tomorrow morning. On the
                    NBC 'Today' show there's going to be an expose on the Bahamas. I've got a
                    problem because they're going to mention my name as being involved in narcotics
                    trafficking.” He asked, “What can I do to protect myself?” He said that Glenn
                    Campbell, who was the DEA agent in Nassau, “knows very well that I am not
                    involved. I knew that myself. It's going to be very bad if my name is mentioned.
                    It can ruin me.” I advised him to send a telegram to the chief of the DEA office
                    in Miami, whose name escapes me now, indicating that this NBC show was about to
                    be televised. I advised him to tell the DEA chief that he absolutely denies any
                    involvement in drug trafficking and that he is willing to take a polygraph [”lie
                    detector”] test to prove his point. I said, “I suggest that you send a copy of
                    that telegram to NBC immediately, showing that you have done this. That may
                    dissuade them from mentioning your name.” However, in any event, Kenny
                    Cartwright's name was mentioned prominently.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>On the next morning, at 7:00 or 8:00 AM, this segment showed up on television
                    with Bryan Ross questioning Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas. It was sort
                    of “in your face” journalism. He had walked up to Pindling in the street in
                    Nassau, pushed his microphone on his face, and said, “Are you being 'paid off'
                    by the Colombians?” I thought, “Boy, am I glad that I'm not in Nassau.”</p>
                <p>This telecast caused a political “firestorm” in the Bahamas. In statements to the
                    press and in speeches at political rallies, Prime Minister Pindling started to
                    blame me for the allegations made in the telecast. He said, “This is all because
                    of “Antippas”. “Antippas leaked this material to NBC because he was angry that
                    he was not made Ambassador to the Bahamas”. When Ambassador Dobriansky came to
                    Nassau, he 'fired' Antippas.” In fact, Dobriansky “fired” me because Pindling
                    had told him to “fire” me. So on and on it went. It became more and more a
                    matter of allegations like that. Pindling appeared on the NBC “Today” show with
                    Jane Pauley and Bryan Ross. It was a very acerbic, frigid kind of session. I
                    have video tapes of these interviews some place in my files.</p>
                <p>U. S. Government policy was that we didn't want to create any problems with the
                    Bahamas. This had been my own instinct. I felt that it doesn't serve any purpose
                    to pick a fight with the Bahamian Government. It would just give them an excuse
                    not to cooperate with us. In fact, that is what I told Bryan Ross, when ran me
                    to ground later on in Grenada. At first I refused to talk to him. Then I agreed
                    to. I told him, “Look, I may be very sympathetic with what you're trying to
                    do—your motives and all that. I certainly agree that a number of figures in the
                    Bahamian Government are as corrupt as the day is long. I also think that some of
                    the things you reported in that story were not right—the references to 'air
                    conditioned hangars full of cocaine,' and all of that stuff. If I had been in
                    charge of the Embassy when you came to Nassau, in July, 1983, you would not have
                    gotten in the door. Not only would I not have talked to you, I wouldn't even
                    have let you in the Embassy, because it was not my job, as a representative of
                    the United States, to cause an uproar in our relationships with the Bahamas and
                    give some of the leaders of the Bahamian Government an excuse not to cooperate
                    with us,” which is what happened. They stopped cooperating on the drug side and
                    they also stalled the signature of the base agreement for another year before
                    they finally sat down and signed it.</p>
                <p>I had gotten to know Kenny Cartwright earlier during my stay in Nassau. He was a
                    white businessman who was doing very well. He owned car dealerships and
                    property. Later on I rented a house from him which my family lived in.
                    Initially, I looked at Kenny Cartwright with something of a jaundiced eye. I had
                    gotten to know him because our wives were in the same bridge group. Kenny's wife
                    was of Colombian background and had been married to Kenny for some years. We met
                    these people socially. My wife was telling me about his wife. I thought that I
                    should stay away from these people because he had the absolutely classic profile
                    of somebody involved in drugs.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>But I was wrong, actually. He was simply very much a hard charging, Bahamian
                    businessman who knew how to make a buck. As Nassau was a very small community,
                    he had gotten to know a lot of people. One of the things that he had done was
                    that he had either sold or rented property to Robert Vesco in the Abaco Islands.
                    I think that he either sold Vesco a house or a half interest in an island there,
                    which, of course, was suspect in some people's minds. I asked DEA to run a
                    “whole name check” on him before I started seeing this guy socially. We got to
                    know each other. He had a couple of yachts.</p>
                <p>On Easter weekend, 1983, we took our families and went down to inspect Norman's
                    Cay, which, by that time, had been abandoned by the Colombian cartel, as a
                    result of the pressure that we had put on them the previous year through Vice
                    President George Bush. I had been able to arrange for a surveillance of the
                    island by an AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System] aircraft. The Vice
                    President was able to hand Prime Minister Pindling the substance of this
                    surveillance at their meeting in Miami in December, 1982. He insisted that
                    Pindling had to cooperate with the United States. I think that Pindling got the
                    word to the Colombians that they had to leave Norman's Cay, and they left. They
                    just walked out, leaving groceries sitting right on the table. I found open
                    bottles of Ketchup sitting on tables there in the houses which I inspected.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I didn't advertise my presence there. We went down to Norman's Cay with
                    an American doctor who lived on the island part of the time. We inspected every
                    house—some 20 of them—on the island. I found evidence—drug
                    paraphernalia—including boxes with the leaflets which the Colombians had dropped
                    on the 1982 Bahamian independence day parade in Nassau. These leaflets said,
                    “Nixon, Reagan, DEA—Go Home! The Bahamas for the Bahamians!” They had stapled
                    money to some of these leaflets, which they also dropped on Bimini and on Grand
                    Bahama Islands. They had Bahamian $100, $50, $20, and $10 bills—which are equal
                    to U. S. dollars—stapled to these leaflets. I learned from a grocer in Bimini
                    Island later on that people came in to buy groceries with the money still
                    stapled to the leaflets. The drug traffickers apparently just tossed these boxes
                    of leaflets out of the plane door. One of the boxes apparently hit the
                    [horizontal] stabilizer, damaging the aircraft so that they had to land. The
                    Bahamian police knew who carried out this operation, and they arrested the
                    Bahamian pilot. I also found plastic envelopes in which the Colombians packed
                    cocaine. I found a duffle bag—not a military regulation size bag but a smaller
                    size used in packing cocaine. I found a number of pistol holsters and a set of
                    Sears Roebuck golf clubs which were cut off so that the heads of the clubs were
                    sticking out of the bag. The bottom part of the bag was empty so that you could
                    load things into it—drugs or money or whatever.</p>
                <p>I took all of this stuff with me, along with bags full of telephone receipts from
                    the office of the yacht marina, which had been “trashed.” The receipts recorded
                    phone calls from Norman's Cay to Florida, Georgia, and other places. The whole
                    island was “trashed.” There was nobody there. Boaters would come and look
                    around, but there was nobody living on the island at that time.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>We took this stuff onto the boat and hid it in the bilges so that the police
                    wouldn't see it immediately if they stopped us. I laid out this material in my
                    office on the following Monday and asked the Ambassador to come and see what I
                    had brought back from Norman's Cay. I must say that I was somewhat surprised at
                    his “low key” response. He was not impressed with any of this stuff, which
                    showed the massive use of Norman's Cay by the Colombians.</p>
                <p>I called DEA Intelligence in Miami and told them that I had all of this evidence
                    and asked them to send someone to come over and look at it. They could look at
                    it, but they would have to leave it here, because I was afraid that it might
                    “disappear” if they took it over to Miami. I kept this material in the Embassy
                    vault. This subject came up later, in 1988, when I had to testify in
                    Jacksonville, FL, against Medellin Cartel founder Carlos Enrique Rivas “Joe”
                    Lehder, for the U. S. Prosecutor, when I described what I had done with all of
                    this evidence.</p>
                <p>My family had returned to the Bahamas in August before the NBC expose. I had
                    arranged this with my wife, since the kids were already in school. We didn't
                    want to go back to Washington, just having come from there. We agreed that I
                    would try to find another appropriate overseas assignment and would “camp out”
                    in Washington with friends. She would stay in Nassau. If I didn't land another
                    overseas assignment by Christmas, we would “bite the bullet,” kick the tenant
                    out of our home in Washington, and settle down there. That probably would have
                    been the smartest thing for me to have done, from a professional point of view.
                    I probably should have stayed in Washington at that time.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I made this arrangement with my wife. She went back to Nassau. We rented
                    a small house from our friend, Kenny Cartwright. I moved out of the DCM's
                    residence and moved the family into this small house. I went back to Washington
                    and took a trip, visiting friends in New England. I was “working the telephones”
                    a lot, trying to find an assignment. The DCM job in Athens was opening up. I
                    tried to get the Principal Officer's job in Bermuda. The Ambassador in Barbados
                    asked me if I'd like to be DCM down there, because I had gotten to know him. I
                    agreed. Unfortunately, the Ambassador had turned in his own resignation, so the
                    personnel system decided not to go through with this assignment, as ARA had its
                    own candidate for the DCM slot in Barbados. Nothing was really working out. The
                    Executive Director of ARA said, “Well, you can't hang around Washington doing
                    nothing. I'm going to make you Deputy Director of Mexican Affairs.” I said,
                    “Well, that will be interesting, because I've never been in Mexico and I don't
                    speak Spanish. I should bring a whole, new perspective to our relationship.”</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>This was at the time when John Gavin, the actor, was the Ambassador to Mexico,
                    and, I think, George High was the Country Director for Mexico—a very decent guy
                    and a very competent officer. But the one thing I remember from the two months
                    or so that I spent in Mexican Affairs was that, basically, the “desk” wasn't
                    running anything. Ambassador John Gavin was running our policy toward Mexico,
                    given his close connections with President Reagan. Gavin was running things “his
                    way” and was breaking all sorts of crockery in the process. He put a relatively
                    junior officer in as Mission Coordinator, more or less bypassing the DCM. It was
                    a little tough for a career guy to swallow to see how the “pecking order” in the
                    Embassy in Mexico was being disjointed. The one time that I met Ambassador
                    Gavin, I found him to be very personable, charming, and all that. I immediately
                    thought of the movie, “Psycho,” which he had starred in back in the 1960's.
                    However, I didn't find working on Mexican affairs very satisfactory under all of
                    these circumstances.</p>
                <p>Around Labor Day in 1983, before I went to work on the Mexican Desk, I went back
                    to Boston to visit family members and went up to Vermont to visit Jim Engel, a
                    former Ambassador and friend of mine, who had served in Cambodia with me and
                    then went off to be Ambassador to Benin, in West Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He lived in Peacham, Vermont. I interviewed him up
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I went up to spend that weekend with him and then went over to York
                    Beach, in Maine, to see another friend. Jim and I had been good friends. I had
                    known him in Vietnam. He had asked me to be his DCM [in Benin] at that time,
                    when I was on the Cambodian desk. It didn't happen because Jim White, who had
                    come out of Benin and was later Ambassador to Morocco, I think, had appointed a
                    new DCM in Benin. Again, this is the kind of thing that you're not supposed to
                    do, in the great scheme of things. You normally let the new Ambassador appoint
                    his own DCM. I remember that Ambassador Jim Engle was a little irritated by
                    that. I've often thought of how different my career would have been had I taken
                    that job in Benin, because, as it turned out, the guy who went out as DCM for
                    Jim Engle remained as charg� d'affaires for a good part of his tour there,
                    because Jim pulled himself out.</p>
                <p>Maybe I should back up a bit and tell another story, because it is indicative of
                    the trouble you can get into as a charg� d'affaires, if you're not careful. On
                    July 4, 1982, as was the custom in the Bahamas, none of the members of the
                    Bahamian cabinet came to our reception. The Governor General came, representing
                    the Bahamas, but not one cabinet member—not even the Foreign Minister. Can you
                    believe that? With only three resident diplomatic missions in the Bahamas the
                    Foreign Minister couldn't find time to attend. Obviously, it was a deliberate
                    snub of the United States. I was furious, fit to be tied, and very angry at this
                    kind of treatment.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>The Bahamian Independence Day celebration is on July 10. We had a staff meeting
                    at the Embassy, and I decided that, under the circumstances, we couldn't fail to
                    show up at the Bahamian reception. However, they had sent us 10 tickets to the
                    grandstand, where all of the VIP's [Very Important Persons] and the Diplomatic
                    Corps were seated. The way the system worked was that you drove up in your car
                    in front of the grandstand, got out of your car, walked up to the grandstand,
                    and sat down. This was all done in front of everybody. So I thought, “Screw
                    these bastards! I'm going to send the most junior guy in the Embassy in our
                    smallest car. He will sit alone in the middle of this 10-seat section.”</p>
                <p>My friend, John Upston, the Caribbean Coordinator in ARA, happened to be visited
                    the Bahamas at that particular time. He sat in on this staff meeting. Remember,
                    this guy is a political appointee but had been around Washington for a long
                    time. He said, “Don't do that. It'll never be understood. These guys will
                    complain to Washington, and you'll look bad. You've got to go.” As I thought
                    about it, I thought, “Whom am I going to be hurting? I'll be hurting the
                    Governor General,” who, in fact, is the man who presides over the independence
                    day celebration as the representative of the Queen of England. I would be
                    insulting him. So I swallowed my pride, and the whole Embassy staff attended
                    this celebration.</p>
                <p>The festivities were held in a park near Ft. Montague, which the American Marines
                    took in 1777, during the Revolutionary War seizing all of the gun powder there.
                    The USS NASSAU, a Marine Landing Ship, is named after this event. When we were
                    getting ready to leave the grandstand at the end of the celebration, out of the
                    corner of my eye I saw some papers fluttering over in a corner of the field. At
                    first I thought it was garbage blowing in the wind.I was about to get in my car
                    when a journalist came up to me and showed me this leaflet. He said, “What do
                    you think of this?” This was the leaflet I mentioned before. I did a double take
                    when I looked at this thing which said “Nixon-Reagans DEA leave the Bahamas for
                    the Bahamians”. A plane had just dropped these over the city, aiming for the
                    independence day celebration. You often reflect on what you should have said in
                    such a circumstance. Anyhow, I said, “Well, I don't think that the Bahamian
                    Government shares that feeling,” or something like that. After I had given the
                    matter some thought, what I should have said to this journalist was, “We must be
                    doing something right if they would do something so stupid as to drop leaflets
                    on the Bahamas independence celebration!!” It didn't take a genius to figure out
                    who had done this. It was the Colombian drug cartel.</p>
                <p>In fact, as I was talking to this journalist, I saw that somebody was showing
                    another leaflet to the Foreign Minister, who was down in front of us, several
                    rows away. He was laughing uproariously. Later on, those leaflets became a prize
                    possession in the DEA office in Miami—they even made Xerox copies of them. It
                    was almost like a badge of honor.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>In July, 1983, my family and I were in the U. S. on home leave, before Judy and
                    the kids went back to Nassau. I was trying to sell a house, having a medical
                    exam, and so forth. As I mentioned before, July 10 is the date of the
                    independence day celebration of the Bahamas. I had a good relationship with the
                    Bahamian Ambassador to the United States here in Washington, Reginald Wood. He
                    had been permanent Secretary in the Bahamian Finance Ministry before being
                    appointed Ambassador. Kenny Cartwright and his family came up to the U. S. for a
                    vacation and to look at schools. They were putting their daughters into school
                    in Baltimore. We got together, as friends do. I said, “Look, I'm invited to the
                    Bahamian independence day celebration at the Embassy.” I told Cartwright, “Why
                    don't you come along? It's your Embassy, your celebration. Let's go and have a
                    drink on the Bahamas.” So we did, and everything was friendly.</p>
                <p>Well, it turned out that the Bahamian Ambassador reported back to Nassau that
                    Antippas had turned up at the Embassy reception on Bahamian independence day
                    with Kenny Cartwright. Unbeknownst to me, Kenny was probably already in “bad
                    odor” with Prime Minister Pindling. It was apparently known that Kenny had taken
                    me down to Norman's Cay to investigate the island. I wasn't sure whether this
                    was known to Pindling or not. If so, Kenny would be in “hot water” with
                    Pindling. Of course, Pindling could be vindictive. He knew how to hurt
                    people.</p>
                <p>When Kenny Cartwright's name was mentioned on the NBC “Today” show, Pindling
                    said, “Well, you know Kenny Cartwright,” implying that Kenny was part of the
                    problem. The fuss that took place because of the “Today” show caused a real
                    problem in Washington. Admiral Murphy, Vice President Bush's chief of staff,
                    later appeared on the “Today” show to talk to the NBC people about the
                    implications of this. Of course, he tried to smooth it over.</p>
                <p>When I met Bryan Ross of NBC later on in Grenada, I told him that I had been
                    subpoenaed before the Congressional Task Force on Narcotics of which
                    Representative Glen English, of Ohio, was chairman. English had summoned me to
                    testify about what I had done in the Bahamas and what was going on there. I said
                    that I would testify but I stipulated that it would have to be in Executive
                    Session. I explained to the Committee staff that my family was still in Nassau
                    and that it might endanger them if my testimony were reported. They agreed to
                    that, and I did testify in Executive Session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: May I ask you a question. Here you were, a serving Foreign
                        Service Officer and you're asked to testify before a Congressional
                        Committee. How does this work? Does the Department of State give you any
                        instructions or anything like that? What did the Department do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The Department of State did nothing.I wrote out my statement,
                    describing what I had tried to do in the Bahamas and the efforts I made to bring
                    resources to play and get the Bahamian Government to cooperate, to shut down the
                    Colombian cartel activities on Norman's Cay, and so forth. I didn't show this
                    statement to anybody in the Department. Nobody asked to see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they knew that you were going to testify before this
                        Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The Department knew that I was going to testify. I think that everybody
                    was thinking, “Let Antippas go out and hang himself.” I think that they expected
                    me to go up there and fall flat on my face. One of the reasons that I was so
                    shocked for being “fired” by Ambassador Dobriansky in the Bahamas was that I had
                    done, I think, quite a good job, and I had a pretty good reputation with people
                    in Congress. In my statement, I made it clear that I had left Nassau
                    unwillingly, but I had left. Statements made on NBC certainly didn't reflect my
                    feelings. I felt that we should be doing as much as we can to interdict the flow
                    of narcotics into the United States from the Bahamas. I've looked at my
                    statement several times since then, as I still have copies of it. I could have
                    done it better, but this was prepared in a hurry. I made it CONFIDENTIAL because
                    my family was still down in Nassau. I think that I came out of those hearings,
                    “smelling like a rose.” I was complimented and was certainly not hurt by
                    that.</p>
                <p>It turned out that video coverage of me coming out of the Committee hearings was
                    shown on TV in Nassau. This drove Prime Minister Pindling and the Foreign
                    Minister “up the wall.” They probably knew exactly what I was saying, even
                    though none of my testimony was published. It was not “leaked,” and its
                    confidentiality was kept.</p>
                <p>I had left Nassau in fairly good odor. I wasn't in trouble when I left. I just
                    left—no press conference, no reporters, no nothing. I only told the Police Chief
                    and the Governor General why I was leaving. I said, “I'm going to leave my
                    family here. I'd like you to keep an eye on them. I'm just leaving. I'm not
                    saying anything. It isn't in my place to say anything. The Ambassador has the
                    right to choose whomever he wants as his deputy. That's it.” And I was gone in a
                    week. Of course, I came back to Nassau in August, 1983, to settle up my house
                    and move out of the DCM residence, but I left quietly.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>After it became known that I had testified before the Congressional Task Force on
                    Narcotics, Prime Minister Pindling realized that my family was still in the
                    Bahamas. At first I did not know how he found out. However, Ambassador
                    Dobriansky was sending telegrams to the Department, not only to ARA but to “M”
                    [Management], claiming that I was the “leak,” that I was the “problem,” and that
                    I was causing political problems for the Embassy in Nassau because of my
                    activities. I am not sure of exactly what he alleged, because I only saw some of
                    his statements. The Ambassador was in trouble with the White House because he
                    had compromised the narcotics campaign. The Bahamians were making it very clear
                    that the NBC television program angered them and were beginning to drag their
                    feet on law enforcement cooperation with us. In fact, the Ambassador was the
                    source of the public affairs problem for the Embassy by his talking to NBC. He
                    had really done the dumbest thing of all, which was to open up this “Pandora's
                    Box.” I wasn't in the Bahamas. I could truthfully say that I didn't know a thing
                    about the NBC program on the Bahamas until I saw it myself on the day after
                    Labor Day, 1983.</p>
                <p>To show you what a fool Ambassador Dobriansky was—and I mean a fool—I have a copy
                    of a SECRET EXDIS [Exclusive Distribution in the Department of State] cable in
                    which he discussed this whole issue with the Under Secretary for Management. I
                    was still in ARA and was able to go down to the Caribbean desk and see the cable
                    traffic. In one of these telegrams the Ambassador took various “potshots” at me.
                    But one of the things that he admitted in the cable was that he told Prime
                    Minister Pindling that my family was still in the Bahamas. And he told him where
                    my family was in the Bahamas—of course, breaching my family's and my rights of
                    privacy. This was one of the decisions which one has to consider about what to
                    do about something like that. My first inclination was to raise “holy hell” and
                    bring a lawsuit against Ambassador Dobriansky for doing this. But obviously this
                    would not please the White House and would compromise my family's privacy. They
                    were in Nassau as private citizens, and not as the dependents of a U. S.
                    Government employee. They had moved out of the DCM residence and were in private
                    quarters.</p>
                <p>When Prime Minister Pindling discovered where my family was, the next thing I
                    knew was that my wife was being summoned to the Bahamian Immigration Department
                    to justify her presence in the Bahamas. They started harassing her. I wasn't
                    worried about their physical security, although the house was robbed once. We
                    think that it was the Haitian gardener who did that. The Pindling government
                    forced my wife to leave the Bahamas on two occasions to reapply for visas. My
                    children were half scared to death with agents coming to the house. It was about
                    the time that our pet dog was run over in front of the house. The kids were
                    really concerned. My wife was verbally “abused” by the Bahamian Director of
                    Immigration, who was the sister of the Deputy Prime Minister. In 1982 I had
                    helped this woman's son get a scholarship to The Oral Roberts University in
                    Oklahoma. They are all interrelated there. It's amazing how quickly things turn
                    around.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>My wife called the Embassy for assistance, but Ambassador Dobriansky refused to
                    provide any consular assistance to help her in her problems with Bahamian
                    Immigration. It ended up that it cost me $1,000 for my wife and $50 for each
                    child to let them stay in Nassau until Christmas.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Dobriansky continued to send “zingers” to the Department against me.
                    It shows you how “dumb” the Ambassador is. I held off doing anything about all
                    of this, because taking on an Ambassador at his post abroad doesn't do anybody's
                    career any good. Fortunately, a very good friend of mine in the Office of the
                    Legal Adviser who handled Latin American affairs sent an instruction to the
                    Embassy in Nassau, telling the Ambassador to stop criticizing me, since I was no
                    longer in the Bahamas, and instructing the Embassy to assist my wife in her
                    dealings with the Bahamian Immigration Department. The Department saw that the
                    Embassy was getting out on a limb by not providing my wife with appropriate
                    assistance. That took a little of the “heat” off my wife. Of course, our mutual
                    friend Richard Morefield, who had accepted the post of Consul General in Tehran
                    after I had turned it down and who became a hostage when the Embassy was taken
                    over in 1979, was in charge of the Office of Caribbean Affairs at the time. He
                    kept telling me, “Get your family out of the Bahamas. You can't tell what might
                    happen. This is too dangerous.” I discounted the danger. I didn't really think
                    that they were in any danger. Harassed, yes. I didn't feel that the Bahamian
                    authorities would be “dumb enough” to harm my family.</p>
                <p>The Ambassador was going after me in a pretty hot and heavy way when the
                    Department told the Ambassador to “lay off.” He was in enough trouble as it was
                    without trying to blame someone else for his obviously patent stupidity. One of
                    the things that he had not known—and he had not given me a chance to discuss
                    this point before I left Nassau—was that I had asked the Director of the Federal
                    Task Force on Narcotics in Miami for a letter to the Department describing my
                    assistance to the Task Force. I said to the Director, “I'm the charg� d'affaires
                    in the Bahamas. One of the problems of a guy in my position is that nobody knows
                    what I do here. I don't have very many supervisors. I've got a boss in
                    Washington, but he's there. It's always helpful for people who deal with and
                    work with me to send some kind of memo into the “system” to indicate what I have
                    done. So if you think that I have been of any use to you guys here in Florida, I
                    wish that you'd tell somebody about it.” I left it at that.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>It turned out that he had a letter drafted, praising me “to the skies” for the
                    collaboration which I had provided to the Task Force when I was charg�
                    d'affaires in Nassau. He sent it up to Admiral Murphy, the chief of staff of the
                    Office of the Vice President, to sign. Murphy decided to give it to Vice
                    President Bush to sign. Bush sent the letter to Secretary of State George
                    Shultz. In May, 1983, when I was having some problems with the Foreign Service
                    Inspectors, I received a “back channel” copy of Bush's letter to Shultz. Before
                    I had a chance to show it to Ambassador Dobriansky, he “fired” me. So the
                    Ambassador never saw this letter. Of course, I was naive enough at that time to
                    think that this might make a difference. I thought that the Vice President might
                    call the Ambassador and ask him, “What do you think you're doing, 'firing'
                    Antippas?” But the system doesn't work that way. The Vice President isn't about
                    to get involved in anything dealing with the White House. This is something that
                    any Foreign Service Officer who aspires to do anything must understand. The Vice
                    President's staff and the White House staff are really very much in a
                    confrontational situation. Very seldom do those two staffs cooperate.</p>
                <p>In fact, Admiral Murphy, who is now my “boss” in the consulting firm I work for,
                    has talked about this issue with me on a number of occasions. He was talking
                    about former Secretary of State James Baker, when Baker was President Reagan's
                    chief of staff during the first Reagan term of office. However, Baker had been
                    suggested to President Reagan by Vice President Bush. Baker was a Bush supporter
                    when he became chief of staff of the White House. Admiral Murphy was saying to
                    me the other day, “You know, Baker never did a thing for us [in the Office of
                    the Vice President]. He never gave us any extra office space or 'goodies.' The
                    confrontation was always there.” This tendency had probably been underlined when
                    Lyndon Johnson was Vice President and was “dumped on” by the Kennedy White House
                    staff. Or when Vice President Ford became President. The White House can be a
                    real “shark tank.” So don't be naive and think that, because you have some
                    relationship with the Office of the Vice President, this is necessarily going to
                    do anything for you in the White House.</p>
                <p>Obviously, this unsolicited letter from Vice President George Bush was useful to
                    me. By the way, I had to “find” the letter. It had gone astray. I was prudent
                    enough, when I returned to the Department from Nassau, to ask Personnel where
                    this letter was. It wasn't in my file. They found the letter somewhere and put
                    it in my file. In mid-October, 1983, I was promoted to be a member of the Senior
                    Foreign Service, which was very satisfying. I thought that this was the result
                    of the letter which Vice President Bush had written to Secretary of State Shultz
                    regarding the assistance I had given to the South Florida Task Force on
                    Narcotics. If I hadn't found this letter and had it put in my file, I probably
                    wouldn't have been promoted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is probably a good point to stop. We'll pick up at
                        the point where you're back in Washington, looking for a new job, in the

                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 12, 1994. Andy, we're back in the summer
                        of 1983, and you're “on the beach,” as it were. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I can't remember how we left it, but I had been suddenly “unhorsed” in
                    the Bahamas—very unexpectedly and shockingly. I was out of “synch” with the
                    Foreign Service assignments cycle. I left the Bahamas in June, 1983, to come
                    back to Washington and look for a job in the Foreign Service. I knew that I
                    couldn't afford to waste any time in doing that, especially at that level. After
                    my two years as charg� d'affaires and chief of mission, I was really in a
                    special category. I knew that openings would come up. People drop dead, break
                    legs, and do all sorts of things like that. You never know when a job might be
                    opening up. I came back to Washington to “politic” for a job that might get us
                    back overseas again. As I said before, pending some other assignment, my wife
                    and kids went back to the Bahamas, because the kids were already in school,
                    rather than returning to Washington and throwing the tenants out of our
                    house.</p>
                <p>My best friend in ARA was the Executive Director of the Bureau. He had been a
                    very staunch supporter of mine. For a guy like myself, who had no background in
                    ARA, to have one of the key officials in the Bureau on my side was really
                    worthwhile. You really needed friends in high places. You can't understand the
                    Foreign Service if you don't understand this matter of “belonging” to a given
                    Bureau. I understood this very well and had been surprised when I got the job as
                    DCM in the Bahamas in the first place.</p>
                <p>I think that one of the things that led to my “downfall” was the fact that Tom
                    Enders, the Assistant Secretary for ARA, was relieved from his assignment as a
                    result of his fight with the White House over policy toward El Salvador. He had
                    crossed swords with Judge Clark, the Special Assistant to the President for
                    National Security Affairs, and who knows who else? Tom Enders wasn't “liked” by
                    people like Senator Jesse Helms [Republican, North Carolina] and others because
                    he had been regarded as too close to former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
                    Tom was replaced in ARA. I couldn't get back in time. The timing was just a
                    little bit “off” for me to get to know the new Assistant Secretary for ARA Tony
                    Motley, who replaced Tom Enders.</p>
                <p>Although Tom tried to help me do that, I found that, by the time I got back into
                    the Bureau of American Republic Affairs, I was being “stiffed” [kept at arm's
                    length] by the people around the new Assistant Secretary. Some of these people
                    were my colleagues and people that I knew. They were keeping me from getting in
                    to see the new Assistant Secretary to plead for another assignment. This was a
                    message to me that I had become “notorious.” I probably had “frosted” or “ticked
                    off” someone. Maybe it was just the ARA “crowd” making sure that a non-ARA guy
                    would not walk off with a “plum.” But I kept working at getting another
                    assignment overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>Then the Grenada affair happened. I decided that, as I knew how these things
                    worked and as I had been deeply involved in similar circumstances in Cambodia, I
                    would volunteer to go. I thought that I would do anything to get out of
                    Washington and get out of the job on the Mexican desk for which I was really not
                    suited. Who knows? Maybe there would be an overseas assignment as a result of
                    this job. All kinds of dynamics are set in motion when events like this take
                    place. I had experienced this kind of thing before and I had some knowledge of
                    what was happening in Grenada because I had watched this situation develop while
                    I was in the Bahamas, particularly as concern developed about the ultra-Left
                    wing takeover in 1979 in Grenada. The fact that the Cubans were doing things in
                    Grenada raised the question of whether missiles were being emplaced there. Then
                    there was the whole business about an airfield being built in Grenada. As nearly
                    anybody could tell you, this airfield was probably intended to provide a landing
                    place for flights going to Angola in support of the Cuban expeditionary force in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>So I volunteered to go. I went up to the Grenada task force and said, “Look,
                    you're going to need help down there. I know something about running embassies.
                    I'll be happy to go.” My offer was accepted, and I went to the house owned by
                    the people I was staying with, packed, said goodbye, and left the next day. In
                    Barbados, just before I reached Grenada, other troops were coming in. The
                    American forces had already landed in Grenada and had cleared the airfield
                    [which had not yet been completed]. I actually arrived in Grenada with the
                    various prime ministers of the Eastern Caribbean area, including Prime Minister
                    Edward Seaga of Jamaica, when they made their first visit. That started that
                    part of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me what the situation was and what you were
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The whole intervention was very unstructured. The 82nd Airborne
                    Division from Ft. Bragg was already in place by the time I arrived. The initial
                    combat was handled by U.S. Army Rangers and by Special Forces field teams which
                    had gone into Grenada to rescue American medical students who were there and
                    also to rescue the Governor General. After the murder of Prime Minister Bishop
                    and his associates by the Ultra-Leftists it was felt that we had to rescue the
                    Governor General because he was the “link with legitimacy,” as the
                    representative of the British Crown and as the link with the constitution. Navy
                    “Seal” teams went into Grenada to protect the Governor General. Though he was
                    not evacuated, some of the heaviest fighting took place, protecting him at his
                    residence.</p>
                <p>I got to know him a little bit because we worked quite closely with the Governor
                    General during the period when I was acting DCM and charg� d'affaires in
                    Grenada. The U. S. representative on the ground was Charles “Tony” Gillespie, a
                    classmate of mine at the National War College and an old ARA hand in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>It is interesting to recall that Gillespie had accepted the job that Tom Enders
                    had originally offered me in 1981 to be his assistant in the Bureau of American
                    Republic Affairs. Gillespie was a much more skilled bureaucratic “in-fighter”
                    than I would ever be. He did very well by himself in Grenada. I think that he
                    was the one who made sure that I didn't get to meet the new Assistant Secretary
                    of ARA who replaced Tom Enders. Gillespie came out of the reshuffle of the
                    Enders “front office” as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the
                    Caribbean. While Enders had tried to limit the number of Deputy Assistant
                    Secretaries in the Bureau by not creating a Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Caribbean Affairs, Gillespie came out of this whole affair in that position.
                    Gillespie was traveling in the area at the time the events in Grenada took
                    place, so he was “on the ground,” as it were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 8, Side A, of the interview with Andy
                        Antippas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Since Charles Gillespie was “on the ground,” he was put in charge of U.
                    S. efforts on the civilian side in Grenada.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Bridgetown, Barbados, I went directly to Gillespie and told him
                    that I was there to help. Anything that he needed to do, I would do it. We
                    weren't particularly friends. We were just acquaintances from the National War
                    College and from the two years I spent in the Bureau of ARA and in Nassau. You
                    may recall that when I first went to the Bahamas, the seven-nation conference on
                    the Caribbean Basin Initiative had taken place. I had “put the arm on the
                    Bureau” to make sure that Secretary of State Haig found some time to meet with
                    Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas. In arranging this I had talked to
                    Charles Gillespie and told him that he simply had to “make this happen.” We
                    could not let the American Secretary of State come to Nassau and use the
                    Bahamian conference hall and not talk to the leader of the government which
                    owned the hall. However, I had really not had an awful lot to do with Gillespie
                    after that. He was an old ARA hand, of course. He spoke Spanish and was an
                    officer from the administrative “cone.” I think that he was a competent enough
                    guy and was clearly the senior man on the ground on the civilian side in
                    Grenada. I had no problem with that.</p>
                <p>We flew over to Grenada in a C-130 transport aircraft. When we arrived in
                    Grenada, we tried to “set up shop.” We were basically operating with satellite
                    radios—I forget what the designation was. You have a satellite “dish” and can
                    talk to anybody you want to talk with. Your hand got a little tired, holding
                    down the “butterfly” [transmit] switch, if you were talking to the Operations
                    Center in the Department.</p>
                <p>We moved from the airport to the outskirts of Georgetown, Grenada, while the area
                    was being cleared, on the very first day that we were there. Two things happened
                    that I got involved with during that first day.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>We had learned, through “SIGINT” that the Libyans had received instructions to
                    kidnap an American and hold him as hostage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “SIGINT” is “Signals Intelligence.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: So it was decided that we had better “lock up” the Libyans in their
                    compound. There was a junior Foreign Service Officer, whose name escapes me
                    now...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Larry Rosen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: No. I can picture him now, but he was one of the few people in the
                    world who had ever been on Grenada. I think that this was because he was a
                    vice-consul somewhere else and had to go to Grenada to do consular work. So he
                    more or less knew where some of these places were. He knew where the Libyan
                    Embassy was. I was told to take a vehicle and go back down to the airport and
                    secure the cooperation of the U. S. military in lending us two or three squads
                    of infantry to supply the firepower needed to secure the Libyan Embassy. Others
                    would go off and try to locate the Libyan Embassy and see what the situation
                    was.</p>
                <p>I went back down to Salinas Airport, which is where the 82nd Airborne Division
                    had set up its Command Post. The Commanding General was not there, but I talked
                    to his chief of staff and some of the staff officers. I told them what the
                    situation was and said that we very much needed to “quarantine” the Libyan
                    Embassy. We weren't going to “lay hands on them.” We just wanted to make sure
                    that they didn't leave the Embassy and go off and do the “nefarious deeds” they
                    had been instructed to do. You should remember that all of the communist bloc
                    countries had representatives there: the North Koreans; the Soviets, of course;
                    and I forget who else was there. It was the strangest crowd you ever saw were in
                    Grenada at that time. It included the Libyans.</p>
                <p>I obtained the agreement of the 82nd Airborne Division staff to supply three
                    squads of infantry, or something like that. I think it was three squads to serve
                    for three, 8-hour shifts. I was to find out exactly where they were to go. Of
                    course, we had very limited communications. A lot of the communications were
                    accomplished by simply running back and forth, over terrible roads. I'd never
                    seen roads in the condition of the roads in Grenada. Even in Africa I'd never
                    seen anything like that, with all of those potholes. We were told that there
                    were some Cubans “running loose” in the countryside who might be sniping at
                    traffic. We had to be careful. When darkness fell, you didn't wander around
                    outside of Georgetown, the capital of Grenada.</p>

                <p>As I was leaving the 82nd Airborne Division Command Post, I ran into the
                    Commanding General, whom I had not previously met. I recall that Tom Enders had
                    told me that the Commanding General of the 82nd Airborne had been the Defense
                    Attach� in Spain when Tom was Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>When I had been shopping around for a job, before the Grenada exercise began, I
                    had tried to get a job in the ARA Bureau. When Enders was “kicked upstairs,” he
                    was offered the position of Ambassador to Spain, which he accepted. He told me
                    that he was considering offering me the position of DCM in Madrid, but I hadn't
                    been promoted to senior rank at that point. He felt that I really didn't have
                    enough rank to be DCM in Madrid. You had to have the rank, as DCM, because of
                    characters like this general, who didn't like the Foreign Service and
                    particularly didn't like USIA [United States Information Agency]. He felt that
                    they were all a bunch of “comsymps” [communist sympathizers], fellow travelers,
                    or who knows what.</p>
                <p>It turned out that this general went from Madrid to be commanding general of the
                    82nd Airborne Division. We met as I was walking out of the division command
                    post. He said, “Who are you?” I was dressed in a sport shirt and khaki pants.
                    The only badge of authority that I had was a Navy hat, which, I think, had on it
                    the name of the USS COMTE DE GRASSE, one of the frigates which had visited the
                    Bahamas. I identified myself and told him what the situation was and what we
                    needed. His reaction was very quickly negative. He said, “I don't take orders
                    from the State Department.” He said, you can't come down here and demand the use
                    of our troops outside of channels. Well, I decided that this was probably not
                    the place to tell this “jerk” off. I was thinking, “Man, your name is mud if
                    somebody is grabbed by the Libyans tonight” if we hadn't secured the Libyan
                    Embassy. Anyway, I thought that I shouldn't pick a fight with this general at
                    this point.</p>
                <p>So I drove back to the hotel which we were using as a sort of Embassy. I don't
                    think that we ever did “nail down” the Libyans. I think that they took cover in
                    the Soviet Embassy, as did all of the communist bloc representatives. They were
                    subsequently evacuated from there to Cuba. As it turned out, as things went on,
                    after the initial operations were completed, this was sort of a high-powered
                    position for a major general. When he left Grenada, the Army left a brigadier
                    general in command of the balance of the 82nd Airborne units on the island. But
                    for the several weeks I assisted in running things in the Embassy in Georgetown,
                    the General and I developed a pretty good relationship. There were no hard
                    feelings. But I never really forgot his reaction. In all of the years that I've
                    been associating with the military, during all of those years in Indochina,
                    Japan and Korea, for example, I'd never had that kind of negative reaction from
                    a U. S. flag officer. I think that it was too bad that I'd gotten in touch with
                    a guy like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Regarding the other job that I'd tried to get, the position of Principal Officer
                    in Bermuda was opening up. I tried very hard to get that job, because it was
                    still a Foreign Service assignment. I pushed very hard for it. That job came
                    under EUR [the Bureau of European Affairs], because Bermuda is a British Colony.
                    Enders had arranged for me to go and see Richard Burt, then Assistant Secretary
                    for European Affairs. I made my “pitch” to him and said that I would very much
                    like that assignment, if I could get it. I didn't get the job because, as it
                    turned out, somebody in the White House wanted it. The former Director of
                    Legislative Affairs in the White House decided that he wanted to get out of heat
                    of the kitchen for a while. He could have had any Embassy that he wanted. He
                    didn't want an Embassy. He wanted a very soft touch, Foreign Service post, which
                    turned out to be Bermuda. The Department cut short the tour of the Foreign
                    Service Officer who was there, to accommodate this White House guy. It really
                    left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
                <p>In a sense, I was probably well off that I didn't get the assignment to Bermuda
                    because it would probably have been like taking the job as Principal Officer in
                    Martinique. In terms of a Foreign Service career...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a dead end.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: But I was desperate. I wanted to stay in the area and didn't want to go
                    back to Washington.</p>
                <p>Another post that I had a “crack” at was the position of DCM in Bridgetown,
                    Barbados. The Ambassador to Barbados was a political appointee from Indiana. We
                    had become acquainted when I was charg� d'affaires in Nassau. We met at Chiefs
                    of Mission conferences and that sort of thing. He asked me if I'd like to be DCM
                    in Bridgetown. The tour of the DCM assigned there was coming to an end. I said,
                    “Sure, that would be a great job.” However, the Ambassador made the mistake of
                    submitting his own resignation before he offered me the job. So I wasn't about
                    to get that “plum.” This discussion with the Ambassador to Barbados took place
                    before the Grenada intervention occurred. Anyway, I ended up in Grenada and
                    spent almost two months there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Charles Gillespie's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: In effect, he was acting chief of mission. The Assistant Secretary of
                    State for ARA, Tony Motley, visited us on several occasions to see what was
                    going on. I think that Charley was given the personal rank of Ambassador to do
                    the job. His basic function was to set up some sort of Embassy in transition,
                    because the U. S. military would not be able to stay there forever. It was not
                    desirable to have them stay there for any extended period of time. The task was
                    to try to pull things together and put Grenada back on the road to political
                    health. There were big problems there. Grenada is just a tiny, little island—the
                    top of a volcano, really, with a population of 100,000.</p>
                <p>Aside from the economic assistance that they required, there was high
                    unemployment. Over the years the Marxists had really done the place in to a
                    terrible extent. The late Prime Minister Bishop was genuinely admired as a
                    leader, but he was a Marxist. Of course, the great subject for discussion at the
                    time was that he was on the way to making a deal with the U. S. when he was
                    “killed.” The big problem was to establish a police force that could control the
                    place. The police had been disarmed by the Ultra-Leftists.</p>
                <p>The other problem was to punish the remaining Ultra-Leftists who had murdered
                    Bishop. We never found his body, though we spent a lot of time looking for it.
                    The conventional wisdom was that after he and his cohorts had been executed in
                    one of the forts—Ft. Rupert, I think it was—their bodies were taken out to sea
                    and fed to the sharks.</p>
                <p>I spent most of my time in Grenada helping to organize the Embassy. After
                    Gillespie, I was the next senior officer at the post. After a month there, I
                    decided that I would not try to get the job of charg� d'affaires. We obviously
                    would have a charg�, with the Ambassador in Bridgetown, Barbados, also
                    accredited there. That was how the Department arranged it. There were no
                    schools, and Grenada was no place where I could take my children. Conditions
                    were really primitive. It would have been a tough situation. We were about 100
                    miles from Barbados. It was pleasant enough, but pretty primitive. You might as
                    well be somewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.I stayed on in Grenada until early
                    December, 1983.</p>
                <p>I think that one of the puzzling things about the Grenada experience was that
                    almost everybody that had been involved, on the State Department side, received
                    an award of some kind—Superior Honor Award or Meritorious Honor Award. I was the
                    only person who was not even mentioned as having been involved, yet I was
                    “running” the Embassy and was one of the first to volunteer to go there. As I
                    had just been promoted and had come out of a charg� d'affaires position in
                    Nassau, I wasn't too worried about this. Nothing particularly good was going to
                    happen to me, anyway, but I considered that this was clear evidence that
                    somebody was “out to get me.” Even the janitor got an award for the Grenada
                    operation, presented by the Secretary of State. I found this curious, to say the
                    least.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>As it turned out, it took Tony Gillespie two years to do an efficiency report. I
                    didn't get this report—really a memorandum report—until I was in Korea two years
                    later. It was a fair enough and accurate report on my activities but I had to
                    “bug” him to do that, just so that the record would be clear that I had done
                    this venture. I found this a commentary on how things were handled between
                    colleagues. That sort of thing has probably existed forever, but it was my first
                    real experience with a colleague “doing me in” or shunting me aside—making sure
                    that I wasn't going to share in the experience or the rewards. All of the other
                    experiences that I had had in Africa, Indochina, and Japan had been “positive.”
                    I had done a good piece of work, been loyal, and had virtually “jumped in by
                    parachute.” I was recognized for doing this sort of thing before. I have also
                    been able to recover from career “mishaps.” This was the first experience that I
                    had of this kind of thing, and it saddened me. I'm saying this because it's all
                    part and parcel of the Foreign Service.</p>

                <p>Well, I came back to Washington [in December, 1983]. There were no jobs available
                    as a Chief of Mission or Principal Officer. There was some talk about the
                    ambassadorship in Equatorial Guinea but that was snapped up by the General
                    Counsel of USAID. Your old job as Consul General in Seoul had opened up again. I
                    decided that what had happened during the previous six months was a clear
                    message to me that I was “notorious” and probably wasn't going to get much of
                    anything if I hung around the Department. Since my wife was still pressing me to
                    stay out of Washington, I decided to take the job in Seoul and get as “far away
                    from headquarters” as possible. The assignment became official in December,
                    1983, and I went to Seoul in January, 1984.</p>
                <p>Ken Keller was still there as Consul General. He was retiring from the Foreign
                    Service. He had replaced me three years before when my assignment to Seoul had
                    been “canceled,” as I indicated previously. He wasn't due to leave Seoul until
                    February, 1984, but, rather than hang around Washington, I decided that I would
                    go out to Seoul a little early.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>I stopped off in Honolulu to talk to the District Director of the INS
                    [Immigration and Naturalization Service], Sam Feldman, who had been in Hong Kong
                    when I was in the Embassy in Bangkok. We had done the Indochina refugee “thing”
                    together. He was still in Hong Kong at the time of the fall of Indochina to the
                    communists. Sam was one of these hard-charging INS guys who apparently took on
                    the Asian organized crime syndicates, or at least Pacific Island organized
                    crime—especially the Samoans, apparently a very tough crowd in Hawaii. A few
                    months later, after our meeting in Hong Kong and resuming contact there, he
                    committed suicide. He shot himself, so there was no question that one of the
                    criminal “tongs” had done him in. I was really shocked when that happened. Sam
                    was a gruff kind of guy but once he accepted you as a colleague, that was it. We
                    had that kind of relationship—we in the old line consular service. I've talked
                    to people in INS since then, and they felt that this was strictly due to
                    “stress.” They hadn't recognized until that time that stress could play such a
                    role in INS.</p>
                <p>I took over the Consular Section in Seoul in February, 1984, after Ken Keller
                    left. I found the Section somewhat in disarray. Ken and the fraud unit had
                    uncovered a major fraud ring in the Section, centered in the fraud unit itself.
                    I should say that the Fraud Officer led the investigation to find these people.
                    We fired 12 local employees in the Consular Section, including the senior
                    security local employee, who apparently was involved in the fraud. I found that
                    relations between the American and Korean staff in the Section were very poor,
                    very tense, very fragile. There was a lot of resentment on both sides. The
                    Americans were distrustful and resentful toward the Koreans, and the Koreans, of
                    course, felt great resentment toward the Americans because the Americans felt
                    that way.</p>
                <p>Ken was a very competent and professional officer and had run a “very tight
                    ship.” The place was working, we were issuing 30,000 immigrant visas a year and
                    almost 100,000 non-immigrant visas.</p>
                <p>I thought that the first thing that I would try to do was to try and establish
                    better relations between the Korean and American staff. My experience in
                    Bangkok, under similar circumstances, although on a smaller scale, had been that
                    if you could not make friends with the local employees, if the local employees
                    weren't going to help you, you're never going to be able to fight this battle
                    against fraud. You're never going to win this battle in any case. You can't even
                    fight this battle against fraud if at least some of the local employees aren't
                    going to be supportive. I decided that it behooved me to try to improve
                    relations between members of this large staff—47 Korean employees and something
                    like 20 Americans.</p>
                <p>There was a very competent cadre of Americans there. They knew their job and were
                    doing it very well. Bruce Beardsley was my deputy in the Consular Section. He's
                    gone on to do very well in the Foreign Service. Of course, I knew the DCM but
                    didn't know the Ambassador before I arrived there. The DCM at the time was Paul
                    Cleveland, an old friend from Indochina days, when he was a staff aide to
                    Marshall Green. I felt that I would have the support of the front office of the
                    Embassy in anything that I would need to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>I decided that as a first step I would try to get to know the local employees of
                    the Consular Section a bit better—at least have some direct contact with them. I
                    started a program of meeting privately, in my office, for about 10-15 minutes
                    with every local employee, “pressing the flesh” and showing the human face of
                    bureaucracy. I think that worked, to a certain extent. At that time the Korean
                    staff was overwhelmingly female. A lot of them had come out of the Peace Corps
                    and the aid program. When those programs were phased out in South Korea in the
                    1970's, a lot of these people had gone to work in the Consular Section. The
                    situation was very well summed up by one of the younger women employees who was
                    willing to talk to me. In the case of most of the employees, I'd call them into
                    my office, ask them to sit down, and try to talk to them. They would say very
                    little but would be quite circumspect. I knew that this was because not too many
                    people did this, particularly in Korea, a male-dominated society. As we know,
                    the turnover in American staff like that is tremendous, particularly in vice
                    consuls. Everybody does things differently, from the Consul General on down.
                    Every supervisor is different. I could see where the local employees would say,
                    “Don't bet your life on any one of these people because, after a few months,
                    there'll be a change of boss.” I understood that.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, one of the younger and friendlier members of the staff said that she had
                    been told by the older women, “When we need to talk to the Americans, we [the
                    older women] will talk to the Americans.” In other words, “shut up.” That was a
                    clear message to me that it was going to be a hard row to hoe. We would really
                    have to “divide and conquer” here and do the best we could in terms of improving
                    working conditions, which are always a problem for our staffs, and trying to be
                    friendly and outgoing.I would regularly go around the Section, see what was
                    going on, and just try and stay on top of things. This is very much what the
                    boss has to do. You know this from your own experience, as you're a friendly,
                    outgoing type of guy, anyway. My experience had been that you really can't tell
                    what your staff is up to by simply going up to the “visa line” and standing
                    behind them and listening to conversations. Even if you're an ultra democrat and
                    sit down and issue visas with your officers, as some consular section chiefs do,
                    you're not really going to find out what's going on. I thought that I had other
                    things to do beside going up there and issuing visas. “Showing the flag” helps
                    out. I've done all of that. I've issued all of the visas that I want to do.</p>
                <p>I've found that one of the great demands put upon the section chief by Korean
                    society is that you get to be the ultimate “court of appeals” for visa refusals.
                    I got involved in visa issuance because the Ambassador, the DCM, “Minister So
                    and So,” or someone else would call me up and “put the arm on me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall that the only time I've ever been in an actual
                        “shouting match” with anybody was in Korea. That was with the Political
                        Counselor at the time, Paul Cleveland. We made it up afterwards, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: He was calmer when he was DCM. We had more “shouting matches” with the
                    commercial section chief because Korean businessmen were really “putting the arm
                    on him.” At times the situation was very tense. I consider myself very much a
                    “team player.” I had been a charg� d'affaires and run my own Embassy. So I was
                    not parochial. I had done other things. I had been a political officer and a
                    desk officer in the Department. I understand where all of these guys are coming
                    from, and you've got to help them out.</p>
                <p>So I decided that, normally, my deputy would be the ultimate “appeals court.” We
                    were already doing this, to some extent. I decided that I would get involved in
                    the process as well, because I think that this is the only way that you can “tap
                    into” the system and find out what your officers are telling the applicants. You
                    recognize that, initially at least, you're only hearing the appeals of those who
                    are well placed. They are the only people who are able to appeal, through
                    somebody. What I wanted to find out was what's happening to the ordinary visa
                    applicant? Aside from any democratic feelings that I might have, I really needed
                    to know how I could find out what was happening. Once you can find that out and
                    they know that you're finding it out, the whole system works better. Once the
                    vice consul or the unit chiefs feel that they're not answerable to anybody, then
                    everything deteriorates after that.</p>
                <p>I found that what angered me a great deal, that vice consuls, for whatever
                    reason, sometimes feel so full of themselves that nobody can “talk back” to
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This disease is called “vice consulitis.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I found it very reprehensible. I have experienced it since I retired,
                    as I've gone back to places that I knew. I noted that these vice consuls are
                    junior officers. One of your biggest jobs as a section chief is to bring those
                    junior officers along and teach them the “trade,” not the “trade” of being a
                    vice consul but of being a Foreign Service Officer—the value system of the
                    Foreign Service. I thought that was very important.</p>
                <p>I decided that we had to start out with a “level playing field.” The vice consuls
                    had to know that I knew what they were doing, and not because I was standing
                    behind them or listening to them. I was going to review the record of their
                    cases on a very representative, ad hoc, basis. The biggest problem I had was to
                    get people to keep decent notes on the application forms. I said, “Look, a visa
                    application is practically a court document. These things have ended up in court
                    and become subjects of litigation. I want you to keep decent notes on them. I
                    can assure you that when I review or handle a case, I keep very detailed notes
                    as to what was said and the reasons for my decision. That's what I want you guys
                    to do. I realize that I have more time to do this. I've got leisure to do this.
                    I've got a nice office to sit in, and you're sitting out there on the visa line.
                    But you've got to do better. You never know whether we'll have to go to court on
                    some case. I may have to justify overturning your decision.”</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>Anyway, keeping visa records became a “growth” industry. It soon became known
                    that Antippas would listen to anybody. I let it be known that anybody could talk
                    to me. You didn't have to go through somebody who knew somebody. I had an “open
                    door” policy. I tried to be careful about that.</p>
                <p>Appearances are so important, as you well know, particularly in Korea. I guess
                    that I personally handled 10 or 12 visa cases a day. People would make
                    appointments to appeal decisions that had been made on cases. I would have the
                    cases brought to me and would review them. Of course, frequently they would be
                    brought to me by somebody who was somebody. Most frequently, I would overturn
                    the decision made. I would find that the 30 seconds which the vice consul had to
                    listen to this person, who may have been standing out in the snow for eight
                    hours, before making his decision, had not been enough to bring out all aspects
                    of the case. Generally, I would let the intermediary sit with me. I would tell
                    them, “Don't say anything. The conversation is between me, the applicant, and my
                    Korean secretary.” I would ask all of the questions that I needed to ask before
                    coming to my conclusion.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, my perception would be a little different from that of the
                    vice consul, probably because of my own long experience and my understanding of
                    the ethos of Korean society. Finally, I would say to the intermediary, if there
                    was one, “All right. I will grant the visitor's visa. When is this individual
                    coming back to Korea? Tell me the date when he or she is coming back.” I would
                    say, “I don't care when it is—three months or six months from now. You tell me.
                    I will mark it in my book that I want you to come to the Consular Section and
                    see me. Don't send the person's passport over. You come and see me. If the
                    person doesn't come and see me, don't call me again on a visa application.”</p>
                <p>By doing that I found that very few people double-crossed me. Some people would.
                    They were in the business of influence peddling. There was no greater currency
                    in Seoul than to say that you knew the American Consul General. That is still
                    the case today. I hear that the situation today is as bad as when I got
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As bad as that? You're always shoveling against the sea
                        but you can't give up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I hear complaints about the attitude of American consular officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I'm sure that the American officers are talking about
                        the illegals, the people who are slipping through. Anyway...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I was doing that on that level. However, as Counselor of Embassy for
                    Consular Affairs my job was to take a “strategic” view of the problem. I took
                    off on that area on two fronts.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>One of the things that really angered me was to discover, given my extended
                    knowledge of Korea and my understanding of what had happened, having been there
                    from the beginning, so to speak—as you had—was “GI brides” and the possibilities
                    for fraud which this involved.</p>
                <p>Just before I went to Grenada, the “20-20” TV program had done a lengthy program
                    on Korean prostitute rings working on the U. S. military in Korea. This wasn't
                    anything that I had invented. When I got to Korea, I walked the “trench line” in
                    the Consular Section and tried to figure out what I could do on the margins to
                    change and improve things. One of the things that ticked me off was to see the
                    “obvious” fraud that took place in GI marriages, when a young GI would come in
                    with a woman 20 years older than he was who looked well traveled and well worn.
                    You knew perfectly well what had happened. Old soldiers knew very well what had
                    happened. This annoyed me. It was one of my hobby horses. I thought that I would
                    like to do something to change this situation.</p>
                <p>The Immigration Attach� in Seoul during my stay there was sympathetic to my view,
                    because he, of course, had to approve the petitions which the GI's were
                    executing on behalf of their Korean “brides.” We would make inquiries at the
                    U.S.- Korean Command. There were certain areas and certain centers of interest
                    where the Korean Command would have liked to see us improve that situation.</p>
                <p>First of all, you had to recognize that nobody can tell American citizens whom
                    they can marry. Changing the circumstances under which GI's met these women is
                    really beyond the Theater Commander. This is a Washington level problem.
                    However, as I looked at the problem, what I discovered was that, given the way
                    that the American military were operating in Korea, we had the phenomenon of
                    “homesteaders.” That is, there were officers and enlisted personnel who spent a
                    large part of their careers in South Korea. In many cases they were married to
                    Koreans and really had a vested interest in that country. They kind of
                    specialized in Korea.</p>
                <p>Among the offshoots we had of this problem at this time was black marketing and
                    currency speculation. We're talking now about 1984, before the economic
                    “takeoff” happened in South Korea. There still was a thriving black market for
                    commissary and PX merchandise. On the black market a banana would cost you a
                    dollar. You would have fights between the Korean and the American wives in the
                    commissary over bunches of bananas. I know that my wife once threatened to
                    “belt” somebody over an issue like this. The Provost Marshal when I told him
                    said, “No, don't let her do that!” There were scandals of this kind. I felt that
                    the American Army wasn't looking very good. There were prostitution rings.</p>
                <p>I did a long-term research study of the problem, pulling in all of the
                    information I could obtain from INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] and
                    other sources about what was happening to a lot of these wives when they went to
                    the United States, particularly if they remained in the U. S. military, and the
                    kind of Korean communities that were springing up outside of military cantonment
                    areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>I also checked law enforcement reports. These wives weren't really involved in
                    drug trafficking, but they were involved in large-scale trafficking in
                    commissary goods—fur coats, jewelry, and electronic equipment. This was a time
                    when a Foreign Service employee could sell his property in Korea, because local
                    Korean industry wasn't producing merchandise of this kind. They started doing
                    that a couple of years later, and after that, there was no way you could get rid
                    of your old stereo set. Remember, before the Korean economy “took off,” you
                    could still sell your old stereo, buy new equipment at the PX, and refurbish
                    everything. This was in 1984. Things changed a great deal in a couple of
                    years.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of trade going on in these Korean communities around the military
                    cantonment areas in the U.S. It was very clear that there were major
                    prostitution rings as well—not necessarily because the Korean women went there
                    as prostitutes. They were more or less “forced” into prostitution. They borrowed
                    money so that the U. S. immigration visa “fixer” could “hire” the GI to marry
                    them. They went to the United States with him but they owed money to the “ring.”
                    Very frequently, the GI would “drop” them. Even the GIs who married these women
                    for love had second thoughts, once they were married. A lot of these Korean
                    women were just “dumped.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Koreans are very tough on their women. They have no
                        compunction about sending in some “bully boys” to beat them up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: There were gangs called the “Korean Killers” and others. As I say, they
                    stayed away from narcotics, as far as I could tell—unlike the Chinese, Thai, and
                    maybe the Vietnamese gangs. The Koreans were a little more circumspect, but it
                    was very clear that they had very sophisticated prostitution rings operating. A
                    great source of supply was these Korean women who were marrying GIs and who were
                    subsequently jettisoned.</p>
                <p>I felt that I was on firm ground to be pushing this as an issue, from a strategic
                    point of view. I worked very hard on this matter. I managed to get the chief of
                    staff of the Eighth Army on my side—a major general. The first chief of staff
                    was not interested. His replacement was different. I think that he and his wife
                    were “born again” Christians, or something like that. They had very high moral
                    standards. He was much more cooperative. Once I got him on my side, I found that
                    the rest of his staff was cooperative.</p>
                <p>I found, for example, that senior military chaplains were very cooperative. The
                    junior chaplains—the majors and the captains— didn't seem to care very much. The
                    older, “bull” colonels among the chaplains understand what we were trying to
                    do.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>Dealing with this problem was an interesting exercise. It involved my going on
                    AFK [Armed Forces in Korea] TV and giving talks with the Immigration Attach� ,
                    saying what was involved and trying to get the Korean Command to change the
                    regulations under which people were “counseled” about the implications of
                    getting married. I think that the culmination of this whole effort took place
                    when the Chief of Staff of the Army came to Korea. I think that he was the
                    commanding general of the Eighth Army when you were in Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was there, the commanding general of the Eighth
                        Army was General Stilwell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It was the man who replaced Stilwell. I can't remember his name. He was
                    not a guy that I particularly liked. I don't think that anybody else liked him,
                    either. Stilwell was a very good guy. I got to know him quite well after he
                    retired.</p>
                <p>Anyway, an FSO on his staff whom you knew, I think, was George Barbis. George is
                    an old friend of mine, of course—part of the Greek “Mafia” in the Foreign
                    Service. George was working as a kind of special assistant to the Chief of
                    Staff. He came to Korea on several occasions with the Chief of Staff. I went to
                    George and said, “Look, I'm working on this problem.” Of course, George himself
                    had served in Korea in the 50's. He had a lot of Korean friends and was
                    sympathetic.</p>
                <p>“Dixie” Walker, who was the Ambassador to Korea at the time, was sympathetic to
                    my efforts as well. Ambassador Walker arranged for me to “brief” the Chief of
                    Staff of the Army during one of his visits. The briefing was held in the
                    Conference Room at the Embassy. I gave him a kind of “read out” of what I just
                    told you here. I gave him a copy of a long dispatch that I had written to the
                    Department on the nature of the problem, mentioning all of the INS reports of
                    what was going on outside the American Army cantonments in the States and all of
                    that. I tried to make the point to the Chief of Staff that I was a very good
                    friend of the American Army. I said that I had had a “love affair” with the Army
                    since I was a kid. I said that I thought that this situation was giving the Army
                    a bad name. I tried to tell the Chief of Staff that I was not trying to “attack”
                    the Army.</p>
                <p>Of course, as you could predict, the reaction of the Chief of Staff was
                    defensive. He said, in effect, “Well, I guess we have to do something to make
                    our soldiers less 'masculine,'” or a wiseacre comment about “ too much
                    testosterone,” or something like that. Anyway, the briefing didn't go off too
                    well. There was obviously very little that the Chief of Staff could do.
                    Washington was not prepared to say...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Korea from 1976 to 1979. I looked at this issue
                        and said, “There's nothing that we can do about it.” But it still was an
                        issue of importance. You picked an issue where you thought that you could do
                        something. We were “clamping down” on American civilians in those days. We
                        told them that they couldn't get married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: They were told not to get married. However, one of the interesting
                    aspects of this matter was that my thinking continued to evolve in this
                    connection. As I looked at the records available in the Consular Section, one of
                    the things that concerned me was where in hell all of these Koreans were coming
                    from in the United States. Based on the records available in the Consular
                    Section, there were some hundreds of thousands of Koreans who had gotten to the
                    U. S. illegally. Even if you factored in the number of those who had
                    “overstayed” on visitors' visas, it still didn't add up. These Koreans were in
                    Los Angeles, New York, and every place else. They were springing up all over the
                    place.</p>
                <p>Then from the CIA reporting from the “Blue House” [Presidential Mansion], it was
                    clear that the Chun Doo Hwan administration was encouraging the movement of
                    Koreans to the U. S. The view of the Korean Government was to encourage
                    emigration, because this was how to get rid of protestors. But there also was a
                    reverse benefit. There would be large communities of Koreans in the U. S. who
                    were amenable to the Korean administration's way of thinking. They thought that
                    this was a good development.</p>
                <p>I had decided that the prostitution issue was worth fighting for because it was
                    clear to me that if we didn't “tighten up,” in some fashion, we'd have a
                    continuous “leak” of Koreans into the U. S..</p>
                <p>I continued to look for ways to slow down the visa trafficking. I was trying to
                    do something because it was clear that there was an absolute “flood” of Koreans
                    heading for the countries South of the U. S. - Mexican border. They were making
                    it into the United States in that way, particularly from Mexico. In fact, there
                    was a Korean movie issued in 1987, called, “Deep Blue Night.” It was about a
                    Korean illegal immigrant who goes to Los Angeles through Mexico and recounts his
                    shenanigans with some women there. This was quite scandalous at the time it came
                    out in Seoul in 1985, I think, because there was a lot of nudity. I said, “This
                    thing is a training film on how to get people into the United States.” I put in
                    a lot of effort, trying to persuade my consular colleagues to tighten up their
                    visa requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the U. S. Army Chief of Staff turned down your
                        efforts to do something about GI “marriages,” did that pretty well end what
                        you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Well, yes. Obviously, it was a very limited effort. We could only try
                    to do something on the margins. I subsequently received a note from George
                    Barbis on the stationery of the Chief of Staff of the U. S. Army. I still have
                    that note somewhere. He referred to some kind of scandal regarding Korean
                    prostitutes and said, “You tried to tell us about this some time ago, and here
                    it is in the news.” It was sort of a moral victory, I thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:When did you leave Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I left Korea in August, 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I went to Montreal as Principal Officer. I'm telling you a lot of this
                    to lay the groundwork for what I'm going to tell you about Montreal, in terms of
                    where I thought I stood in the “pecking order” of things in Korea—in terms of my
                    personal status. It was more than being just chief of the Consular Section, the
                    guy who issued the visas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. So we'll pick it up when you left Korea. We'll
                        talk about your going to Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 21, 1994. You left Korea. Where did you
                        go? Could you give the dates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I left Korea in the first week of August, 1988. I was assigned as
                    Principal Officer in Montreal, a position which I had sought over a number of
                    years. I thought that would be a very nice assignment. I was not unfamiliar with
                    Montreal. It seemed like a “classy” town. I had the choice between being DCM in
                    Haiti or Principal Officer in Montreal. My wife wanted Haiti because the weather
                    was nicer, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she is Canadian, isn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: My wife is Canadian—from Ontario. And there's a difference. She's
                    always tried to learn a language wherever we've been assigned—at least pick up
                    some of the language. When someone suggested that she should pick up French, she
                    just dug her heels in. This is the Ontarian coming out, loud and clear. I had to
                    “shut her up” a few times over French-English issuers in the Province. It was
                    interesting to see how the nationalist fur rises, you know.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>Anyway, I decided that I'd rather be “Number One” in Montreal, rather than
                    “Number Two” in Haiti, plus the fact that I just felt that I had watched what
                    had happened in Haiti from the vantage point of the Bahamas. As I knew a number
                    of people who served in Haiti, I thought that there wasn't a future in Haiti for
                    anyone. However, as it turned out, there wasn't a future in Montreal, either.
                    That's the unique feature about Montreal, as pleasant an assignment as it
                    was.</p>
                <p>I finally arrived in Montreal in October, 1988, because my predecessor had
                    delayed his departure because of some medical problems. Instead of going to
                    Montreal in mid-September, which would be the normal transfer time, I had to
                    delay my arrival for three weeks.</p>
                <p>We decided that, after spending the requisite period of time here in the United
                    States, doing my French test, taking home leave, and arranging for consultations
                    and all of that, we wondered what we would do. We thought that we couldn't sit
                    around in a motel some place. So we decided to go back to Korea for the opening
                    of the Olympic Games. With all of the travel we had done, we had enough pieces
                    of tickets left over from the four years we had been in Korea, plus the fact
                    that my daughter was studying in France and in Quebec during that whole period.
                    I was bringing her home every two months, so we had lots of tickets lying
                    around. We decided to go back to Korea and be with our friends.</p>
                <p>The Koreans were so enthusiastic about the Olympic Games. We had watched them put
                    this altogether over a four-year period. We thought that it would be nice to be
                    there. It was a fun time. I mention this because it has relevance for what
                    happened later.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Montreal in the first week of October, 1988. The snow was just about
                    ready to fly. I thought that it was a nice post, heavily oriented toward the
                    consular and commercial functions. At that time the Consulate General had been
                    in a high-rise building in downtown Montreal. The Consular Section was on the
                    ground floor. Twelve floors up was the rest of the Consulate General. We had a
                    problem of a bifurcated office, which caused a bit of difficulty in terms of
                    organization and the flow of information. The problem was not insuperable, but
                    it was still difficult.</p>
                <p>Montreal is a post where you probably get a hundred different nationalities
                    coming in, asking for visas. This was a different experience from anything I
                    ever had before. Montreal really is a “gateway” to North America. In terms of
                    the consular function it was an interesting and busy post.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>The first decision that I had to deal with, which, I think, eventually became a
                    problem for me, was who was I going to designate as my deputy. There was no
                    “deputy” slot at the post. Obviously, I had to have a senior officer, whom I
                    would leave in charge when I was not present. It was a “toss up” between the
                    Economic Officer and the chief of the Consular Section. Both of them were
                    FSO-4's—and experienced officers. They were at the same grade, but the chief of
                    the Consular Section had a bit longer in grade than the Economic Officer. The
                    chief of the Consular Section was not at post when I arrived. He was on home
                    leave. My predecessor left me a note, saying, “This is a decision which you're
                    going to have to make on this issue.” He gave me some hints and his
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p>I decided to designate the Economic Officer as my deputy, first, because his
                    office was close to my own office. He worked very closely with the Principal
                    Officer. We also had a Commercial Officer. The chief of the Consular Section, of
                    course, was located down on the ground floor. I decided that it probably made
                    more sense to designate the Economic Officer as my deputy, because the chief of
                    the Consular Section really had a “full plate.” He had a busy office, a large
                    staff, and lots of things to do. I was sympathetic to his position, as I had
                    just left a Consular Section. The Economic Officer spoke French very well. The
                    chief of the Consular Section did not speak French very well. That is really
                    critical for a post in Quebec Province. You have to speak French. You just get
                    laughed off the street if you're not able to handle office business in French. I
                    mention this because this ended up by becoming a problem, due to the resentment
                    generated by this selection.</p>
                <p>I had a pretty good Administrative Office and a first class Secretary. One of the
                    problems that the Consulate General in Montreal had faced previously was that,
                    at one time, there were two American secretaries assigned. This was subsequently
                    reduced to one American secretary. The post also had a communicator. One of the
                    things that the American secretary had to do was to be able to handle
                    communications and stand communications watch every other weekend. In the past
                    this situation had posed a problem. In fact, the previous Secretary had made a
                    real “fuss” about doing communications work, aside from the fact that the
                    communications watch required a commitment to be present every other weekend.
                    It's also a difficult job. The equipment now has become so sophisticated. It's
                    not just the old “punch a tape” business. You really have to be able to work
                    with this equipment. It's all computerized and takes a lot of savvy. I can
                    understand that. However, I remember that in the inspection report for 1987, the
                    year before I was assigned there, this was mentioned as a problem.</p>
                <p>The question of the communications watch every other weekend for the American
                    secretary eventually became a personnel problem for me because the new
                    Ambassador, a political appointee, arrived in Ottawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: This was Edward Ney, a New York advertising mogul and a personal friend
                    of President George Bush. They had gone to the same prep school. He was a nice
                    enough guy—not a bad sort. He listened to what I had to say. Anyhow, he
                    “hijacked” my secretary to be his secretary in Ottawa. What could I say about
                    that? It was a promotion for her, a step up, and all that. I put the best face
                    on it and said, “Well, at least I've got one friend at court. Not only that,
                    I've got an ear at court.”</p>
                <p>However, I think that the loss of my secretary was a disaster for me during my
                    tenure in Montreal. I'll tell you why in the course of this description of the
                    post. I found that the biggest problem that I faced in Montreal was something
                    that I didn't realize until I actually got there. I discussed this problem with
                    Tom Enders, the previous Ambassador to Canada and an old colleague of mine.</p>
                <p>Montreal and Quebec City are unique in the Foreign Service in that they are the
                    only two constituent posts in a single province that we have in the Foreign
                    Service. Normally, the arrangement is that you have a constituent post to cover
                    several provinces in a country. Of course, the other aspect of this is that
                    Montreal, historically, has been perceived as being “the English” town in the
                    Province. That is, it is “the enemy.” In point of fact, that was not true.
                    Almost half of the population of Montreal are now French speakers. Most of the
                    officials of the provincial government are French Qu�b�cois. Ironically many are
                    from Montreal and live in Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, by the time you were there, the English-speaking
                        “establishment” had moved over to Toronto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Exactly. They had all moved out. They were scared to death when the PQ
                    [Parti Qu�b�cois—the Quebec Party] came into power in 1976. However, the fact is
                    that the perception was that Montreal is the “enemy” [of the French speakers].
                    Most countries represented in Canada have their consulates in Montreal because
                    it is still a commercial and banking center. In fact, when I was in Montreal,
                    there were only two Principal Officers in Quebec City.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Quebec City is relatively small.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It's a provincial capital. Only the U. S. and the French have
                    Consulates in Quebec City. In fact, the French had a Consulate whose Principal
                    Officer had the rank of Ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>Anyway, this posed a real problem for the Principal Officer of the American
                    Consulate General in Montreal because he really doesn't have a job. The basic
                    function of the Principal Officer of a Consulate General, of course, is to
                    manage the post. His other main function is political reporting. That's your
                    reason for being, really. That's why one is expected to speak French, when you
                    go to a post like that. However, the Provincial Government of Quebec didn't want
                    to talk to Principal Officers of the Consulates in Montreal if the discussions
                    were to be in Montreal. If you wanted to talk officially to the Province you
                    were to go to Quebec City.</p>
                <p>Now, one of my predecessors, B. J. Harper, had a good experience in Montreal in
                    the mid 1970's because the then Premier of Quebec, Rene Levesque, had an office
                    in Montreal and most importantly wanted to talk to the Americans. He spent a lot
                    of time in Montreal, and B. J. Harper had access to him. That's what it
                    takes—some kind of access to the political leader. It doesn't matter whether
                    this access is formal or not. The fact is that this is the basis on which you
                    can write reports. Who cares what the Mayor of Montreal says? So, in fact, I was
                    accredited to the Mayor of Montreal but no first person discussions to
                    report.</p>
                <p>Of course we had a lot of fun. It was a nice post. I'm not taking away from the
                    fact that Montreal is a lovely city. We had a nice house, a car, and a couple of
                    servants. We were living better than I did when I was charg� d'affaires in the
                    Bahamas. But from the point of view of the job, Montreal was a cipher and a
                    great disappointment to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Tape 9, Side A of the interview with Andy
                        Antippas. You were saying that the post was a disappointment in that
                        respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: As you well know, if you want to cover yourself with glory for onward
                    promotions and assignments, a Principal Officer at least needs to “set the
                    agenda” in terms of what the post is going to do and the kind of work you are
                    going to do. So when you have the basic function of political reporting taken
                    away from you, or denied you, because of the structure of things, it is really
                    rather disappointing. I tried very hard to make myself “relevant”. I was never,
                    never formally presented to the Premier of the Province of Quebec, in spite of
                    the fact that I asked for appointments on several occasions. I met all of the
                    other cabinet members in Quebec and was treated very nicely. They have the
                    tradition that, when a new Principal Officer comes to the province, the office
                    of protocol takes you up to visit Parliament. You sit in the gallery at the
                    Parliament, you're acknowledged by the Speaker of the Parliament, and they even
                    give you a little video tape of that event. They were charming and very
                    considerate. Obviously, Qu�b�cois understand the United States and Americans
                    very, very well. We're practically one country. We don't know them, but they
                    know us very well. So it's not exactly like dealing with a Third World
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>I understood this situation very quickly, after a couple of months, when I
                    discovered that I was never going to be able to formally meet the Premier of
                    Quebec, even though most of the time the Premier lived in Montreal. His home was
                    actually in Montreal. Many of the political figures had to commute between
                    Quebec City and Montreal, a three hour drive each way.</p>
                <p>I took on other projects. Aside from the management of the post, I tried to
                    become involved and, as I said, to be relevant, politically. Montreal is a very
                    ethnically diverse city. As I am a Greek-American, I was, of course, readily and
                    happily accepted by the very large Greek community in Montreal. There are over
                    80,000 Greek Canadians there. The Lebanese community was also very sympathetic
                    and understanding. There is even a Kurdish community which would invite me to
                    their national day of commemoration of what the Turks had done to them in 1915.
                    Anybody who had ever, or whose family had ever been colonized by the Turks was
                    very welcome.</p>
                <p>I also became very involved in the functions of the Consular Corps, because that
                    appeared to be something that was useful to do, since the Consular Corps
                    basically was run, master-minded, and dictated to by the Honorary Austrian
                    Consul, who happened to drop dead the month after I got to Montreal. As the
                    Consular Corps struggled to reconstitute itself, I became very involved with
                    trying to refashion it to something which would be more useful to the
                    professional diplomats and also to give us a way to talk to the Provincial
                    Government.</p>
                <p>Every government treats honorary consuls differently. In the case of the Province
                    of Quebec, because the “separatist,” Parti Qu�b�cois government was looking for
                    more international acceptance, it had tended to give much more authority and
                    privileges to the honorary consuls than I had experienced at other posts. They
                    were even accorded “duty free” importation privileges and Consular Corps license
                    plates for their cars. The career consuls objected to this sort of treatment
                    because the non-career consuls don't have the same responsibilities as the
                    career consuls. Anyway, that was a “hobby horse” that I was able to ride and be
                    involved with. At least, it allowed me to “mix” with my colleagues in a
                    constructive fashion.</p>
                <p>I became very friendly with the Russians. The only other post that the Russians
                    had outside of Ottawa was in Montreal, which also maintained representation at
                    ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organization. This was just before the
                    breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically, you were talking about the Soviets, rather than
                        the Russians.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Initially, it was the Soviets, and then it became the Russians. But
                    before the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Consul General made it very
                    clear to me that he would like to be able to get together periodically and
                    discuss issues. Of course, this was very interesting to me, given my own 30
                    years of Cold War experience. Suddenly to be in charge of a post and to have the
                    Russians say, “Let's talk,” would be very useful, in my view, from an
                    intelligence-gathering point of view.</p>
                <p>So I asked the Embassy what they wanted me to do and how they wanted me to handle
                    this. We have had these long-standing requirements to report conversations with
                    Soviet Bloc representatives. Of course, there were other Bloc representatives in
                    Montreal: the Poles and the Czechs had consulates. The North Koreans did not.
                    The South Koreans did. The Chinese Communists eventually opened a consulate in
                    Montreal. The Cubans had a consulate there. However, I was struck by the
                    indifference of our Embassy to the whole thing. It was made rather clear to me
                    that I could do almost anything that I wanted to do. I thought that this was one
                    of the “straws in the wind” which raised the question in my mind, “What am I
                    doing here?” It was completely different from anything else that I have ever
                    experienced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I found the same thing when I was Consul General in
                        Naples. The Embassy didn't really care. It just didn't want me to cause any
                        problems and wanted me to keep out of the headlines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: This really gave me pause for thought. I realized that the Embassy
                    really didn't care what the Russians were saying in Montreal. Anyway, I
                    developed a good relationship with the Russian Consul General. We discussed
                    matters of general interest. It was interesting to watch that transition as the
                    Soviet Union broke up and how they coped with that. The Russians were really not
                    10 feet tall, after all.</p>
                <p>When one of the major GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] conferences
                    was held in Montreal at the end of 1988, it was hard for me and my team at the
                    Consulate General to play any role in that relationship, because people came
                    from Washington to deal with the various issues. We provided the delegation with
                    some transportation and escort service, but there was no real way to get
                    involved in this kind of thing.</p>
                <p>I wondered how I was going to “cover myself with glory” and, in fact, “make a
                    difference.” I was still in the FEOC. I needed a promotion to MC [Minister
                    Counselor]. Obviously, I would have to “shine” as Principal Officer. The
                    question was, how do you do that?</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>I thought that one way I could do this was in the management of the post. One of
                    the requirements that developed was that we had to move out of the existing
                    office facilities and move into new, specifically-designed and constructed
                    facilities, as a result of what had happened at other posts in terms of
                    protecting them against terrorist attacks. The Department decided that, although
                    we would have liked to remain where we were, there was a problem with the
                    security of our office building. The building we were in was basically part of a
                    shopping center—a large, high-rise office building and shopping center. The
                    owners of the building objected to our “bricking up” the windows, for example.
                    They allowed us to put vehicle barriers out in front so that a “suicide bomber”
                    couldn't crash a car into the Consular Section on the ground floor. However, the
                    Consular Section was vulnerable if someone decided to blow up a car in front of
                    the building.</p>
                <p>The Department eventually was able to negotiate a lease on space in another
                    high-rise building, two blocks away and closer to the center of Montreal. We
                    were allowed to redesign two of the top two floors of that high-rise building
                    for new Consulate General offices. I had a lot of input into designing that
                    facility, given the structure that we had. We had two floors, plus the basement,
                    to work with. What we clearly had to consider was how to handle the flow of visa
                    applicants. We had several hundred visa applicants per day. It was nothing like
                    the Embassies in Seoul or Manila, but still a busy place in a very tough
                    climate. So that was an interesting challenge for my first year in Montreal. I
                    helped to design the facilities and to negotiate the lease, plus working with
                    the contractor to set up a “hard line” and figure out what space we should
                    have.</p>
                <p>The chief of the Consular Section, who, I guess, still resented the fact that I
                    hadn't selected him to be my deputy, tried to pull a “fast one,” communicating
                    directly with the Department about his desire to have his own conference room in
                    his section. He did not even tell me about it. The Department actually put that
                    idea into the plan, based on his conversations with people in Washington. I came
                    down on him like a ton of bricks. We were going to have a nicely-appointed
                    conference room which everybody would be able to use.</p>
                <p>I had other designs for space that would be available. For example, VIP [Very
                    Important Person] quarters for the Ambassador, who would come down to Montreal
                    from time to time. We had had U. S. cabinet and sub-cabinet officers come to the
                    post, but there had been no appropriate space to put these people. We had a
                    visit from the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy. I had no suitable
                    place to put him and his staff, outside of giving him my own office. So I
                    created a VIP office suite. It worked out fairly well.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>Eventually, we managed to move into the new offices in the spring of 1990. During
                    the move we were only closed to the public for two or three days. We were able
                    to move everything and still get into action quickly. There was money to build
                    the place but no money for curtains or signs. We didn't even have money to make
                    signs as to where the visa lines were supposed to be. We had paper signs all
                    over the place. It looked a little “tacky,” initially. Nevertheless, the move
                    was relatively painless because we planned and worked it out in advance.
                    Everybody cooperated in the move.</p>
                <p>Two weeks after we moved the Foreign Service Inspectors showed up. I had planned
                    for the arrival of the inspectors, although this was my first experience with
                    the “new” Inspection Corps—that is, the post-1987, Jesse Helms inspired,
                    Inspection Corps. Inspections were no longer under the control of the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One felt that it was an adverbial process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I discovered this painfully afterwards. Up until that experience, I'd
                    been inspected probably at seven different posts during my career. I'd worked as
                    a TDY [Temporary Duty] consular inspector in China. I thought I understood how
                    the inspection system works. I had learned about the system from contact with
                    inspectors on a number of occasions who were thoughtful and helpful to me. I had
                    no real fear of the inspectors. You try to do the best job you know how to do,
                    under the circumstances. If you make mistakes, OK, you make mistakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And also they can put in a word for you, saying, “He
                        really needs this or that.” They can suggest ways of straightening things
                        out if there are problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I've described to you my experience in the Bahamas. It was the same
                    kind of thing. The inspectors said that I needed more administrative people and
                    all of that.</p>
                <p>The inspectors were going all over Canada, because there are four or five posts
                    involved. I talked on the telephone to the senior officer leading the team which
                    was going to inspect the Consulate General in Montreal and worked out the
                    schedule. One of the things you need to work out are the ground rules, what kind
                    of representational functions I would plan to demonstrate the depth of our
                    contacts, the kind of people we knew, and what was going on in the post. I had
                    known this senior inspector because I had replaced him at a previous post. We
                    weren't friends, but we were acquainted with each other and, I thought, had a
                    fairly amicable relationship. He was a very competent officer, who since has
                    died, but I won't mention his name.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>I guess I should have gotten a clue when he told me that basically all of the
                    plans were fine but he didn't want a lot of representational functions. He
                    suggested an initial dinner reception for the section chiefs at the residence
                    the first night that they were in Montreal. He said that they didn't want any
                    other representational functions, although they would like to go to a couple of
                    baseball games. It was spring, and the Montreal Expos were playing major league
                    baseball. The inspectors were going to be in Montreal for two weeks, but they
                    really didn't want any representational functions put on for them. That should
                    have tipped me off that there was something very different going on. Why would
                    inspectors come to a constituent post for two weeks? All of my experience had
                    been that the inspection of Embassies took two weeks, but not a constituent
                    post. They were going to inspect the Consulate in Halifax before coming to
                    Montreal, so maybe they were going to write their report on Halifax while they
                    were in Montreal. So perhaps that was why they needed the extra time.</p>
                <p>No, that wasn't it. They sent us a flock of questionnaires that everyone was
                    supposed to fill out, which we dutifully did. I gave the requisite lecture to
                    the staff, Americans and locals, instructing everyone to tell the inspectors
                    whatever was on their minds and answer candidly whatever questions they might
                    have.</p>
                <p>It had been my practice in Montreal, building on the experience of my
                    predecessor, to hold two staff meetings a week for the American staff. There had
                    long been a weekly staff meeting for the American staff—early in the morning on
                    Fridays, as I recall. I found that this was really a problem for the Consular
                    Section because their public was waiting for them in line...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not the same thing as with a Political Section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: I was very conscious of the fact that I would be talking, other people
                    would be “gassing,” the public was waiting, and these guys in the Consular
                    Section were going to have to work through lunch to get through their workload.
                    You always have to be aware of the pressures that they are under. At the same
                    time, you don't want to leave them out. We had two junior officers in the
                    Consular Section. Inevitably, they were torn between priorities. How do you deal
                    with this problem? I also had to hold my staff meeting at a time when the
                    morning telegrams hadn't been processed yet. I hadn't even read them. I couldn't
                    even tell people what was in the morning cables.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>I decided to have a second staff meeting on another day of the week for all of
                    the section chiefs, including USIA [United States Information Agency
                    representative], the commercial officer, and a DEA, Drug Enforcement
                    Administration, representative. We also had a representative of the Department
                    of Agriculture, from the Grain Testing Service, because of the grain storage
                    facilities in use in connection with the St. Lawrence Seaway. I also invited the
                    U. S. representative to ICAO to come over—either he himself or his State
                    Department political officer—to sit in on those sessions, just to “plug in” to
                    what was going on. This was unique, because it had not been done before. The
                    ICAO staff had always been separate. They were basically friendly, but
                    apparently we had always stayed at a distance from each other. I was interested
                    in what ICAO was doing and was looking for something to be involved in. So I
                    would have what I called my “Country Team Meeting” and then would have a staff
                    meeting for all members of the American staff.</p>
                <p>So there were two American staff meetings per week. One of the problems I faced
                    when I first came to Montreal was with the local employees. The Foreign Service
                    local employees in Canada are very vocal. They're probably the most vocal, local
                    employees in the world, because Canadians don't view themselves as anybody's
                    employee. They are your equal.</p>
                <p>Anyway, just after I arrived in Montreal the local employees had been very
                    disappointed over the decision by the Embassy not to accord them a cost of
                    living increase which they regarded as due them. This had transpired because in
                    several previous cycles an Administrative Officer in the Embassy had
                    unilaterally granted them increases in salary over and above what they should
                    have received under the schedule approved by Washington. He did this because he
                    wanted to be a “good fellow.” Well, to pay Peter, you have to take it away from
                    Paul, so to speak. It had come out that this Administrative Officer had done
                    this on his own responsibility, so the Department, in effect, was “docking” the
                    wages of the local employees.</p>
                <p>This angered the local employees, and they asked to talk to me about that. So,
                    just after I arrived in Montreal I had a meeting with them along with my
                    Administrative Officer. There was just one Administrative Officer at post, as
                    was the case in the Bahamas. I met with the local employees and heard them out.
                    I told them, “Look, I can't do very much to solve this problem, and neither can
                    the Embassy. This was dictated by events which took place previously and was a
                    Washington level decision. I understand that and I want you to know that I
                    sympathize with you.” I took the occasion to tell all of the Consulate General's
                    local employees that I was going to follow an “open door” policy. I understood
                    the difficulties resulting from the fact that initially there were 12 floors
                    between most of the local employees and my office. Furthermore, there were
                    several locked doors to go through. I said that I realized that it was not easy
                    for a local employee to go and see the “boss” to talk about problems. However, I
                    wanted to let them know that I understood the “peer pressures” that go on. I was
                    going to encourage them to try to talk to management.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>The way I would do that is that I would have a meeting periodically—say, once
                    every two or three weeks—with the local employees. Myself alone—no other
                    American from the Consulate General. Obviously, we couldn't take everybody away
                    from work to do that, but I wanted each unit from the whole office to send a
                    representative to these meetings. Actually, the local staff was largely made up
                    of USIS and State Department local employees. I said, “I want you to select a
                    representative from each unit who will come in and talk to me. You can empower
                    that person to tell me what your problems are. I will tell you what I think
                    about this and I will tell you about other issues. We can try to create a 'flow
                    of information back and forth.'”</p>
                <p>I found this practice useful. It lowered the temperature, to some extent. It
                    reduced the level of rancor that was felt. But it wasn't until the inspection
                    that I appreciated how many problems there were at this post. The point of all
                    this is that I made it my business to create a lot of “flows of information.” Of
                    course, there were other, more informal things that I did, like “trooping the
                    line”—walking the “trench line,” a policy which I had followed at other posts
                    where I had served and had a supervisory responsibility. I also invited some of
                    our local employees to the residence.</p>
                <p>Various Principal Officers have used their residences in different ways. My
                    predecessor had worked very hard to get money out of the Department to refurbish
                    the residence, because it had “run down” over the years. I knew several of my
                    predecessors as Principal Officer in Montreal. In fact, I think that I knew all
                    of them, with one exception, dating back 30 years. You know some of them, as
                    well. Many of them didn't want to entertain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Montreal is a “retirement post.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: It's a “retirement post,” a “golden hand shake post.” Many of them
                    thought that they weren't going to break their backs bringing people in to
                    entertain them. Many of my predecessors did their official entertaining at
                    restaurants or at a club. There was a club in Montreal that the Consular Corps
                    used a great deal for entertaining. There was no lack of places where you could
                    entertain. However, I felt that the U. S. Government had spent all of this
                    money, refurbishing the house and so forth, so why not use it for entertainment
                    purposes? It was a nice house, and we had household staff to serve. My wife and
                    I happen to like to entertain people. It's part of the pleasure that we got out
                    of the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>So I tried to include not only the junior officers but also local staff members.
                    I had Christmas parties, for example, at the residence. I had known of Principal
                    Officers at that post who had never even invited local staff members into the
                    house.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>I used all of these various ways of getting people to talk, to open up, and to be
                    accessible, which I figured was the name of the game. The other aspect is that I
                    don't think that you should look at a place like Montreal and say, “This is a
                    problem post.” This was not a “problem” part of the world. Montreal is a very
                    nice town. The functions at the post are primarily routine, and it's a routine
                    kind of Foreign Service post. We did our work, and the biggest problem was the
                    climate for a few months of the year. The people who live in the Province of
                    Quebec solve that too, by going “underground”—staying out of the weather. Nobody
                    really suffers terribly in a place like Montreal and nobody really has any basis
                    for complaint. I've been to some of the really “crappy” places in the Foreign
                    Service. While I was not particularly “relaxed,” or “blas�", I took my
                    responsibilities seriously. I did not feel that anybody had any particular
                    reason for complaint.</p>
                <p>I was concerned, for example, about what we could do for the junior officers. In
                    Seoul I had had eight junior officers to deal with. How do you supervise these
                    guys so that they are not “burned out”? I mean, “burned out” and disgusted with
                    the consular function, if they are treated like galley slaves. How do you do
                    that, particularly when the work has to be done? There is a given amount of work
                    to be done and statutory responsibilities which we have to perform. Still, I
                    thought, with a little “give and take” and a little imagination, maybe we can do
                    something to broaden their horizons.</p>
                <p>For example, I pushed to arrange for one of the junior officers to spend some
                    time working with the Economic Officer—a few hours a day, just so that he'd have
                    something else to think about. He was an economic cone officer and wanted to be
                    able to do something else beside consular work in the Foreign Service. It was
                    like pulling teeth to get the Consul to agree with this, but that's the sort of
                    thing that I did.</p>
                <p>If Quebec City, for example, which is just a two-man post, had a problem because
                    they ran out of people—one man was on leave or the other guy was sick or had a
                    family emergency of some kind—I would send somebody up there to help to hold the
                    fort. I didn't send a supervisor. I would send a junior officer up there. I
                    would say, “This is what I did 25 years before. The way to learn how things are
                    done is to jump into the deep end of the pool. So go up to Quebec City and help
                    to manage the place.” I felt that I was doing my duty by doing this. I'm telling
                    you all this because of what happened as a result of the inspection.</p>
                <p>The inspectors came in, and I found that out of the five inspectors, only one or
                    two had previously been in the Foreign Service. Most of the inspectors had
                    primarily auditor type experience. They had worked in other agencies of the
                    government, such as the Defense Department, for example. As I said, this was my
                    first experience with the new type of inspection, which the new Inspector
                    General set up in the Department. Previously, the Inspector General had always
                    been a very senior Foreign Service Officer—an Ambassador, for example. The new
                    Inspector General of the Department came from outside the Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>So we went through this drill. The inspectors handed out their questionnaires and
                    went around and talked to everybody on the staff. Of course, I tried to be as
                    helpful as I could with them.</p>
                <p>The team leader came into my office one morning the day I was having a reception
                    for the Consular Corps, city leaders, and other notables to cut the ribbon for
                    opening our new offices. I had invited the Ambassador down from Ottawa to
                    preside with me and I got the Mayor of Montreal to come over. Nobody from the
                    Provincial Government showed up, which didn't surprise me. I had my household
                    staff prepare the food. We didn't have to cater it. It was a very nice
                    reception.</p>
                <p>The wine industry in the United States was pressing very hard to persuade the
                    Qu�b�cois to open up the wine market. The French had had this market pretty well
                    “sewed up.” The American wine industry had a hard time selling wine in Canada.
                    What the American vintners would do would be to sponsor a wine exhibition. Over
                    the years we had accumulated a fairly large “wine cellar” of excess wine, under
                    the care and keeping of the Consulate General. We would use some of this wine
                    for representational functions. I tried to keep very careful control over it,
                    because I was afraid of a scandal developing over what had happened to all of
                    that “free” wine from the American wine industry. Anyway, there was plenty of
                    wine available for a function like this one, for the July 4 celebration, and
                    other things that we would do.</p>
                <p>As I said, the senior inspector came in to see me on the morning of that
                    reception. I will never forget that date or the experience of it until the day I
                    die. He looked at me with a very sad face and said, “I'm sorry to report to you,
                    but you've got a very unhappy post, a post that's in trouble.” I tell you, I was
                    so shocked that I was speechless. Then he went on to describe all of the
                    statistics which the inspectors had collected from the questionnaires and from
                    the confidential interviews with the employees at the post. I was absolutely
                    dumbfounded. Of course, I realized immediately that my career had ended that day
                    and that I was “finished” in the Foreign Service. I remember sitting in my chair
                    as if somebody had hit me with a two-by-four. I just couldn't believe what the
                    man said. Groggily I thought that, if I could have gotten away with it, I would
                    have canceled that stupid reception.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>The date was early June. We had the reception. I made a speech in French. The
                    Mayor of Montreal, the Ambassador, and everybody else had a great time. They all
                    thought that it was a wonderful office “layout.” They thought that we had done a
                    marvelous job of outfitting the Consulate General. We took our guests on tours
                    of the facilities. I know that the inspectors were dumbfounded by what they saw.
                    I recovered my public persona pretty well. I decided that I would not go out
                    “feet first” but would go out as a professional. I thought that I had obviously
                    failed and that it was the end of my career. I thought that I would not be
                    promoted again. I needed to be promoted or I would be retired for having
                    exceeded the allowed “time in grade.” I thought that I would go out with the
                    knowledge that I was probably the only FEOC who served his whole time in class
                    doing jobs rated at the highest level and didn't get promoted, which takes a lot
                    of doing. But there it was. I was angry about this whole thing.</p>
                <p>I remember that, as we went through the process of “negotiating” what the
                    inspectors' report would say, we had a lot of angry meetings with them. I felt
                    “betrayed” by something, that I'd been “sandbagged,” but I couldn't figure out
                    what had happened. I didn't understand what had happened to me. Of course, the
                    Ambassador felt humiliated by this. He had given me a good Efficiency Report,
                    which the DCM had drafted. I felt that my management skills had been quite “up
                    to the task” and that I had done very well. But here I came out of the
                    inspection with the reputation that we had a “shoddy” shop. This was absolutely
                    not the case.</p>
                <p>During the summer of 1990 I obviously thought about this a great deal. I “stewed”
                    in this. That was the summer when we had the great “Indian uprising” in the
                    Montreal area. You may remember it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. They were blocking roads and bridges...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The key bridge across the St. Lawrence River was blocked by the Mohawk
                    Indians of the area, which almost caused bloodshed. The commuters were pretty
                    sore about it. It was like having the Indians take over the 14th St. Bridge in
                    Washington. Imagine what would happen in Washington, D. C., if somebody did
                    that. It was kind of interesting to report on that because I happened to know
                    the Mayor of the little town on the other side of that bridge. He was one of the
                    people I had gotten to know. I went around and met the mayors in the various
                    towns in my consular district. I talked to him on the phone. They had the
                    Canadian Army out there, the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police], and the
                    provincial police. It was kind of like reporting on a war zone. I enjoyed
                    writing little telegrams about this.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>We also had the only military ship visit during my tour of duty in Montreal. I
                    think that the name of the ship was the USS AUBREY FITCH, one of the frigates
                    which had supported our efforts in Grenada, when I was charg� d'affaires there.
                    I had gone on board this ship as charg�. [The AUBREY FITCH is a Guided Missile
                    Frigate of the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class.] They had given me a hat to
                    commemorate the occasion. When the ship came through Montreal, it was going down
                    to the Great Lakes and then coming back. We were discussing by phone a joint
                    reception which we would have on board the ship. The ship made its way through
                    the St. Lawrence Seaway, right at the time of this Indian uprising. The captain
                    was concerned. So when they were going through the Seaway, they “buttoned the
                    ship up” [went to General Quarters].</p>
                <p>The Executive Officer of the ship, with whom I was in telephone contact, said
                    that he flew the biggest American flag that he could find. There was nobody on
                    deck when they went through the locks. There was a Mohawk Indian out there in
                    camouflage uniform. I don't remember whether he was carrying an AK-47 automatic
                    rifle. He might have been carrying a U. S. Marine flag. It was obviously
                    somebody who had served in the U. S. Marines. The Mohawk Indians are allowed to
                    cross the U. S.-Canadian border without any immigration formalities. Many of
                    them served in the U. S. military. I think that he gestured to the ship and
                    said, “Shell Montreal, shell Montreal!” I put that in a reporting cable to the
                    Embassy to “lighten up” the situation.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of fun at the reception on board the ship. I was treated very nicely
                    by the ship's officers. I have an plaque which they gave me, saying that I am an
                    “Honorary Fitchman,” because I had been on board the ship in Grenada and now in
                    Montreal.</p>
                <p>But over the summer of 1990 I “stewed” in this humiliating experience of the
                    inspection. The Ambassador was required to come down and “read us the riot act.”
                    I had to sit there and listen to him go on with all of this jazz.</p>
                <p>I decided to engage a lawyer and said to him, “I'd like you to find out what
                    happened to me in this inspection.” He came to Montreal and, in fact, inspected
                    the inspection. By that time I had figured out who was on my side and who had
                    probably participated in “hanging” me in this “lynching.” Based on my
                    recommended list of local and American employees of the Consulate General in
                    Montreal, the lawyer interviewed a lot of people. He came up with enough
                    written, sworn statements which indicated that there had been a conspiracy to
                    “sandbag” me in the inspection.</p>
                <p>This conspiracy had been orchestrated by several people in the Consulate General.
                    These people apparently had reason to dislike me. They persuaded two of the
                    junior officers and several others to say things to the inspectors about my
                    management of the post and to make comments on the questionnaires. Of course,
                    the questionnaires were shredded as soon as they were reviewed, so there was no
                    way to find out who said what.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>For example, the minute that the inspectors learned that the DEA representative
                    had nothing but good things to say about me, they never went back and talked to
                    him. I learned this from the Drug Enforcement officer who spoke to my lawyer.
                    Based on these sworn statements, it was clear that the inspectors would bring a
                    person in for an interview and say, “Now, tell me what the Consul General is
                    doing now, or did, or whatever. None of this is going out of this room, and your
                    name is never going to be mentioned. Just tell me what he is up to.</p>
                <p>I had thought initially that the local employees of the Consulate General were at
                    the bottom of this. I never suspected that the Americans were involved. In point
                    of fact the local employees, if not neutral about me, were complimentary. There
                    were between 18 and 20 Americans assigned to Montreal. 18 questionnaires were
                    collected and analyzed. If you have six or eight people who put you at the
                    bottom of the list, it's going to bring the entire score down. It's going to
                    “skew” the results. I don't know whether or not the inspectors were instructed
                    to “get” me because I had allegedly done something “wrong” in Seoul but couldn't
                    prove it. But they may have wanted to make sure that I was never promoted.
                    Again, I don't know if that happened or not. People could go to their graves and
                    never admit it. You could hypothesize, but basically, if you can “skew” that
                    score, why didn't the inspectors say, “Hey, wait a minute. There's a real range
                    of opinion here about what happened in the Consulate General in Montreal. This
                    post has just moved into new quarters. It is in a bit of an uproar, and there
                    are these other problems with Canadian posts, because of local dissatisfaction.”
                    And so on. None of that was ever mentioned as mitigating factors. Basically, the
                    inspectors came in with an agenda, and then they decided that somebody was going
                    to get it “in the neck.”</p>
                <p>The other issue that had a lot of bearing on what happened to me, is that the
                    courts found against the Department in terms of the women's class action suit.
                    This was the suit brought by several hundred women who said that they had been
                    systematically deprived of assignments and awards and had been discriminated
                    against by male Foreign Service Officers. As you know, that had been fought by
                    the Department for a long time—10 years. Finally a woman judge in the Appeals
                    Court told the Department that she had found against it and told the Department
                    to promote 300 women into the Senior Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>You don't have to be a personnel genius to figure out what has to happen in that
                    sort of situation. In fact, if you had the problem, and were told that there are
                    600 or 700 people in the Senior Foreign Service, and then were told to promote
                    300 other people, how do you do that, without creating circumstances leading to
                    another class action suit? You could have people saying, “Hey, I've just been
                    forced to 'walk the plank' here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>I think that, basically, the Department decided that it had to “get rid of” a
                    certain type of officer. Men coming near retirement who had done all right and
                    were senior officers. However, it is necessary to make room, somehow. You can't
                    “buy” people out and you can't say this openly. If you say it openly, you'll
                    have a class action suit that will rock the whole of foggy bottom. I believe
                    that the system decided that it was going to be necessary to get rid of a number
                    of people. It's clear that anybody who was a supervisor was fair game, because
                    you can go into any operation, anywhere in the federal government—and
                    particularly in the State Department or Foreign Service—and find something
                    “wrong.” If you are out to “get” somebody, you can “get” somebody. That's a
                    cliche, but I think that it's absolutely true. I think that that's what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>I don't even take all of this personally. I think that they said, “Antippas fits
                    the profile—59 years old, white, male, he's out.” This came to me in a blinding
                    “flash” in 1990. I couldn't figure out what had happened. I guess that I'd been
                    out of the Department so long that I hadn't realized what had happened. I knew
                    about the female-male conflict. In fact, I even knew the woman who precipitated
                    all of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alison Palmer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: Alison Palmer. We were all in Vietnam together, right? I was in Seoul
                    on vacation in 1990. After this Mohawk Indian incident in Montreal I decided to
                    take some time off. I went to Seoul for a vacation.</p>
                <p>While I was in Seoul, I did two things. First, I called on the president of
                    Korean Airlines [KAL], an old friend of the Embassy. He had worked as a
                    contractor for the U. S. forces in Vietnam and is a person I had a lot of
                    contact with at the time because, obviously, KAL needed a lot of help from the
                    Consular Section. We had a good relationship. I went to see him to say hello. He
                    said to me, “What is this about the State Department Inspector General's Corps?
                    When I was in New York last spring [1989], I was interviewed by two
                    investigators who came to my daughter's apartment in New York. They asked
                    questions about you. They wanted to know if I'd given you free airline tickets
                    at any time.” He continued, “I told them that we had dealings with each other
                    because that was our respective jobs. However, I'd never given you free tickets.
                    If you want to look at my records, I'd be happy to let you do that.” He said,
                    “What the hell is going on with these people?”</p>
                <p>I was really shocked when I heard that. Here they were approaching a private
                    Korean citizen in the United States. I also read the “Asian Wall Street Journal”
                    or, rather, the Asian edition of the “Herald Tribune”, during the time I was
                    there in Seoul. There was a column in it written by William Safire, in which
                    Safire described what the FBI was doing to people in their investigations. Do
                    you remember our colleague who was the Assistant Secretary of State for Security
                    at the time the story broke about the DCM in Vienna [Felix Bloch], who allegedly
                    passed secrets to the Soviets?</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You remember the Assistant Secretary, because he was head of the
                    Passport Office at one time. He was apparently under consideration to be
                    appointed Ambassador to Cyprus. His appointment was held up. Apparently, he had
                    taken a polygraph at the time of this investigation of this situation with the
                    DCM in Vienna. There had been a “blip” on his polygraph. Because of that the FBI
                    wouldn't give him a clearance. They left the file “open”. Because the file was
                    open, he couldn't be appointed. However, Senator Sarbanes [Democrat, Maryland]
                    very much wanted him to go to Cyprus and pushed the FBI into “putting up or
                    shutting up.”</p>
                <p>That was what Safire's column was about. How the FBI “punishes” people by keeping
                    the file of their background investigation open. This hit me like a blinding
                    flash of light. This was something that I hadn't “understood” previously. I said
                    to myself, “This is what happened. This is where the system has changed.” In the
                    old days it was more of a gentlemen's organization. There could be accusations
                    and suspicions, yes. That's the name of the game. We've had that since the
                    beginning of the Republic. People have been accused of malfeasance or whatever.
                    However, as I understood the system from my own, personal experience, if they
                    didn't have a case to make, they closed the file on an investigation. They may
                    have made a mark somewhere else that never saw the light of day until later on.
                    However, the fact was that if they didn't have a case, they closed the file
                    after a decent interval, and people got on with their lives. What has changed is
                    the nature of this “beast.” The other development which led me to this
                    conclusion is what happened within the Inspector General's organization itself.
                    It grew. They...</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: They brought in investigators, auditors, they quadrupled the staff. I
                    don't know. I have these figures somewhere. Somebody said at one point that the
                    Inspector General's Office spent $60 million to collect $30 million.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: You justify your existence by the number of cases you can make out. How
                    do we do our “consular packages?” We do it by workload, right? And the number of
                    cases that you have open, which may never be resolved...</p>

                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>ANTIPPAS: The reason why I'm going through all of this in excruciating detail—I'm
                    not trying to make a legal brief out of it—is that it shows you what happened to
                    the Foreign Service because of that. What are the implications of this, once it
                    gets to be known that the Inspector General's basic function is to “terrorize”?
                    What does this mean for people who are expected to be senior officers, to show
                    initiative, to make decisions—especially if you're the boss? It means that
                    anybody who has his own agenda can “take you out,” and you don't have any legal
                    recourse. When did I surrender my civil rights when I became a federal
                    employee?</p>
