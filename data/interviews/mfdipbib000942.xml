                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Ms. Potts]</p>
                <p>Q: This is an interview with Bertha Potts, who likes to be known as “Bert” Potts,
                    a retired Foreign Service officer who served all of her career with the United
                    States Information Agency (USIA). Bert could you tell us where and when you were
                    born?</p>
                <p>POTTS: I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 26th day oDecember,
                    1915.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: In Redwood City, California, which is about half way betweeSan Francisco
                    and San Jose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us a little bit about your mother and
                        father anyour family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: My mother and father were not educated people. My grandfather had
                    apparently walked out on Grandmother and left her destitute, so my mother did
                    the usual nine years of education and then went out to work as a salesgirl in a
                    department store. My dad, I have no idea what his education was, was born in
                    Trinidad, Colorado where his father was into mining. When Dad was about two or
                    three, the family moved to Los Angeles where my father was raised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I had the standard education of the period. There was not a mid or winter
                    semester so if you were supposed to be going to high school at that point you
                    were expected to do the first year in six months. So I did three and a half
                    years of high school. I was out of high school when I was 16 and a half years
                    old.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From there what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I went right on to college, San Jose State college. I got mdegree by the
                    time I was 20.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: In speech, communication and theater. I got out in the middle of the
                    depression and couldn't get a job, so I went back for a fifth year and qualified
                    as a teacher at the elementary level, but never got a job below the seventh
                    grade. My first job was teaching the seventh grade in the school I graduated
                    from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: That would have been 1937. I taught there for six years, interrupted by
                    the year 1941-42 when I went to Connecticut on a teacher exchange. I was in
                    Connecticut at the time of Pearl Harbor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war came along and I believe you became a member of
                        the WACS.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: That is true. I couldn't wait to join. I wanted to join so badly but when
                    I returned home from that exchange in 1942, I could not get out of my teaching
                    contract. So, I had to teach the 1942-43 school year. I was actually sworn into
                    the military service in January or February of 1943 on delayed orders which
                    meant they would give me a call-up when my school was out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you sworn in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: In San Francisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>POTTS: Once I finally got into the service, they gave me one week and I was on
                    the train to Fort Des Moines, Iowa for four weeks of basic training. Then they
                    gave me an assignment on the post which was a clerk-typist position and very
                    boring. I remember batting out Thanksgiving menus on a hot day in July. There
                    was a lot of rumor running around the post concerning postings if one didn'have
                    any foreign born grandparents, and since all of mine were born abroad I
                    naturally thought this wasn't going to apply to me at all. But, I was told to
                    report to a certain officer which I did. He said, “This is the first and only
                    time in your military career when you are going to have a chance to say 'yes' or
                    'no.' I am going to ask you if you want this assignment.” He didn't ask me about
                    foreign grandparents at all. I said, “How will this affect my application for
                    officer candidate school? I very much want to be an officer.” He said, “Forget
                    it. If you take this job all those papers will be thrown out and you will have
                    to start over again because that is another military district, Washington,
                    DC.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the job he was offering you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: He wasn't very specific. He only said that it was in the intelligence
                    division. I said, “no” because I did not want to lose my chance to go to officer
                    candidate school and assumed I had lost the job. Ten days later the orders were
                    on my desk. The man lied from day one. Obviously he had no intention of telling
                    me the truth. I had been chosen by the military service to go and I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: To Washington, DC. To military intelligence at the Pentagon. I stayed
                    there until I finally got another chance to go to officer candidate school in
                    May 1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Of course. I went back to Fort Des Moines, Iowa and took my 12 weeks of
                    officer school and got my 2nd lieutenant's commission and the war was over in
                    three weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Until April 30, 1946. I only got out because somebodoffered me a Civil
                    Service job in the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were stationed in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>POTTS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to military intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes. That was the agreement on the part of my colonel if hlet me go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this give you some interest in Foreign Service work,
                        being iWashington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Of course. You get deeply involved in it. While I was in this Civil
                    Service job, which was primarily in the intelligence field, I got to know all
                    the people in naval intelligence and some of the other people involved. They got
                    me an interview to see a lady who said she might be interested in my serving
                    abroad. So, I went to see this lady and she said, “Are you a bilingual
                    librarian?” I said that I was a teacher not a librarian. She said, “Thank you
                    very much. Good afternoon.” The next day the phone rang and she said she would
                    like me to come back again. On the second interview she suggested that if I got
                    French, at my own expense, to where I could speak it, she could somehow change
                    the title of librarian to some other kind of title, which she was prepared to
                    do. So, I went to Berlitz, having the GI Bill, and took 100 hours of French
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in Washington, DC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes. I was just about at the end of the 100 hours of conversational French
                    when I went to the movies with my French teacher and got back and found my
                    orders on the table. I called the next day, since it was too late that night, to
                    accept.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The orders were to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: For Saigon, which is where I wanted to go. But, when I called she said,
                    “Sorry, the orders have been changed since we mailed them to you. Your orders
                    will be for Bangkok.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you had studied French at Berlitz for a 100
                        hours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: That is right. I said that I wasn't sure I wanted to go to Bangkok. She
                    said, “Maybe you better go and talk it over with your colleagues in the office.”
                    So, I talked it over with my colleagues in the office and they said, “Go, Bert,
                    go. Take it, it might be a foot in the door.” So, I accepted my orders and went
                    to Bangkok in 1950.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at the embassy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: No, I was always in the United States Information Service (USIS). In 1950
                    USIS was still a part of the State Department. It did not become a separate
                    agency until 1953.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I did primarily exchange of persons. I worked on the language and speak a
                    little Thai. I was too stubborn to do it the modern way. I think the first
                    sentence I learned to put together was not “Good evening, Mr. Ambassador. How
                    are you?” but “The water buffalo is in the middle of the rice field.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the title of your job in Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Assistant cultural affairs officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the name of the public affairs officer
                        (PAO) othe ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: The ambassador was Edwin F. Stanton. I'm not sure who was the first PAO,
                    but the second PAO was George Helyer, who disliked me intensely, and told me
                    so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too bad. How long did you spend in Bangkok?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Just two years. Then I got the orders to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you still remember your 100 hours of Berlitz
                        French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I had to do a little review which I did in Redwood City on home leave with
                    my mother. I found a student at Stanford University who helped me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1952 or 1953?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: This was 1952. I spent 1952-54 in Saigon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before any real buildup of our forces in

                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Oh, yes. We were not involved at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was at the time of the French debacle there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes, and I was there at the time of Dien Bien Phu. I was there the day we
                    were all assigned to go down to the docks where people were coming off ships,
                    the great exodus from the north. We were given tins of milk to hand to the
                    people and were asked to give them only to the elderly, pregnant women or little
                    children.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a consulate there, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: A consulate general. The consul general and his consucouldn't stand us.
                    They didn't like the PAO and didn't like me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the PAO, if I may ask?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: The PAO was Edward Murphy who was the most wonderful man andear friend of
                    mine, who died a few years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do in Lyon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>POTTS: I was simply an assistant to the PAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A two man post, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes. For a while we did have a Foreign Service junior officer trainee. We
                    also had for a very short time when I was first there a kind of cultural
                    assistant, but she wasn't there very long. Nor was the trainee there very
                    long.</p>
                <p>It was getting along to the end of that tour, which was a bit more than two
                    years, and I had to go up to Paris for some reason or other. When I got there
                    the special assistant to Mr. Cody, who was the PAO at that time in Paris, told
                    me I was going to lunch with him today and I should go buy myself a hat. Mr.
                    Cody refused to take women to lunch who were not wearing hats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1955-56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: This is virtually 1959, we are almost at the end of my Lyon tour. Ladies
                    wore a hat to lunch, especially when they went with Mr. Cody.</p>
                <p>He said, “I have heard some good things about your work down there, Bert. Where
                    would you like to go next?” I said, “Oh, if I had my druthers, Mr. Cody, I want
                    to go to Algiers.” He said he thought that could be set up. The next thing I
                    knew I had orders to Algiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Algiers then under our embassy in France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: It was technically part of USIS Paris, but it was so isolatethat we felt
                    ourselves more a part of the consulate general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before Algiers was independent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year did you go to Algiers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I went to Algiers in 1959 when I finished my tour in Lyon. I was there
                    from 1959 to 1961, right in the heart of a shooting war. It was part of the
                    seven-year war between the Arabs and the French. Q: Why did you choose
                    Algiers?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>POTTS: I have no idea. There was just something about it thaintrigued me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wanted to see the Casbah.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Well, I suppose. I did see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you knew the war was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Oh, yes. It definitely was a shooting war and a bombing war. I lived out
                    in the country for the first year, about fifteen minuets outside the city. Then,
                    I finally got an apartment in town right in the same building as the consulate
                    general. I worked late because the job in Algiers was to make friends with the
                    people and make friends I did. I taught English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On a regular schedule or informally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Informally, but I am a professional teacher and don't have to have a
                    standard curriculum to follow. I had junior chamber of commerce people on
                    Tuesday at the cultural center. We got so friendly that we began having meetings
                    in our own homes and soon there were appetizers and then full dinners. Every
                    sixth week I had to have dinner for all of these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the public affairs officer then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Howard White.</p>
                <p>Q: Were your relations with the consul general any better than in Lyon?</p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes. We had very good relations with Freddy Lyon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Relationships often depended on the attitude of thperson
                        icharge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>POTTS: Yes. So, bombs went off and there were bodies in the street, which was not
                    a pleasant situation. I finished my tour and then begged to go home saying I was
                    ready for a stateside tour. However, I was told that USIA was not ready to send
                    me home yet. I was on home leave, and on a trip with my sister when her
                    housemate in Bakersfield, California called our hotel in Las Vegas and said, “I
                    have a telegram.” “Well, read it.” She said, “Well, I hate to open it, it is
                    addressed to Bert.” My sister said, “Open it. She has to know what it says.” She
                    opened it up and it said, “Welcome back to Southeast Asia.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it mention any particular post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: No, I found out when I made the call the next morning. I have forgotten
                    the name of the chap doing assignments at that time. I said, “All right, is it
                    Cambodia or Laos?” He said, “Why do you ask me that question?” I said, “Because
                    I have already done Vietnam and you are not going to waste my French at this
                    point.” He said, “You are right, it's Laos.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: This was 1961. I said, “What if I don't want to go to Laos?” He said,
                    “Well, you better go to Laos. We have to have single, French-speaking officers.
                    You are going to have a nice job. You are going to be cultural attach�.” So, I
                    went to Laos and had two PAOs there, Dan Moore and Gerry Gert. Jim Stoddard was
                    the deputy, I believe.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you remember who the ambassador was?</p>
                <p>POTTS: I don't remember but he spoke terrible French. [transcriber's note:
                    Winthrop Brown was ambassador 7/60-6/62 and Leonard Unger from 7/62-12/64.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the cultural attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I was the cultural attach� there, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In which city were you stationed? There were two posts

                </p>
                <p>POTTS: There were four postVientiane, the administrative capital; Louang Prabang,
                    the royal capital; Savannakhet in the middle of the country; and Pakse in
                    southern Laos.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>POTTS: We did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you stationed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I was in Vientiane where the embassy was located. LouanPrabang,
                    Savannakhet and Pakse were branches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1961?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: This was 1961 to 1963. I spent two full years to the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of work did you do in Laos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I was the cultural attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but that can cover a lot of different tasks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: We ran the libraries, did all of whatever exchange programs existed, gave
                    lectures and that kind of thing. I was not too happy there and was ready to
                    shake the dust of Laos from my feet and leave on October 1, 1963 when I finished
                    my tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I talked them into a stateside assignment in Washington. I was there from
                    1964 to 1966. I was more or less kicked around for the first six months or so
                    but during that time I managed to pass the interpreter's test in French and was
                    tapped to be a French interpreter and escort for a very senior French art
                    curator who happened to be a woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An exchange person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: She was under the leaders and specialists exchange program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You traveled around the country with her?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>POTTS: I traveled all around the country with her for 42 days. When I say 42
                    days, I don't mean six weeks, I mean 42 days. We did not have a day off. We
                    worked morning, afternoon and went to private exhibits at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she do any lecturing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: She had no English, whatsoever. The only thing in English she could say
                    was “Where is le ladies?” Why she used a masculine article with ladies I do not
                    know. Only one exciting thing happened on that tour. While in Toledo we were
                    scheduled to visit the Toledo museum. I had seen the Toledo people the night
                    before and was told to come around 11:00 because there really wasn't that much
                    to see. We showed up at 11:00, and she started looking around. I have never seen
                    a reaction quite so exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a museum was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: An art museum. This woman was an art curator. This woman went almost out
                    of her mind when she found a painting by a French impressionist named
                    Caillebotte which had been lost to everyone in France. No one in France knew
                    where that painting was and she found it in the Toledo museum. She said that he
                    would have been the greatest had he not been killed in an accident.</p>
                <p>Then she asked me why I hadn't gotten her over there earlier. This was the only
                    time she ever blamed me for anything. She said, “Try to get me six rolls of film
                    somewhere fast.”</p>
                <p>I then got assigned to the job I wanted which was working with our foreign
                    employees who came to the States for training, orientation, and to see the
                    United States. We had very good programs worked out for them. I enjoyed this
                    buhad an unsympathetic boss. By then, 1966, I had become pretty good friends
                    with the African head man at USIA and the only place I wanted to go was Morocco.
                    So, I asked Mark and he said that he thought he could fix that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Mark Lewis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: Yes, that was Mark Lewis. So, I was assigned to Rabat as English-teaching
                    officer. I had to give up my diplomatic passport which I had as cultural attach�
                    because English-teaching officers were not considered for diplomatic status. I
                    had friends who were counseling me not to give up the diplomatic passport, but I
                    wanted that job so badly that I was willing to do it. I really thoroughly,
                    thoroughly enjoyed that job. I ran a big English-teaching school.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Teaching English to Moroccans?</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the public affairs officer in Morocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>POTTS: I had three. The first one was Ned, I can't remember his last name, then
                    Dick Monsen and Bill Payeff. Bill Payeff was not very fond of Morocco and called
                    Rabat “Dogsville.” So, I stayed there through three PAOs and two cultural
                    attach�s. Ed Fairley was cultural attach� and then Margot Cutter.</p>
                <p>After three years there, I loved the job so much I wanted to come back and told
                    personnel I would be willing to stay on another couple of years. I would delay
                    my home leave and spend another couple of years in Rabat and then return home
                    and retire. But they wanted to send me back to Washington and didn't listen to
                    my request. At that point I made up my mind and said, “If that is what you want,
                    it is not what I want, so I will retire.”</p>
