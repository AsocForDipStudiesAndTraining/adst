                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 20, 1993</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 20, 1993. This is an interview with H.
                        Freeman Matthews, Jr. and will be done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Could you give me a bit,
                        more than a bit because you come from an interesting background, could you
                        tell me about your early years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: My father was also in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his field of specialty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was primarily interested in politics. At one point he was Treasury
                    Attach� in Paris, just before the war, but he was primarily in the political
                    field. He entered the foreign service in January, 1924. His first post was
                    Budapest. After about a year in Budapest, he met my mother here in this country
                    when he was on home leave. They were married a couple of months later and so
                    their first post together was Budapest. Then he was transferred to Bogota,
                    Colombia. Both of those posts were Legations in those days.</p>
                <p>I was born in Bogota on the last day in 1927. My father was sick in bed with
                    typhoid fever, the second time he'd had it; he was really right on the edge.
                    They weren't sure he was going to live. The minister was away and the only other
                    person in the Legation was somebody named “Two Quart Hoover,” who acquired the
                    name in recognition of his daily intake of alcoholic beverages. In effect, my
                    mother was the only functioning person in the Legation when I was born. I was
                    born at home, in a bed that I still own, a large sleigh bed. It's the same bed
                    my father was born in. Anyway, that's where I was born, in Bogota, Colombia. I
                    lived there till the age of about 2.</p>
                <p>Then we came back to Washington where my father was in the Latin American
                    Division from 1929 to 1933. Then we were transferred to Havana, Cuba. We were
                    there for 4 years, 1933 to 1937. Jefferson Caffery was the ambassador, and he
                    and my brother were very close friends. As I'd not been baptized before, my
                    parents asked him to be my godfather.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one of the characters of the foreign service, not
                        character, I mean a major figure in the foreign service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was extraordinary. It's a shame you never got an oral history
                    interview with him. It would have been just fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's one of the imperial Ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Right up to the very end, we would see him from time to time. He
                    retired in Rome but often he would come back here and then we would all get
                    together, my father and the Cafferys. And the tales that he would tell were
                    absolutely straight and lucid and you understood exactly what he was going
                    through. He was a man of few words, especially on paper.</p>
                <p>I remember when I first went into the foreign service, he was in Cairo. He would
                    receive a long instruction on what to do with King Farouk or Nagib or Nasser at
                    the time, and he'd send about a 2-line answer, saying that he had carried out
                    the instructions and Farouk had agreed or Nasser had agreed. None of this
                    garbage that goes on and on and on at great length as today. He was the
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>I had a very happy existence in Cuba, had my own horse, we lived out in the
                    countryside and it was a very pleasant place to grow up.</p>
                <p>There was some student unrest, those were the days when Batista was a big hero.
                    He'd thrown out Machado who had been the dictator before him. And Batista, who
                    had been a former army sergeant, was a great hero to the people because he had
                    gotten rid of the last bad guy. I remember there was one point when the
                    students—I guess they had almost universal university education, anybody who
                    wanted to could go to university—but the result was that there were a lot of
                    people with university degrees with no jobs. This led to a fair amount of
                    unrest, especially among the students. There was a lot of unhappiness and
                    naturally they directed this against the United States.</p>
                <p>We had a chauffeur that came down with us, a very fine Black-American named
                    Charles Taylor, who was our driver and he drove my father to the Embassy every
                    morning. One morning on the way back after he dropped my father off, driving
                    along the Malecon, which is the ocean- side highway in Havana, a car cut in
                    front of him and blocked him off. A couple of guys got out and one of them broke
                    the windshield with a pistol butt and said, “This is just a warning to Mr.
                    Matthews, you tell him he's got just 2 weeks to get out of town or we're going
                    to get him or his children.” Poor Charles was greatly dismayed at this, but he
                    drove on home.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>The result of that was that we had Cuban army guards on the house from then on.
                    While they were affable enough, they weren't very efficient. That was my first
                    indirect experience of terrorism. We lived in Cuba till 1937 and then we were
                    transferred to Paris.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, my father was first named the Treasury Attach� there, a
                    field that he was not particularly expert in but he did speak very good French.
                    He had studied at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris before he entered
                    the Foreign Service. In March 1939 he was sent down to Spain at the end of the
                    Civil War to become, for a very brief period, the first American representative
                    to Franco's government.</p>
                <p>I remember going down on the train alone to meet him, at the Spanish-French
                    border, with some money pinned to my underwear so it wouldn't get lost or
                    stolen. He met me at the border, San Sebastian, where we stayed for awhile. And
                    then eventually we made our way up to Madrid, where we saw Franco's victory
                    parade at the end of the civil war. Then we went on back to Paris.</p>
                <p>When I was in Paris I went first to an American school called McJannett's School
                    which I think later became the American School. To my father's dismay, I was not
                    learning very much in the way of French. So the following year they put me in a
                    lycee, L'Ecole Alsacienne. I was miserable for 2 weeks trying to learn some
                    French. Neither my teacher nor any other teachers spoke any English at all.
                    There was one girl in the class who spoke some English. So it was kind of rough
                    in the beginning but eventually I got used to it, and got to enjoy it. As a
                    result my French when I first came into the Foreign Service was very good,
                    practically bilingual.</p>
                <p>In 1939, with clouds of war hanging over Europe, my mother and brother and I came
                    back to the States in September 1939. In fact we landed in New York, on August
                    31st and the war started September 1st. The idea had been that my father was to
                    follow on home leave but of course the war changed that. So my brother and I
                    lived with our grandparents in Tarrytown, New York. My grandfather was the
                    President of the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company which is now Westvaco, a
                    family business founded a couple of generations earlier. We lived in Tarrytown
                    from 1939 to 1943.</p>
                <p>My father remained in Paris and eventually followed the French government, in the
                    Spring of 1940, down to Vichy where he was Charg� d'affaires until January 1941.
                    My mother traveled back and forth between Vichy and Tarrytown . Eventually my
                    father was transferred to London where he was the Minister (the number 2), and
                    served also as Political Advisor to General Eisenhower. My mother again made
                    several trips back and forth which was not easy. A lot of it was on PanAm
                    Clippers to Bermuda and the Azores. She had tales of being stuck in Bermuda
                    having to wait for the seas to calm down so they could take off again. My father
                    was in London till the middle of '43.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Meantime I had gone first to a school called The Harvey School near Tarrytown and
                    then to Lawrenceville. I was there from 1941 to '45, eventually graduating in
                    '45. My father and mother came back to Washington in 1943. That brought great
                    joy to my brother and myself to finally have our parents back. They a nice house
                    here on Woodland Drive. He was Director of European Affairs, which later became
                    Assistant Secretary of European Affairs.</p>
                <p>In the Summer of 1945, I graduated from Lawrenceville and went to Princeton. I
                    was at Princeton for my freshman year until February of 1946. At that point the
                    war was over, but it looked as though the draft was going to continue for some
                    time and I was sure I was going to get drafted. So I signed up with the army in
                    April 1946 for 18 months. I went to basic training and then was transferred to
                    Japan, were I served in the occupation of Japan until 1947 and I came back to
                    the States, after that was discharged.</p>
                <p>When it came time to be discharged, the recruiting officer for the Reserves at
                    Fort Lewis Washington said, “You've got three more weeks on your enlistment. If
                    you sign up for the Reserves, you'll be on a train on your way home tomorrow.”
                    “If you don't sign up for the Reserves, we're going to lecture you everyday on
                    why you should join the Reserves up until your very last day of enlistment.” So
                    naturally in 1947, this looked pretty safe so I signed up for the Reserves. I
                    later came to regret that decision because I got caught up in the Korean
                    War.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I went back to Princeton and in my senior year, I met my future wife. I
                    did not pay enough attention to my studies and flunked out. So I went to work at
                    a bank and we nevertheless got married in June 1950. We were in Bermuda on our
                    honeymoon when the North Koreans came over the 38th parallel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: June 25th.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: My wife said, “Oh, you'll be called up.” I said, “no, never, I'm in the
                    Inactive Reserves.” I'd never done anything in the Reserves, nothing at all. So
                    I was sure I was going to be all right. But of course what happened was, the
                    Inactive Reserves were those that were called and my enlistment was extended a
                    year by President Truman. By September, I was on my way to Korea. I was in Korea
                    from November 1950</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right at the beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Near the beginning. We landed in Inchon just as the Chinese were coming
                    over the border, entering the war. So immediately we were put on a troop train
                    for Pusan. We were going to the Pusan perimeter. I ended up, by pure good
                    fortune, in the 2nd Finance Disbursing Section, simply because I had worked in a
                    bank before I was called up. I guess they needed somebody who knew about
                    finance. I felt very fortunate because before when I had been in the army in
                    Japan, I had been in the 1st Cavalry Division, so I escaped some hairy
                    combat.</p>
                <p>We were attached to the IXth Corps Headquarters and followed the troop movements
                    up and down the peninsula, as they went up and came back down again. But to my
                    astonishment, President Truman did not extend the enlistments beyond that one
                    year, so come August 1950 I was discharged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '51 it would be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: '51, I'm sorry. So that was my interlude in Korea. Meanwhile, I wrote
                    to Princeton from the front lines, saying that if I survived this great
                    adventure out here, I'd like to come back to Princeton and finish. They
                    responded, yes of course, if you do survive we'd be glad to have you back. So I
                    went back to Princeton as a married undergraduate and we lived in the old
                    veterans project on Harrison Street, for the final year there. I did graduate
                    and I got a prize from the Woodrow Wilson School for the student who had
                    improved the most over his previous year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
                    Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had your experience as a “foreign service brat” made you
                        aim for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was more interested in foreign affairs, I guess, then I would be
                    otherwise. I was uncertain when I went to Princeton, as to whether I really
                    wanted to join the foreign service. I was a little concerned that perhaps I'd
                    seen some of the more exciting, glamorous parts of the foreign service, and I
                    thought I should try something else. Well, my experience of working in a bank as
                    an executive trainee in New York, I found interesting, but it did not lead me to
                    believe that this was where I wanted to make a career. I just couldn't get
                    excited about the fortunes of the bank, was not something that really stirred
                    me. So I thought, when I came back, by then of course I was married—let's give
                    the foreign service a whirl and see how that goes.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>When I was sent to Korea, it was pretty traumatic of course, for my wife having
                    first been married. She decided rather than continue to live in New Jersey with
                    her parents, she would come to Washington and live with my parents. She got a
                    job in the State Department, working in a clerical capacity but in an office
                    that had a liaison with the CIA. So she was able to keep track, in a certain
                    sense, of what was going on in Korea. But she had a very good experience working
                    in the Department and really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>In the Spring of 1952, just before I graduated from Princeton, I took a civil
                    service exam called the Junior Management exam. I passed that, though it was a
                    very difficult exam, especially the oral part. It was worse than the foreign
                    service oral exam because they sat you down, 7 of you in a room, and you knew
                    that 4 or 3 of the 7 were going to pass and the others would not. So you were
                    directly competing against the others that were there. And there were various
                    topics that would be put out that you had to discuss as a group and come up with
                    recommendations as to what could be done. I remember one of them had to do with
                    the over commercialization of sports, in those days.</p>
                <p>I passed the exam and I was offered a job first in the National Archives, but
                    also I wrote the State Department to see if I couldn't get a job in the
                    Department instead. And Herman Pollack, who has recently died, was instrumental
                    in trying to get me into the Department. And I was offered a job as a GS-5 in
                    the Department at the salary of $3,410 in the Summer of 1952, after I had
                    graduated from Princeton.</p>
                <p>Just after I graduated, our first son was born, named Luke. He was born at
                    Princeton hospital and he's the one who just had a baby yesterday. Or rather his
                    wife just had a baby yesterday.</p>
                <p>So our little family moved to Washington. I started out as the number 3 or 4 guy
                    on the British Desk in what was then called BNA, the British Commonwealth and
                    Northern European Affairs. My boss was a fine man named William L. Hamilton,
                    officer in charge of U.K. and Ireland Affairs. This Bill Hamilton has since
                    passed on. Bill Blue was the Office Director of BNA and Andy Foster was the
                    Deputy Director. We were in what is now the old part of the State Department
                    building, but at that time it was pretty new and fancy. My father at the time
                    was the Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs, which was in effect the
                    3rd ranking job in the Department.</p>
                <p>Not too long after I started work, the elections were held in the Fall of 1952.
                    The Republicans came in, Eisenhower and Dulles, replacing Truman and Acheson.
                    Dulles brought about what may be the only RIF in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is reduction-in-force.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Reduction-in-force, right. Because I was a veteran, this helped a great
                    deal, but in any case, my job was abolished as part of this RIF. But I went onto
                    a register, which is the way it worked in those days. You were on a register
                    with the number of points according to whether you were a veteran and how long
                    you had worked.</p>
                <p>I was the second person on my register and the fellow who was the third, the guy
                    just below me, was Maury Draper. He had been working in the Secretariat so I
                    bumped him out of a job. And I went to work in the Secretariat with Jimmy Burns
                    who was the Administrative Officer for the Secretariat. He managed some how to
                    save Maury Draper's job so we both worked there. I worked in the old Secretariat
                    back in its very early days. Bob Gordon was my immediate supervisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Secretariat doing in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It managed the paper work for the Secretary. We wrote summaries of the
                    day's cables, performed some of the functions that are done today. They also, as
                    I said, managed the paper work that went through from other parts of the
                    Department to the Department principals.</p>
                <p>One of the things that was started while I was there, and I guess I was the first
                    one to actually do this, was a summary of decisions. We had the idea that there
                    ought to be a record of the important decisions that principal officers of the
                    Department made in the course of their tenure. So every day there would be a
                    “brief.” The format that was developed had an active verb followed by a
                    description of what had been decided.</p>
                <p>My job was to try to keep track of all the memoranda and telegrams and letters,
                    that had been personally signed by the Secretary or the Under Secretary or one
                    of the Deputies, and get this into the daily summary that would be produced and
                    sent forward. A lot of this of course involved working on shifts at odd
                    hours.</p>
                <p>The entire Secretariat, I can't remember exactly how many people we had, but it
                    was certainly no more than 12, 15. God knows how many there are now. It was a
                    very interesting and useful assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes it's so difficult today to find out what was
                        decided, I mean, things sort of disappear. This seems like you were in a
                        position to, as a very junior person, to sort of say: they did this. And
                        maybe for the record they'll say, well I never decided that or something
                        like this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It took a certain amount of detective work trying to determine exactly
                    what had been done. But a good many of the papers that would go up, would have a
                    decision on it, whether he approved this or didn't approve it. The same thing on
                    telegrams. If one of the principal officers signed off on a telegram that gave
                    instructions on what to do about Berlin or whatever, then you'd have the
                    decisions. A number of them were not momentous. It was more the day-to-day
                    smaller decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Accumulative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A cumulative record. So that began in 1953, and it has continued to
                    this day. I think that still is the practice of the Secretariat; part of the
                    daily summary is a record of the decisions of the principal officers. So that's
                    what I did, and I found it really very interesting as a junior officer.</p>
                <p>In February 1954 they made up a delegation to go to the Berlin conference, the
                    4-Power Berlin conference in 1954. I was the junior guy that went along on
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dulles of course was the Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Dulles was the principal leader of this conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at the conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I was in the Secretariat. We put together a selection of various
                    documents and things that we thought we might need. I guess today they don't go
                    through quite as much, though I'm sure they produce a lot of briefing books. In
                    terms of a lot of the backup stuff it's so easy to go back to the Department
                    either by telephone or immediate telegram to get answers to things that you
                    might need. But we weren't so sure of that and so we put together several foot
                    lockers, sort of a basic library that we could carry with us.</p>
                <p>This was a conference that went on for 4 or 5 weeks, in February 1954. It was
                    just fascinating to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were obviously way off but did you get any
                        feel from emanations about how Dulles worked at these conferences?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Oh yes, it was a small delegation compared to what we have now. It had
                    Dulles, Doug MacArthur, who was the Counselor of the Department, Livy Merchant
                    was the Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, and Carl Mc.Cardle was the
                    Public Affairs guy. Then we had some military advisors.</p>
                <p>We even had a CIA fellow there who could lip read in Russian. Seats in the
                    conference room were limited by the size of the room, but this fellow always had
                    to be in the front row so he could lip read what the Soviets were saying. But he
                    never came up with anything more significant than: “I have to go to the
                    bathroom,” or “Pass me the water.”</p>
                <p>My job was to process and distribute the telegrams that came in over night to the
                    various principals for action and information. These were materials having to do
                    with the conference and with other affairs that were going on all around the
                    world. It was wonderfully interesting but exhausting. I remember falling asleep
                    in the bathtub one morning when I was trying to wake myself up at around three
                    in the morning.</p>
                <p>It was very exciting also being in Berlin. Some parts of the conference were in
                    East Berlin and parts were in West Berlin. It was fascinating.</p>
                <p>The only specific substantive matter that I remember I had to deal with was the
                    question of Austria. Austria at the time was divided into the 4 different
                    sectors, with one of them occupied by the Soviets. So the conference began
                    working on an Austrian peace treaty.</p>
                <p>I was asked one afternoon on very short notice by Mr. Merchant to prepare a paper
                    for Dulles the next morning on the origins of Swiss neutrality. I had a vague
                    memory that this came out of a European conference at one point but I couldn't
                    remember all the details. So I raced to the library which had a lot of German
                    books and I didn't speak any German. I eventually found something that had a
                    resume of one of the European conferences, I guess it was after the Napoleonic
                    Wars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It might have been the Congress of Vienna.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's probably what it was. I think you're right. The critical point
                    was that Swiss neutrality was something that the Swiss themselves opted for. It
                    was not something imposed on the Swiss by the European powers. And this was the
                    critical point for the Austrian peace treaty. If Austria was to be neutral, this
                    was something that should be chosen by the Austrians themselves and not
                    something imposed from outside. This eventually became part of the basis of the
                    Austrian peace treaty which was negotiated somewhat later. Anyway, I produced
                    this paper overnight and proudly brought it in to Mr. Merchant, who thought it
                    was just what was needed. Dulles was also there and said, that's good work,
                    that's just what we need. So that was my great contribution.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Dulles' way to approach things
                        and all, sort of from the Secretariat point of view, how did he
                        operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was a very different person from Secretary Acheson. We always felt
                    we knew where Acheson was coming from and what his objectives were and where you
                    stood with him. Dulles I think was much more difficult to read. He had, I think,
                    some very strong fundamental views about the Russians and about American foreign
                    policy and what we ought to be doing. He was a more difficult person, I think,
                    to try to pin down as to what his objectives were in any given scenario.
                    Sometimes he would appear to be leaning in one direction when in fact what he
                    was trying to accomplish something quite different. I found him a confusing kind
                    of person to observe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any impression about, I mean, what were the
                        sort of feelings about the Soviets? There was actually some movement in this
                        particular conference unlike many other ones. Was there a feeling that
                        things may start to break?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think there was some hope that there might be of achieving a modus
                    vivendi in Southeast Asia, which had begun at the Berlin Conference in Geneva in
                    the summer of 1954. There was hope that they might be able to accomplish
                    something on Austria. But in more fundamental things, what could be done about
                    Germany, about Eastern Europe and relations with the Soviets, seemed there was
                    very little that could be accomplished. I don't think there was much hope that
                    they could. Dulles was really a very firm cold warrior. He didn't think there
                    was going to be any great warming in that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go to the Geneva conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No. Berlin was the one conference that I attended from the
                    Secretariat.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I had taken the foreign service exams and had passed them, but
                    there were no appointments being made because of the RIF that took place under
                    Dulles. There'd been no appointments for a couple of years in the foreign
                    service. So I continued working in the Secretariat.Then all of a sudden, out of
                    the blue in May 1954 came a query from Personnel as to what would I think about
                    going to Palermo as vice-consul in the foreign service. I thought that'd be
                    great, wonderful, when do you want me there? They said, in 10 days. This had
                    come after waiting for something like 18 months or so, checking almost every
                    week where things stood foreign service appointments. Anyway, what had happened
                    was the Refugee Relief Program of 1953 had come along and the Department got
                    some money and authority to appoint new people.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>My wife was expecting our second child in two months. We decided to go via the
                    Hague where my father was the Ambassador. She stopped in the Hague with our
                    oldest son, who was then about 2, to have our second son who was born in Holland
                    in August '54.</p>
                <p>I went straight on to Palermo in June '54 and when I got there I found to my
                    astonishment that there were something like eight or ten other brand new foreign
                    service officers who had come there from various places around the States. A
                    number of them had also left their wives in one place or another to have babies.
                    So there was quite a crew of us who arrived in Palermo to work in the Refugee
                    Relief Program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the answer but I'm asking for the record. The
                        Refugee Relief Program, there were no real refugees in Sicily, what was
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Refugee Relief Program of 1953 was, I think in essence, was based
                    on a false assumption that there were a lot of refugees left after World War II.
                    This is after all 7 or 8 years after World War II ended, so the refugees who
                    were still unsettled were pretty hard core. There were not that many of them who
                    were still around. But the Act also provided for a certain number of immigrant
                    visas to be issued. And if you couldn't get enough refugees, then they could be
                    used for relatives of American citizens, especially brothers, sisters and
                    parents. And that was what we ended up issuing the visas to in Sicily—large
                    numbers of brothers and sisters of American citizens.</p>
                <p>The Consulate, which was headed by Consul General James Keeley, had gone from a
                    very sleepy place with a total of 6 or 7 Americans to something like 75 as a
                    result of the R.R.P. There was a large contingent of investigators that came to
                    look into the backgrounds of the people that we were issuing visas to. And there
                    was a medical unit that was there, including a doctor who ended up serving a
                    term in Fort Leavenworth for embezzling funds and taking bribes. There were also
                    some immigration people. It was a very sizeable establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was a Refugee Relief officer in Frankfurt, Germany where
                        we were getting real refugees up there. My understanding was that this
                        program, the initial thing was designed to get Italians into the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Italians and Greeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of worked around to make it more palatable. It
                        was turned into a refugee program when it really wasn't. The political
                        impulse was basically to get the Italians in. We also had refugees coming in
                        from the Netherlands.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The only refugees that we had were people who'd been refugees as a
                    result of natural disasters, floods and other kinds of problems in the area.
                    There were primarily Greeks and Italians as well as some Germans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Mafia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That was very interesting. Our personal contacts with the Mafia in
                    Sicily were in essence very amicable. They seemed more a local vigilante
                    group.</p>
                <p>The place that we rented in a village called Mondello, sort of a beach resort for
                    Palermo, was a very pretty little house, and the garden was postage stamp size.
                    But when we rented it, the owner said, there's one condition, you have to hire
                    these two gardeners, Salvatore and Giovanni. I remonstrated and said, there
                    doesn't look like there'll be enough work here for half a gardener let alone
                    two. He said, that's all right, you're going to be very happy with them and
                    that's the condition under which you take the house.</p>
                <p>It turned out of course that they were very low level local members of the Mafia,
                    but very nice men. The result was, that we were only robbed once, when somebody
                    stole some Dr. Dentons ( baby pajamas with feet in them), off the clothesline.
                    These guys were horrified that somebody had the nerve to steal them, so they
                    posted a man with a shotgun in our garage for the next several weeks. That was
                    about the extent of our own direct involvement with the Mafia.</p>
                <p>But there was no doubt they were very influential in Sicily. In terms of what we
                    did, in issuing and denying visas, it was very hard to detect Mafiosi. Anybody
                    who was convicted of course we were able to exclude. But there were a lot of
                    people who were simply under suspicion and it was hard to tell if they were
                    truly Mafia or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the investigators, I mean here you had, I know it was
                        a huge operation all over, and you had these people running around doing
                        investigations in essentially a crime ridden area. Did they turn up anything
                        or were they sort of learning to avoid asking or getting into the wrong
                        places or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We were always a bit puzzled as to what these investigators did. Many
                    of them were of questionable background and qualifications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mostly Italian-American weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A lot of Italian-Americans. As brand new FSOs, I'm afraid we tended to
                    look down on these less qualified people who were not foreign service officers.
                    I can't recall that they produced anything of great moment or great use. But
                    there certainly were a lot of them and they were running all over Sicily, all
                    over Italy for that matter Naples and Genoa also had substantial programs.</p>
                <p>The head of the investigators in Palermo was a very ostentatious fellow, I think
                    his name was Wilfred V. Duke, I don't know what became of him. He cruised around
                    in a bright red convertible. Sicily in those days had nothing but small Fiats.
                    And here he had this bright red convertible. He was supposed to be sort of,
                    undercover, not CIA, but he was supposed to be discreet.</p>
                <p>They had quite a collection of characters that were there. The head of the visa
                    section, a fellow named George Palmer, whose father had been Minister in
                    Afghanistan at some point, was kind of a character himself. He and the head of
                    the investigators, Mr. Duke, became fervent enemies, with big disagreements on
                    everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Q: If it was the way it was when I was dealing with it,
                        about a year later up in Frankfurt, they would make a report which you would
                        get and the immigration service would get. Both of you would then interview
                        the people and if the immigration officer and you made the decision to give
                        them the visa, they were given the visa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It wasn't that formalized in Palermo. I think the way it worked was if
                    the investigators turned something up they would provide a report on what it
                    was. But that was fairly rare. My impression was they didn't get involved in the
                    visa issuing process unless they had something on the individual. But I guess
                    what we did was to run names past them and they'd check with the police or
                    whoever they could find. The applicants were interviewed by the visa issuing
                    officer and I suppose by the immigration person too. I have the feeling they
                    would mostly handle it on paper, and would sign off. If the vice consul approved
                    the visa, then I think the immigration people tended to go along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had joint—one would interview then the
                        other—technically we would interview them first and immigration interviews
                        them afterwards. Well then, you did that for about a year and a half or
                        so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I got there in June 1954. In August my second son was born in Holland,
                    and my wife brought John and Luke, the older boy, to Palermo. I, in the
                    meantime, looked for a house in Mandello and at the urging of some of the old
                    timers who had already been there, I found a house that had central heating.
                    They said this was really needed in the winter because it got quite cold. It was
                    the only place I could find that had heating.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Well, it turned out to be a disaster, a terrible house. My poor wife arrived with
                    this little bitty baby, she probably shouldn't have traveled that early with
                    him, and with the older boy who was two. She didn't speak Italian, none of us
                    spoke Italian when we got there. And here we were in this awful house and she
                    was very unhappy. All we ate was spaghetti for weeks, it seemed like. She
                    finally said that she had enough and she wanted to go home. I said no, I can't
                    do that, we have to stick it out here for a little bit longer. We're going to
                    find another house.</p>
                <p>So I went to the landlady who spoke French. I had a long talk with her and she
                    was very disappointed. But I said that it just was not working out, the house
                    was decrepit, the plumbing didn't work, a variety of things. In addition, I'd
                    inspected it in the daytime and the first night we were there all of a sudden we
                    heard all these police sirens, gun fire, a tremendous racket.I stepped out on
                    the balcony and saw were across the street from an open-air movie theater
                    showing a spaghetti western movie.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we did manage to break the lease and found another more appropriate house
                    complete with Salvatore and Giovanni. Then things improved and we were a whole
                    lot happier. We had visits from both our parents, and traveled all over that
                    fascinating island. We left Palermo in December 1955.</p>
                <p>I credit Bill Boswell with having been the person who really made sure of this
                    because he was the Administrative Counselor in Rome at the time. He'd been down
                    to Palermo and we all told him: Look, we are foreign service officers; we joined
                    the foreign service and we're happy to be here issuing visas but we don't want
                    to do that indefinitely. So he promised he'd get us out in a year and a half and
                    by golly he did.</p>
                <p>We were transferred directly to Zurich which was a nice change. We arrived there
                    in December of 1955. It was an enormous contrast to Palermo, of course. It was
                    just fantastic. You could buy everything in the stores. My wife says that that
                    Christmas, we bought more than we ever had before. We found a lovely house, down
                    the lake in a little town called Thalivil, probably one of the nicest houses we
                    have lived in. We were just lucky because the landlord was interested primarily
                    in somebody who would take good care of his house. He had had experience with
                    Americans before and he liked them.</p>
                <p>My job in the Consulate General was passport and citizenship, welfare and
                    protection officer. The consular district included the Ticino, the Italian
                    Canton of Switzerland. In the meantime we'd learned pretty good Italian in
                    Sicily and it actually got better in Zurich because I had to deal with anything
                    that came up having to do with the Ticino.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Zurich was a wonderful change. The Consul General was an old friend of my father
                    named Carlos Warner, who had been with my father in Cuba many years before. The
                    Deputy was a wonderful guy named Wally LaRue who had lost one lung to TB while
                    serving in India. I think Zurich might have been his last post. He had real
                    trouble breathing. These were two very good mentors. It was a very enjoyable
                    post. We had about 6 or 7 Americans and some very fine local employees.</p>
                <p>So it was a very interesting assignment. Skiing was something we had never done
                    before but we quickly adapted to it. We could ski 15 minutes from the house, it
                    was wonderful. Of course fine restaurants. You could travel up to Germany and
                    down to Italy and over to France, so it was a fascinating period. We had another
                    son born there, a third son, Timmy, who is now a Lieutenant Commander in the
                    navy and who just had a baby also, early this Spring. We were all very happy
                    there. Some of the friends we made in Zurich are still good friends whom we run
                    into from time to time.</p>
                <p>My father in the meantime had been Ambassador to Holland. My mother died in 1955
                    from brain cancer. My father ran into an old friend who had been a secretary of
                    his many years before, whom he liked but didn't have any romantic interest in at
                    the time, named Helen Skouland, a foreign service secretary. After my mother
                    died, he ran into her when she came up to visit Holland and they fell in love.
                    some months later I made arrangements for them to be married in Zurich with a
                    small reception at our house. Then they were transferred to Vienna, so he was
                    Ambassador to Vienna while we were still in Zurich. We were able to travel over
                    to Vienna to visit them several times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get into any, were there any reflections or waves
                        at all from the Hungarian revolt in '56, this is October '56.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There were numerous Hungarian refugees that came into Switzerland. The
                    Swiss were very supportive of the Hungarian refugees. I think they had the
                    feeling the United States should have done more to try to help them. There were
                    accusations that Eisenhower had encouraged the revolt and then had done nothing
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Swiss really leaned over backwards in trying to do everything they
                    could to help the Hungarian refugees that came in large numbers into
                    Switzerland. They found them jobs and did all sorts of things for them. They
                    genuinely went out of their way to help them. I was not dealing with visas then
                    but I think we probably did issue visas to some of them who went on to the
                    States.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>In my job, on the citizenship side, this was a period when various court
                    decisions were dramatically affecting the provisions of the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Act that had to do with loss of citizenship. One after another
                    the different provisions were being set aside as unconstitutional. The
                    requirements on how long you had to live in the States or you lost citizenship;
                    and who became a citizen automatically and who didn't; how you could lose your
                    citizenship; all were being overturned.</p>
                <p>I remember some of the cases had to do with dual citizenship. There was a
                    provision in the 1952 Act that a person who lived abroad for 3 years after
                    acquiring dual citizenship and who took advantage of the second citizenship,
                    could then lose his American citizenship. Lo and behold if it didn't turn out to
                    apply to the President of the American Women's Club in Switzerland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I looked the case over and sent in a request for an advisory opinion on
                    it. The Department came back and said, you've got to expatriate the lady. I made
                    the argument that I didn't think it was constitutional, and I didn't see how you
                    could do this. So I had to call the poor woman and expatriate her. She of course
                    was livid. What she'd done was to get a Swiss passport and used it, and she
                    hadn't been to the States for the required number of years. Anyway, I had to
                    expatriate her. About 4 months later, an instruction came from the Department
                    saying that the Supreme Court had held that that provision was not
                    constitutional, and therefore I should give her back her citizenship. Which I
                    did with some glee.</p>
                <p>On protection side of the job, Zurich seemed to attract more than its share of
                    nuts. The Jung Institute was in Zurich and we often wondered whether the people
                    who came in claiming they were studying at the Jung Institute, maybe were being
                    studied themselves. We had a number of weird cases.</p>
                <p>I remember one spectacular case of a black GI who married a white German girl
                    without the permission of his superior officer in Germany. They came to
                    Switzerland seeking asylum. There was a tremendous amount of argument over their
                    case. The Swiss were very sympathetic, I was too in fact. They also had two
                    children. They were penniless, and despite how sympathetic the Swiss were, they
                    wouldn't give them work permits. Our military authorities claimed he was a
                    deserter and wanted him back I think this was another case where we finally gave
                    them train fare to get to Paris or Cherbourg or Genoa to get a ship home.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we had a large number of welfare cases that were interesting. You dealt
                    with that kind of problem in Europe.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved at all with one of the major
                        activities in Switzerland at the time— spying? Were you aware that it was
                        sort of a meeting place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There was a lot of talk of that. But there didn't seem to be a great
                    deal going on. Major interest of course was banking. The gnomes of Switzerland.
                    That was a very hard subject to learn about and that was not part of my job. The
                    Consul General and the Deputy Consul General tried to pay attention to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The concern of course being that people had secret
                        accounts. At that time you couldn't penetrate that thing. Everybody who was
                        of criminal intent or tax fraud intent plus other reasons, had their Swiss
                        bank accounts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: You couldn't touch them. We had good friends in the banking community
                    there. We made a lot of good friends in Switzerland. Some of them were sort of
                    half-Americans, their wives were Americans. In terms of trying to find anything
                    out about a specific individual, you never got anyplace. But it was interesting
                    in trying to follow to the extent that you could what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for how the Swiss felt about the Cold
                        War which was at it height. Did they really feel neutral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: They were proud of their neutrality. They wanted to make sure it was
                    maintained. They were also very strongly anti-communist. I don't know what the
                    percentages would have been but they had a small communist party, not anything
                    significant. In Zurich especially it seemed to me that there was a very
                    conservative group of people. They felt that we were correct in standing up to
                    the communists. The Swiss always have a kind of superior attitude towards other
                    people. No matter what wonderful thing you may have done lately, the Swiss could
                    have probably done it better, faster, whatever. So there was a bit of that. And
                    as I mentioned earlier, there was criticism of our response to the Hungarian
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>But I think in general the Swiss believed we were right in the lines we were
                    taking. They certainly had no sympathy for what the Soviets had done in Eastern
                    Europe. I think that the Swiss basically tried to be helpful to us. It was
                    almost a positive neutrality they had as opposed to, say the Swedes, a different
                    view.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Our Chiefs of Mission when I was in Zurich were, first, Francis Willis who was
                    our first career foreign service woman Ambassador. She was succeeded by Henry J.
                    Taylor who was a real character. A right-wing radio announcer for General Motors
                    who was a political appointee. General Motors gave him a red Corvette before he
                    came to Switzerland. And he toured around Switzerland in his Corvette with an
                    American flag flying. He had a sad marriage, his wife was quite ill. He acquired
                    a Swiss girlfriend, which unfortunately became rather well known around
                    Switzerland. A lot of fun was made of him from time to time. He was not a
                    wonderful Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it he didn't have much impact on where you
                        were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just sort of an object of derision almost?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A bit. As far as Francis Willis was concerned, any piece of paper that
                    came to us from the Embassy in Bern, even if it was a letter having to do with
                    visas, (because Bern didn't issue any visas, and we did). Francis Willis would
                    have seen it. She kept very close track of everything. Henry Taylor didn't care
                    too much about visas. He used to attend the NATO Ambassadors meetings. American
                    ambassadors from NATO countries would have meetings in various places. He met my
                    father at one of these things. At the end of one of the meetings, he proceeded
                    to stand up and invite everybody to hold the next meeting in Switzerland, which
                    of course would have horrified the Swiss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A NATO meeting in Switzerland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: A NATO meeting in Switzerland. Anyway, he was a character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there and went to Personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: 1958. We had had home leave from Zurich, because we had been direct
                    transferred from Palermo. We had home leave and came back on the Constitution or
                    the Independence, I forget which. Then returning I think on the America or the
                    United States, anyway one of those ships. Those were the days when we had those
                    wonderful sea voyages back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh God, yeah. What were you doing in Personnel? You were
                        there from '59 to '61, what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I came back to the Department to take the mid-career course. I had been
                    in the foreign service for a total of 5 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't had any real basic training at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I never had a foreign service class. I had the Junior Management
                    Program when I first came into the civil service. But I had no basic officers
                    course. I took the mid-career course.</p>
                <p>I was in Personnel, POD, Personnel Operations Division. Loy Henderson was Under
                    Secretary of Management and under him was Wally Stuart and under him was the
                    Director of POD who was John Jova. John had a Deputy named Don Downs. The
                    geographic area chiefs were members of a panel in charge of assignments. We were
                    also in charge of career development. I was at first for a brief time, the
                    number 2 in the European placement office with Galen Stone. Don Macdonald had
                    been the head of the Far East Division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Korean expert.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Korean expert. When he left I was named the head of the Far East
                    personnel placement and that's what I did for two years. We had panel meetings
                    twice a week, figuring out what vacancies were coming up and what officers were
                    due for transfer, trying to work out assignments that both met the needs of the
                    post and the career requirements of the officers concerned. I think it worked
                    quite well.</p>
                <p>The panel that handled the assignments was considered highly sensitive, as nobody
                    outside personnel was supposed to know the details. I think there was not much
                    favoritism; I don't think it was a purely old-boy network arrangement. But it
                    was a contrast to the earlier period when my father was in the foreign
                    service—where everybody knew what was going on, and everybody knew everybody
                    else. When you were assigned to a post then the Ambassador would say—oh yeah,
                    he'll fit in very well. They all knew each other.</p>
                <p>The foreign service had gotten a lot bigger quickly by the time I went into it.
                    The old system no longer worked. And I think our system was pretty
                    efficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little feel for the times, you had some
                        posts that were less desirable than others. Was there much problem getting
                        them staffed, I mean, did people sort of go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think there was generally pretty admirable willingness on the part of
                    people to go to places that were unusual. While I was in Personnel, one of my
                    clearest memories is when John Jova and Loy Henderson went on a trip all around
                    Africa to decide where we ought to open posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very famous trip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: They came back with wonderful art materials. They came back with
                    spears, daggers, and all sorts of stuff, statues that they picked up along the
                    way. They gave most amusing accounts of travel in all these places. The
                    department ended up opening posts in all of the places they'd been to, all of
                    the former colonies of Africa. Maybe today we should try to scale it back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there had been a debate whether or not to have
                        centralized places and all. But they realized this wasn't going to
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It wouldn't work.</p>
                <p>So we ended up with all these posts. Sheldon Vance was the placement officer for
                    Africa and the Near East. He had a lot of scurrying around to do to try to fill
                    spots. The most difficulty he had was trying to find qualified administrative
                    people to go out and set up these new places. I guess it's the same kind of
                    problem we're having now with the former Soviet Union. There were some strange
                    places we had to set up.</p>
                <p>The area I was dealing with was the Far East. There were a number of hardship
                    posts there including Vietnam in the early days, but I really didn't have any
                    trouble trying to fill the jobs in the Far East.</p>
                <p>Douglas MacArthur II whom I had known earlier at the Berlin conference was a good
                    friend of my father's from Vichy days as ambassador in Tokyo, he was notoriously
                    difficult to please in terms of personnel. He came back on conversation and I
                    had a meeting with him and with the Executive Director for the Far East bureau,
                    Jimmy Johnstone. MacArthur with his piercing eyes, started off by saying, “If
                    you and Jimmy don't get me better people out here, you're going to need an
                    asbestos jock strap cause I'm going to burn your balls.” So much for old
                    friends! I think he actually treated me pretty well in the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course one of the problems was Mrs. MacArthur too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well anyway, he was a character.</p>
                <p>Then I'm afraid we did not always assign our best caliber people to Australia and
                    New Zealand, because (garbled) we didn't have a lot of problems there compared
                    to other countries in the area.</p>
                <p>There was an Ambassador Sebald in Canberra who came back for a briefing. Our
                    second son at 5 or 6 had written in to one of the local kids TV programs . I
                    think it was Ranger Hall, a silly children's show. Anyway, John got an
                    invitation to go on this program and ask questions of Ranger Hall. I wanted to
                    watch this and so I asked one of the girls in the office to bring in a TV.</p>
                <p>Well the interview with Ambassador Sebald turned out to be the same day. He was
                    scheduled for quarter of five but he was late getting there so it was about five
                    of five when he got there. I explained to him what this show was about but I
                    think his mind was elsewhere. At five o'clock, the girls came in and turned on
                    this program with my son and Ranger Hall. And Ambassador Sebald watched it for a
                    bit. We were all cheering at John and laughing. Finally we turned off the TV,
                    and he turned to me and asked, “Do you watch this show every evening?” I
                    said,”no,” but I think he figured,” no wonder I'm getting lousy personnel if the
                    assignments officers sit and watch this kiddie program every afternoon”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is of course one of the problems you were talking
                        about, sending people to Australia. I was doing consular personnel and we
                        tended to, poor London, the consular section in London and in Paris and a
                        few other places, tended to get people that we didn't know what to do with
                        elsewhere. Because we couldn't send one lousy consular officer to a small
                        post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was an interesting assignment, sending officers and families out to
                    the Far East. I'd never served in the Far East except for Japan and Korea when I
                    was in the army.</p>
                <p>Then John Jova, whom I said was the head of POD, had the bright idea that I
                    should go to Western Europe, which made a certain amount of sense because I had
                    bilingual French, which was getting rustier and rustier. In the meantime I had
                    learned Italian and some Spanish and German. So he had it all lined up—Spanish
                    language training, Spanish desk in 1961; and from there I was to go to Madrid
                    for at least 3, maybe 5 years. Then I'd be launched on my European career.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>So this worked out at first. I did Spanish language, and my wife went through it
                    too. Then I went on to the Spanish desk. It was a lot of fun being on the
                    Spanish desk. Frank Meloy was the Director of WE, Galen Stone was the Deputy and
                    George West was also the Deputy later. EJ Beigel, the famous EJ Beigel, was a
                    long-term civil servant. He and I worked very closely. Frank Stares was the
                    Portuguese desk officer. The officer-in-charge, my immediate boss, was a guy
                    named Ray Valliere. One of the things we worked on, most assiduously, was the
                    renewal of the Spanish base agreement. It came up every five years and it was
                    due in 1963.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, the principal players, the Spanish desk
                        in the Pentagon? I assume you probably felt they were equally a problem or
                        not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Essentially what it came down to was that the Spaniards wanted to get
                    as much as they possibly could. The Pentagon had very helpful assets in Spain
                    and was anxious to renew the base agreement despite some of the attitudes over
                    at the White House, where the Kennedy administration had just come in. Some of
                    them thought that Franco was a relic of World War II; the last remaining
                    Fascist; no need for us to truck with him; we don't really need those bases. The
                    Pentagon was upset at these views. I remember there was one meeting where
                    Chester Bowles and Sam Lewis...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was head of IO at the time, wasn't he? Or was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was working for Bowles, who was the Under Secretary. They were both
                    strongly anti Franco. Over at the Pentagon, of course, they didn't think much of
                    this.</p>
                <p>So the effort was to try to get the renewal plus some new uses that we were
                    interested in. The Defense Department especially the Navy was interested in
                    acquiring rights to the ROTA naval base for our nuclear submarines. The question
                    arose of whether we needed all the bases we had. At the same time, the
                    Portuguese negotiations were going on. Frank Stares was the desk officer.
                    Somebody had the bright idea of using a computer for the Portuguese base
                    negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about 19—?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: 1962 it was. '' Q: Which was very early computer.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: They had the idea that maybe the computer could tell us how to renew
                    the Portuguese base agreement. Well it ended up that the Portuguese agreement
                    was resolved without any renewals. It just went on being agreed without a formal
                    renewal. Eventually they did come up with a renewal.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Anyway, poor Frank Star had to cope with these people trying to put everything on
                    a computer. Trying to answer your point, it wasn't a great success. The Spanish
                    base agreement was eventually renewed. I worked hard on this. It was a very
                    satisfying thing to accomplish. The fellow who was the Third Secretary at the
                    Spanish Embassy at the time was a man named Jaime Ojeda who is now the
                    Ambassador here.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I had a good time doing that. There were several problems with
                    Ambassadors to Spain who were appointed but didn't manage to serve. One was
                    Ellis Briggs who ended up having hepatitis for a second time and it finished off
                    his career. He'd been another friend of my father's in the Cuban days. Anthony
                    J. Drexel Biddle was another Ambassador who was supposed to go there but he died
                    suddenly. In the meantime the Spanish Ambassador to Washington also died.
                    Eventually, Bob Woodward was named Ambassador. He was the Ambassador when Nancy
                    and I were transferred to Madrid in the summer of 1963. In the meantime, we'd
                    had a fourth child here in Washington, a daughter; to give us three sons and a
                    daughter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Spain when you went
                        there in 1963?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well, Franco was in charge, very much in charge. We speculated for
                    years about what would happen after Franco died. Everybody thought that was
                    probably going to be imminent. It took 12 more years — There were some efforts
                    at liberalization, trying to make the regime less oppressive. But it didn't turn
                    out to amount too much. It was only later, considerably later, that Franco
                    started paying serious attention to who and what kind of regime might succeed
                    him.</p>
                <p>In the end, the Spaniards did a remarkable job, with considerable luck, in how
                    they handled the succession. The pretender to the throne Don Juan was considered
                    sort of a joke, but he had a son, Juan Carlos, whom Franco had taken under his
                    wing. He tried to assure that he got a proper education, went through three
                    military academies, so he'd end up with as broad a background as possible as the
                    time approached. Franco finally died in '75. I guess in '73 or '74 it became
                    clear that Juan Carlos was going to be the person to succeed Franco and that's
                    what happened. The transition ended up being very smooth.</p>
                <p>But when I was there in Spain, the fear was that there would be another bloody
                    revolution. It looked bad and I think the bitterness of the civil war was still
                    very strong indeed. Franco did nothing to try to appease those who had been on
                    the other side of the civil war. His Valle de los Caidos, outside of Madrid, is
                    a monument only to those on his side who lost their lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American interests were bases and trying to
                        prevent...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: — Our interests in Spain were trying to see that Spain became a full
                    fledged member of Europe; democracy to the extent that it could be promoted;
                    that there be a peaceful transition from Franco to whoever succeeded.</p>
                <p>Our primary interest at the time were the bases, so very important. They became
                    increasingly critical as we lost air fields and other facilities in North
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Libya, in particular Williams Air Base.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Also Morocco. So that Spain became the primary training area especially
                    for the air force. We also had the major new interest in Rota, the Polaris
                    submarine base. We also had some commercial interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Spain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: This was interesting because here I'd been the Spanish desk officer,
                    dealing directly with the Ambassador on most things, correspondence back and
                    forth on a professional level, and I was an FSO-4.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About, in those days, equivalent to a Major.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I had a pretty good promotion record so I was a 4. Then I went to
                    Madrid and all of a sudden, here I was the second most junior person in a 7-man
                    political section and the area that was spelled out for me was the Falange. I
                    was supposed to do reporting on the Falange which was the government political
                    party which by then was pretty decrepit. They were not very appealing, and very
                    hard to get a handle on.</p>
                <p>So I'd gone from what seemed to be an important role player in Spanish-American
                    relations to a junior guy. I suppose this is typical of most European embassies
                    because of the desirability of the posts. They tended to be pretty top heavy in
                    terms of personnel. Bob Woodward was the Ambassador, he was a wonderful
                    Ambassador. Bob McBride was the DCM, the Political Counselor was a guy named
                    Pete Watrous, Bill Fraleigh had been the Counselor for years but he left by the
                    time I got there. Watrous was the Political Counselor, Bob Zimmermann was the
                    Deputy, George Landau was also there, there were some others, a first tour
                    political officer. That was just the political section. There were a whole lot
                    of people there.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Spain was a fascinating place, it was really great to be there. The kids were put
                    into the American School there, very happy with that. My wife loved Spain very
                    much and we found a nice house. The whole personal and family side was fine.</p>
                <p>From a job standpoint, I was pretty low on the totem pole. In that sense I think
                    I was lucky that we'd been there just about a year when I got a telegram saying:
                    off to Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Q: This was no 'we'd like a volunteer' or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, there was no volunteering. Well, it turned out that two old
                    friends, Bob Miller and Mel Manfull were in Saigon and they were trying to
                    collect good offers to come to Vietnam. I was very disappointed this was
                    September 1964. It had been less than a year since Diem was assassinated. The
                    political and military situation seemed to be deteriorating rapidly.</p>
                <p>So despite the fact that the family could have gone, it seemed unwise for them to
                    do so. So while I was in Saigon two years, they stayed in Spain which I think
                    turned out to be a wise decision. They had a good house, good school, and
                    servants. My wife was faced with a very new situation. At the beginning she
                    would write me about some problems with the kids, and even though I'd answer
                    right away, by the time the letter got back, the problem had disappeared. So it
                    forced a new independence on her, it was difficult at the time but she stepped
                    right in and did a wonderful job with the kids.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I was in Saigon for two years; I got home for one Christmas, and in the
                    Summer of '65 I got back for home leave. So I did see the family a couple of
                    times. My wife, because she still had orders to go out to Saigon, came out to
                    see what it looked like, right after Christmas 1964. So Tet 1965, she was there
                    and met everyone.</p>
                <p>McGeorge Bundy had come out for President Johnson for a look-see during this
                    period. While he was there, the NVA attacked a couple of our bases. He went to
                    the hospital and saw some of the wounded soldiers, and was traumatically
                    impressed by what he'd seen. Meantime, Maxwell Taylor, who was the Ambassador,
                    and General Westmoreland had been pleading with LBJ to authorize the bombing of
                    North Vietnam, because there had been increasing evidence of North Vietnamese
                    attacks in South Vietnam. The only way to try to turn this around was to show
                    the North Vietnamese that they couldn't do this and therefore we ought to start
                    bombing North Vietnam. LBJ said no, he was not prepared to do that so long as
                    there were wives and children in Saigon. There might possibly be retaliation
                    against them. If we're going into a war situation, we shouldn't have wives and
                    children there.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>When McGeorge Bundy came and he saw the wounded Americans, he sent a cable
                    endorsing Taylor's and Westmoreland's recommendation for the bombing campaign
                    against North Vietnam. He specifically tied it to retaliation for attacks on the
                    American camps in Vietnam. LBJ approved it but at the same time ordered the
                    evacuation of all wives and children, which made sense. It was disturbing to see
                    a school bus full of American school children driving around the streets of
                    Saigon as easy targets for terrorism, although they were never attacked. Anyway,
                    all the families got evacuated including my wife who'd come out on my transfer
                    orders. She was evacuated to Hong Kong and I went with her for a brief
                    vacation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: When I got to Saigon in September '64, I was assigned to the political
                    section. My role changed while I was there. Maxwell Taylor was the Ambassador
                    and Sam Berger was the Deputy, Mel Manfull was the Political Counselor and Bob
                    Miller was the Chief of the Political Section.</p>
                <p>My job was twofold, one was to be the reports officer in the political section
                    and the other was to be the political-military liaison with MACV. What I did in
                    the beginning was a draft, a weekly telegram for Taylor to send back to Johnson
                    summarizing the political, economic, military and phychological situation.</p>
                <p>There was a great deal of political turmoil in this period but eventually we
                    ended up with Thieu and Ky . There was a continuing struggle between the two. In
                    the summer of 1965 I was given home leave and picked up the family in Spain and
                    spent two months in Colorado and returned to Saigon.</p>
                <p>By the time I got back Taylor had left and Cabot Lodge had come for his second
                    tour in Saigon. Sam Berger had left and was replaced by Bill Porter. Manfull
                    left and was replaced by Phil Habib out of Korea; not too long after that, Bob
                    Miller left and I took his place as Chief of the Political Section. Phil Habib
                    was the Minister Counselor for Political Affairs. My role then became more of
                    Political-Military Liaison to MACV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MACV was the military headquarters in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Military headquarters, General Westmoreland's headquarters.</p>
                <p>When I first got to Saigon, the Westmoreland meetings that I would go to, would
                    be held in a room somewhat bigger than this but not a great deal bigger.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very small room we are talking about, 8x10 or
                        something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It's a small room. There were about six or eight people sitting around
                    the table with Westmoreland. I think he had maybe two other generals and the
                    embassy representative was very high in the hierarchy there. The whole effort
                    was what we could do to try to support the Vietnamese military units. Everybody
                    there had the job of trying to do what we could to push the Vietnamese along,
                    make sure they got proper equipment they needed, ammunition and intelligence and
                    everything else that went with it. That was the whole effort.</p>
                <p>In the spring of '65, we began the bombing of North Vietnam in the program called
                    “Rolling Thunder.” Not too long after that we landed some marines up around
                    Danang and Chulai, and then the 173rd airborne came in, and then the 1st Calvary
                    Division.</p>
                <p>The whole nature of the war changed, so that before long the MAC meetings were
                    held in much bigger quarters. The embassy rep was pushed farther down the end of
                    the table, there were lots and lots of generals around. The people who were in
                    charge of advising the Vietnamese had trouble getting any word in edgewise. All
                    the effort was on bringing the Americans in, getting American troops deployed,
                    building Cam Ranh Bay, the great base that went in there. The whole nature of
                    the war changed completely from trying to help the Vietnamese to our taking it
                    over, trying to do it ourselves. Then of course the pendulum later swung back
                    the other way.</p>
                <p>But this was a fascinating period. I had general supervision of the provincial
                    reporters in the embassy, who were six or eight young Foreign Service officers
                    who spoke Vietnamese. They would fan out around the provinces to try to find out
                    what really was going on, try to learn things, because there was a general, I
                    guess a natural, distrust of the reporting that came in, especially from the
                    military but also from the CIA. So we were trying to get our own independent fix
                    on what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the problems with first the military, and then
                        second the CIA, from your perspective of that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well I think one of the problems with the military, I don't know
                    whether you could pin it all on McNamara, but a major problem they had was in
                    trying to measure something that was not measurable. They came up with all these
                    crazy statistics that became great sources of contention with the press. They
                    had body counts, and they had the numbers of structures destroyed, and acres of
                    land defoliated, and endless numbers of different measurements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Villages were classified in different terms.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Then when the famous Robert Komer became the head of pacification in
                    Washington, he developed the Hamlet Evaluation Survey, the HES. The HES had a
                    whole complicated list of questions you applied, as to whether the hamlet was
                    safe or contested or lost Then they put little dots on the maps as to which area
                    was which.</p>
                <p>We had a whole series of American officials all over the countryside, advisers to
                    the province chief, advisers to the district chief, advisers to the sector chief
                    and so forth. We had a consulate in Danang.</p>
                <p>The problem with the military, I think, was that their reports were called
                    progress reports so you could never show anything that was not progress. There
                    was great pressure on military officers to show that things had improved, with
                    the implication being that if things got worse, it was your fault, which was
                    completely the wrong kind of judgement to make. These results were dependent on
                    what the enemy's efforts were.</p>
                <p>I think throughout the Vietnam war we tended to have a strange, I guess a very
                    American feeling, that if something didn't go the way we wanted it to go, it was
                    our fault. We never took into account that this depended on what efforts the
                    enemy made. We could never get through our heads also that if we did something
                    to the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese, they would come back and hit us just
                    as hard as they had before.</p>
                <p>Furthermore we had the idea that if we just kept racheting up the pressure on
                    them, Westmoreland's famous phrase—”attriting the Vietnamese”, this would
                    gradually bring them to the point where they were just destroyed and couldn't
                    continue. This was especially true of our bombing of North Vietnam, the idea of
                    rolling thunder. It'd roll up there, and the thunder got worse and worse and
                    worse, and eventually they would just have to give up and quit. This was a total
                    misreading, it turned out, of the Vietnamese temperament. They were prepared to
                    go on forever, they'd beaten the French this way and they were going to beat
                    us.</p>
                <p>The result of all this was that I think in the embassy there was considerable
                    distrust of the military figures, as to what was going on, what was happening.
                    This I think was certainly shown in Tet 1968— the great attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the time that you were there, we're talking
                        about '64 to '66, what about the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I don't think we had any particular problem with the CIA. I think we
                    felt that a lot of them were kind of wild men. We weren't sure if they had any
                    particularly better grasp on what was happening than others. But they were a
                    good balance to what was being reported by the military. This was another reason
                    why we in the embassy, the State Department, tried to bring our own assessments,
                    to attain our own views of what, in fact, was happening on the countryside
                    through the civilian advisers to many of the provinces and to many of the
                    districts. We had a pretty good corps of young officers who were spread around
                    who were doing these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for how the embassy reports were
                        treated back in Washington as opposed to the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think I got a better feel for that when I was later transferred in
                    1966 back to Washington to the Vietnam Working Group. I worked there for 4
                    years, and I had a better feel for what the relationship was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your impression of Ambassador Taylor and
                        Ambassador Lodge, how they operated and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: They were totally different people. Ambassador Taylor was a remarkable
                    military figure. He would come back to Washington about every three months to
                    personally brief President Johnson on what was going on. He was a very hard
                    worker. When he came back to Washington, he always brought somebody from the
                    embassy along, sort of his escort, to carry his papers and take care of chores
                    that he might feel were needed in Washington.</p>
                <p>I came with him in the Spring of 1965. While we were back here, the embassy was
                    attacked. The famous attack where a taxi cab blew up right outside the embassy.
                    A lot of people were hurt. One American and several local employees were killed.
                    I think if he hadn't brought me back on this trip, I'd have probably been
                    hanging out the window there, looking to see what the noise was. My window was
                    one of the few that would open in the building. I'm sure I would have been
                    looking to see what this noise was, probably would have had my head blown
                    off.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I did come back with him. I noticed on the airplane that he carried with
                    him the Corriere de la Sera from Milan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italian newspaper.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: the Frankfurter Algemeine, Le Monde and a Spanish language paper, I
                    think it was from Argentina, a Buenos Aires paper. He read these 4 papers on the
                    plane, among other things. When he came to a word he didn't know, he had a
                    little dictionary and he'd look them up. He was that kind of man. A man of
                    extraordinary discipline. He believed in making the best use that you could of
                    your time but also to keeping your skills up, that military training. This was
                    just simply another example, there he was working to enhance his language
                    skill.</p>
                <p>He was very straightforward, he was a straight arrow. A military leader. I think
                    the embassy felt that this was a man that could lead you on to what your
                    objectives were. Whether the policies worked out while he was there, I guess
                    that could be questioned. In fact, he supported the military pretty much in what
                    they wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Cabot Lodge was a totally different kind of character, very emotional, he could
                    go up and down, very excitable. He was a politician. One of the extraordinary
                    things to watch was how this Connecticut Brahmin, a very political figure by
                    nature, a very social figure, how he related to Phil Habib who was this Lebanese
                    American from Brooklyn. Phil could just wrap Cabot Lodge around his little
                    finger, it was just amazing how the two of them got along. Phil could talk back
                    to Cabot Lodge, could persuade him on virtually anything that he wanted to do.
                    It was just a remarkable combination there. And of course Bill Porter was
                    playing the role of the Deputy Ambassador. It was a very good combination.</p>
                <p>Lodge was much more quixotic, you were never entirely sure what was going to set
                    him off on some particular tangent, one time or another. He had a lot of
                    memories, of course, of what had gone before when he was there the first time.
                    Some of the memories were correct and some of them really weren't. He tried to
                    butter up and assuage Thieu and Ky during this period.</p>
                <p>What happened was Ky, who looked as though he was going to be the person who was
                    really going to drive the Vietnamese government, really lead it, he
                    miscalculated and permitted Thieu to become President and Ky was going to be
                    Vice President. Ky thought that he was going to be able to run the whole thing,
                    from behind the scenes, but it turned out that Thieu was a stronger and more
                    clever character than Ky thought he was. Thieu also had other support from the
                    Vietnamese Military.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of jealousy of Ky because he was flamboyant, and I think some of
                    the Americans didn't quite trust him either. They were never too sure of what he
                    was up to. Whereas Thieu they felt was more amenable to American control. Ky in
                    effect got kind of faked out in the whole process. Thieu very much became the
                    prominent figure among the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about General William Westmoreland? He of course was
                        a major figure in the Vietnam thing. In your meetings with him, what was
                        sort of your estimate, that you were getting from others around you, of how
                        he viewed things.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was a straight forward soldier. I don't think that he had a great
                    deal of subtlety in terms of understanding some of the other dimensions of the
                    Vietnamese problems, the political or the social side of it. He paid some lip
                    service to it, but I don't think he really appreciated how important it was to
                    'try to win the hearts and minds.' The military would often use that phrase, but
                    I think it was more almost in derision, rather than a real belief that that was
                    needed to be done.</p>
                <p>In fact, that was one of the basic problems, that the government of Vietnam
                    became less and less popular. Partly because it couldn't protect the people but
                    also because of a lot of corruption, a lot of inability to get things done. I
                    think the vast majority of people simply wanted to be left alone, to continue
                    their traditional way of life. Growing rice in the countryside, a very rich
                    country. The Vietnamese people were caught between the NVA and the Viet Cong on
                    one side and the Vietnamese authorities on the other.</p>
                <p>I think that Westmoreland, as well as most of the military, had tremendous faith
                    in the ability of the American soldier, American troops, American equipment to
                    accomplish things that the Vietnamese, despite all the training they got from
                    us, didn't have the same courage or the same willingness to carry through and
                    fight on. One major difference between the Vietnamese and the American soldier,
                    was that the American soldier was there on a specific limited tour, sometimes 6
                    months, sometimes a year.</p>
                <p>The Americans knew they were going to be there for that period of time and then
                    they're out. That's it buddy, somebody else is going to come in and finish this
                    job. The Vietnamese, they were there for good. So they were maybe a little less
                    interested in taking chances and making commitments that were irrevocable in
                    terms of the people on the other side. Of course there were a lot of families
                    that were on both sides of the issue among the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>It was a very complicated mission. Despite all the tremendous effort that we put
                    into it, the numbers of troops, well over half a million, the numbers of bases
                    that we established, and the bombing that we conducted against North Vietnam,
                    these things in the end just weren't enough. I don't think you can entirely
                    blame the South Vietnamese for this; we continually underestimated the
                    resiliency and the strength of the North Vietnamese and their willingness to
                    take incredible punishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1966. What was your impression, how did
                        you think things were going when you left that time—whither Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think in '66 we thought that probably we were making progress, the
                    government seemed relatively stable by that time, American troops were coming in
                    in very large numbers, I think we felt that we were beginning to make some
                    progress in the countryside and against the Viet Cong in all the different
                    areas.</p>
                <p>On the military side, the political side and the economic side, I think all these
                    things were looking good in '66 when I came back. I think they continued to look
                    good— even Tet '68 when there was this great surprise with the attack of the
                    Viet Cong. You have probably heard the opinion, and I think it's true, that the
                    Viet Cong suffered heavy losses in that '68 attack, when all of their
                    infrastructure rose up and came out and was mowed down.</p>
                <p>In fact it was a strictly military victory for the South in 1968. But
                    politically, it was a defeat because of what we had said publicly about what was
                    happening and some of the pictures that the media was able to show, even the
                    American embassy being attacked. Westmoreland had come back at Christmas '67,
                    and made a speech to a Joint Session of Congress about light at the end of the
                    tunnel, implying that the war was about over—all these optimistic statements
                    blew up in his face.</p>
                <p>Even though on the ground. Tet '68 was a definite plus for the South Vietnamese
                    side, it ended up as a great debacle. It was the turning point in the war
                    because the American public, especially the left-wing here, the students and
                    professors, the media, they just completely blew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you left Saigon in '66, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well I first flew from Saigon to Madrid where my family had been
                    staying during the two years I'd been in Saigon. I picked them up and we came
                    back to the U.S. by ship, either the Constitution or the Independence, a last
                    trip on a boat.</p>
                <p>I then went to work in the Vietnam Working Group. I was there for another four
                    years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '66 to '70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: 1966 to 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Vietnam working group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Basically it was the Vietnam desk at the State Department. It was a
                    very large desk, I think we had as many as 10 officers on the desk at the time.
                    The idea was that we were supposed to be, in a sense, coordinating a lot of US
                    government policy and activity in Vietnam. Of course that was something that
                    could not be done, given the range of activities that were going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, who was running it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Robert Miller was the Director. He stayed there, another two years,
                    then he went on to London to the Imperial Defense College. He was replaced by,
                    John Burke. Then when Burke left, Chuck Flowerree replaced him. When Flowerree
                    left, I replaced him. I think that was only for about 6 months at the end. Our
                    bosses were Len Unger and then Bill Sullivan. We also were involved not only
                    with what was going on in Vietnam, but along during that period the Paris peace
                    talks began, so we were also attempting to backstop the operations there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you talk about Vietnam, were Laos and Cambodia really
                        included? Was it really Indochina? How did they fit into it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We were pretty exclusively concentrated on Vietnam. There were separate
                    desks that dealt with Laos and Cambodia. But of course there was an obvious
                    relationship between the three. When Phil Habib came back from Vietnam, he
                    became very much involved in the Vietnam Working Group.</p>
                <p>Our bosses were clearly involved in the bigger picture of Laos and Cambodia but
                    we were attempting to deal specifically with Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strictly Vietnam you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We were primarily trying to keep an eye on State Department reporting
                    from Vietnam; relationships with the White House; to some extent involvement
                    with the Pentagon, with AID, CIA, there were frequent interagency meetings that
                    would deal with one subject or another. Our emphasis was primarily on the
                    Vietnam side of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there, what was sort of the mood or the
                        feeling of the Vietnam Working Group? Whither Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: As to how we were doing? Were we winning the war? I think we were
                    basically pretty optimistic. The optimism remained at least until after Tet
                    '68—the famous Viet Cong and North Vietnamese attack on the cities in South
                    Vietnam. This of course was a very traumatic experience for everybody concerned.
                    I concur with those who believe that the Tet Offensive was really a defeat,
                    militarily anyway, for the VC and the North Vietnamese, in that they surfaced
                    all of their infrastructure and they were very badly bloodied by the counter
                    attacks by the South Vietnamese and by our own forces.</p>
                <p>The problem of course was that, I believe it was around Christmas of 1967,
                    General Westmoreland came back and addressed a joint session of Congress, in
                    which he talked about “the light at the end of the tunnel,” and how he thought
                    before long we'd be able to reduce forces and everything was going along
                    beautifully. And only less than two months later there was this enormous
                    uprising. There were video pictures, TV, of Viet Cong attacking the American
                    Embassy compound in Saigon. A great to-do that they had overrun the Embassy and
                    most of the city.</p>
                <p>So the public perception was that once again the administration had been
                    misleading the American public on what was truly going on. From then on, if we
                    hadn't already lost public opinion on Vietnam, I think that was when we clearly
                    did lose it. So that was a very serious blow, it seemed to me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, most of the ones on the desk had been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you treat the reports that were coming in? I mean
                        it was the time when we certainly were looking for the good. I mean having
                        been in the field, say—we know the pressures here. How were you treating
                        these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that we certainly gave more credence to reports from the
                    Embassy in the political section than we did to the military reports on what was
                    going on. Already I think there was a lot of lack of confidence, a substantial
                    lack of confidence, in much of the military reporting as well as in the famous
                    HES survey. I forget when the HES came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the Hamlet evaluation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Hamlet Evaluation Survey that the famous Bob Komer started up. They
                    were, after all, basically called 'progress reports' and so the implication to
                    start with was that this was progress. So I think there was a lot of feeling
                    that much of this was just hype, was not really true, that they tried to always
                    look at the brighter side of things.</p>
                <p>But nevertheless there seemed to be a general improvement in the situation. That
                    our forces were making a significant difference in what was happening there.
                    There were of course, continuing reports of the increasing and continuing North
                    Vietnamese movements into the South. There was a lot of frustration over our
                    inability to stop the movement down the Ho Chi Minh trail, despite all sorts of
                    efforts to try to stop it including, I think, dropping some kind of detectors
                    along the trail to detect movement, B-52 bombings, all of this kind of thing.
                    But nevertheless, the North continued to move things South. So I think there was
                    obvious frustration on the part of the military that this wasn't helping very
                    much.</p>
                <p>There was also concern that perhaps the bombing of North Vietnam was not
                    accomplishing what it was intended to do. Once again, I think I mentioned in a
                    previous session, our whole idea was that a 'rolling thunder' which our bombing
                    raids were called, would just continue to increase the pressure on North
                    Vietnam, and that eventually the North Vietnamese would see that this
                    relentlessly increasing pressure was going to be so severe that they were going
                    to have to give up. Well, this didn't work. It was a miscalculation on our part
                    or a misunderstanding of North Vietnamese determination. They simply just kept
                    going regardless of what the price was.</p>
                <p>I think a lot of us also began to have the feeling that air power was not
                    something that ever was going to win the war. I have ever since had a great deal
                    of skepticism about the possibilities of “surgical strikes” even when they're
                    with the wonderful new equipment that was shown in the Persian Gulf War. I think
                    some of that is still a lot of nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Dean Rusk in his memoirs mentioned that all his
                        professional career, he dealt with the promise of air power and the
                        actualities of air power and had to reconcile the difference between
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's exactly right. Consider the number of times that we tried to hit
                    that famous bridge in North Vietnam and we never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Johnson years first. How did you feel
                        about the White House? Were you feeling that you had to give an optimistic
                        view or did you feel, at your level, did you feel any pressure from the
                        White House, the National Security Council, on how you dealt with
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, not in the sense of having to show that everything was upbeat. I
                    certainly had such feeling. On the military side, they probably did feel some.
                    On the military side, especially for those who were dealing with the provinces
                    as distinct from the American military units, I think a lot of the province
                    advisors were under considerable pressure to show progress, the implication
                    being that if the war wasn't going right in their province, it was their fault.
                    Which of course was a lot of nonsense. It depended on how much effort was being
                    put on the other side.</p>
                <p>But as far as the Vietnam Working Group was concerned, I didn't feel any sense of
                    pressure to report or to try to give a rosy view of what was going on. In fact I
                    think Bill Sullivan and Phil Habib, were often much more on the pessimistic side
                    than perhaps their military colleagues were in dealing with the White House. So
                    I didn't feel any sense of pressure from that side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the CIA? What was your impression of how they
                        were reporting and dealing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think the CIA also tended to be somewhat skeptical of the military.
                    That is always a CIA viewpoint, a mistrust of the ability of the military to get
                    things done and to properly appreciate what's going on. The CIA also had a much
                    greater, I don't want to use the word 'stake,' but they were much more involved
                    in direct activities on the ground. So in that sense, they also had some
                    pressure to believe and to show that they were making progress.</p>
                <p>The State Department was in a unique position in that we weren't really, as the
                    State Department, operating any programs in Vietnam. We did have people who were
                    involved in a lot of the different programs. Many of the provincial advisors or
                    district advisors were State Department officers. But the State Department per
                    se did not have any programs that it was directing, so we didn't have that
                    particular ax to grind on our own side. Maybe this also made us more skeptical
                    of the activities of other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You almost run into these, but at the same time, I mean
                        did you get any sort of the frustration that President Johnson was feeling
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well certainly some of it. I think a lot of us felt this frustration,
                    especially those of us who had been involved in Vietnam before the massive
                    American presence began, before the Spring of '65. I got in '64 and most of the
                    other guys had been there longer that that.</p>
                <p>Once American troops had come in and we'd begun to throw the full weight of our
                    effort into the war, nevertheless, the VC and the North Vietnamese were still
                    able to survive. I think they'd been severely beaten back, and especially by Tet
                    '68, they had gone significantly down hill. But nevertheless, they were still
                    there and we hadn't won the war. They showed every evidence of continuing.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I think we all had that sense of frustration that things were not going better
                    than we thought they probably would once our own forces had gotten involved. We
                    were like everybody else in the country. That here we are, an enormous world
                    power and we're not able to take on this small bunch of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, you know, there's intensive, particularly in
                        the military, the Kennedy administration got involved in this, a tendency to
                        look for an American quick solution—either special forces or getting the
                        right kind of rice in or handing out M-16 rifles to local population. As you
                        watched this thing over a period of time, did you keep coming up—there was a
                        technological answer to everything—did you find?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yeah, I think there was to some extent. There were always new things
                    that were going along. You mentioned the M-16s, and I mentioned earlier, those
                    special pebbles that were dropped along the Ho Chi Minh trail?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These sensors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Sensors that were suppose to detect movement. There was an outfit, I
                    think it was called “SOG”, Special Operations Group. It was part of the MACV
                    effort. They had a lot of technological things that they were trying out. Some
                    of the things in fact did work. Defoliation was another thing, I'm not aware
                    that defoliation was used militarily before the Vietnam war. So there were
                    searches for gimmicks like that but I don't think there was sudden great hope
                    that one of these things was going to win the war for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Tet, can you describe what happened when Tet hit.
                        Were you all called back? Can you kind of describe Tet day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I remember Tet day very clearly. My brother had come to town, he lived
                    in California, and I forget why he was in town. I think he was only here a day.
                    So we went out and had a big lunch, just wandered around talking, reminiscing a
                    bit and so forth. So I didn't get back to the office after this long lunch until
                    about 3:00 in the afternoon. All hell had broken loose.</p>
                <p>I got back and holy mackerel! Absolute hell had broken loose. I think we were
                    there in the office for the next, certainly, day and a half straight. I don't
                    think we saw much of home for quite a bit there, just trying to keep track of
                    all the different reports coming in. I think there was some telephoning from the
                    Embassy, very dramatic phone calls coming in, the whole thing became kind of a
                    blur as to what all had happened. But all these different reports of activity
                    and attacks all over the country were really amazing.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? I assume we are talking about
                        surprise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, tremendous surprise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? Now they've come out, we'll get
                        them. Or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It's hard to remember precisely what the views were. There was
                    certainly astonishment that they had been able to mount such an enormous attack
                    throughout the country, such a highly coordinated effort. I think there was
                    distress that they had as much success as they had. But then as reports began to
                    come in, it took a while for an understanding of the severity of the Viet Cong
                    military and infrastructural defeat. It took a while for that kind of
                    information to come in.</p>
                <p>When it did come, then we got some hope that this might really turn things
                    around. Because they did lose enormous numbers of their infrastructure, their
                    agents and their covert people, all of whom had surfaced for this one major
                    effort. Lots and lots of them were killed, captured or wounded. Over a period of
                    weeks rather than days, we began to feel that maybe they had been severely hurt.
                    But I think the initial feelings was that this was just a fantastic, dramatic
                    attack, that had had surprising success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the calculation? I mean, there's a certain point,
                        where you're dealing with the fires, as you're able to begin to look at
                        this, what did you feel was the rationale for this at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: As to why?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why they did it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Why did they do this? I think there's a lot of truth to the suggestion
                    that they thought that the populace would rise up with them and support them. In
                    fact, the populace, quite the contrary, in many cases showed a lot of bravery in
                    trying to repulse them and turn them back. So I think there was a severe
                    miscalculation on the part of the VC and the North Vietnamese. Otherwise, what
                    was the point in risking such a major loss of many of their forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I don't think that they were astute enough to have realized what a major impact
                    this would have on American public opinion. You hear that subsequently this
                    might have been one of the purposes, certainly that was one of the results. But
                    I doubt that they had the sophistication to figure that out—Aha! Westmoreland
                    made this speech, everybody is being very optimistic, now we'll punch in and
                    show them, Americans will lose heart and backout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You never can tell on these thing, they can go the other
                        way. Pearl Harbor is a good case in point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Exactly. But I don't think that was the case. I think it was more that
                    they had been saving up these enormous assets, significant assets that they had
                    throughout the country. They thought that when the people saw how many they
                    were, and where they were, and when they all surfaced and came out, I think they
                    believed their own propaganda that they were fighting to liberate South Vietnam
                    from the colonialists and the corrupt South Vietnamese government.</p>
                <p>In fact this didn't happen. In that sense, I think it was a miscalculation on
                    their part. I think the end result was far more significant. In the sense of
                    what it did to destroy American public opinion support for what we were trying
                    to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of public opinion support, here you were, you
                        were there during the really critical time when things were going up then
                        basically down, set the course for how it finally came out. You as an
                        individual, were you sensing the public mood, the protest and all this. How
                        did you feel about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think we did sense a lot of this. Many of us, myself included, did a
                    lot of public speaking both to groups here and around the country, going around
                    and trying to talk to all sorts of different groups. Certainly as time went on,
                    you got more and more a feeling, especially among young people at the
                    universities and elsewhere that there was rising opposition and a lack of
                    understanding of what was going on in the war.</p>
                <p>In fact, I guess the State Department, more than any other part of the
                    government, had to respond to congressional and public inquiries complaining
                    about one or another aspect of what was going on in the war. So we got a full
                    flavor of the disillusionment that seemed to be spreading about the war.</p>
                <p>I think I talked about this before, as to why the disillusionment came. In
                    essence it basically came back to the press, the media losing confidence in the
                    truthfulness or the ability of the administration, especially the people on the
                    ground in Saigon, to really understand what was going on and to tell the truth
                    to the reporters. The 5:00 Follies in Saigon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The 5:00 Follies being the press meeting that was held at
                        5:00.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Right, Barry Zorthian was the Mission Spokesman. I think there were
                    several incidents that pushed that forward. Things where the press knew what had
                    happened, and the Saigon mission attempted to, I don't think mislead them, but
                    at least to put a rosier hue on what had actually happened. Then the press doubt
                    was warranted. Gradually this built into a lot of cynicism and got worse and
                    worse. I think the journalists had a major impact on the American public.</p>
                <p>I think beyond that, the other significant factor of course, was TV. You could
                    sit at home and watch the evening news every night and here are these ghastly
                    pictures of what was happening in Vietnam. Of course the pictures were about
                    what had happened to the civilian side of things. Because of the limits on how
                    news was gathered, there was very little about what the VC and the North
                    Vietnamese had done and the kinds of things they were up to.</p>
                <p>So I think all of this built up in terms of the impact it had on people. I also
                    had the feeling, making talks to different groups, that as far as the colleges
                    were concerned, it wasn't so much the students as it was the instructors and
                    assistant professors, the younger professionals, who were the ones who were much
                    more vocal and strong against the administration efforts than the students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel, or did your group have any feel
                        about why they felt this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that maybe they felt that they were more sophisticated, for
                    whatever reason, they were more experienced and therefore felt they weren't
                    going to be sucked in by what the government was saying. Kind of an effort,
                    maybe perhaps to show off in front of their students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect there's a certain amount of that and a certain
                        amount of power. We're still suffering from that generation which are now
                        the full professors and have not done the educational process well, I'm
                        afraid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little feel, did you find that when you went
                        to universities to talk, did you get shouted down or have to deal with mobs
                        or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, I didn't have that kind of experience. I did have some unpleasant
                    experiences in terms of questioning and that kind of thing. But I never ran into
                    any mobs or severe attacks. I think the worst time I had was at Princeton, where
                    that famous professor, Falk, who's still around I think, who was vehemently
                    anti-administration to the extent that many of the things he was saying were
                    practically traitorous.</p>
                <p>I did go and talk to Princeton, I'm a Princeton graduate, and I talked to a group
                    up there and he was in the audience. Some of the questions or statements that he
                    made after I had spoken, were pretty bad. He flat out accused me of lying and
                    being a dupe of the government and trying to mislead the people. I forget
                    exactly what the argument was. But he just flat out made misstatements, and
                    accused me of being a corrupt supporter of the government, pretty distasteful.
                    But that didn't produce a great deal of support on the part of the students who
                    were listening. They let him have his say. I forget how I dealt with it but it
                    was primarily kind of ignoring what he said or trying to refute some of the
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel? Did you feel that you were on a pretty
                        short string as far as when you went out there, that you had to support the
                        administration line. I mean when questions would come up, would you give a
                        flat answer? Oh yeah, we're concerned about corruption or something like
                        this. Or did you feel that you had to present a rosy picture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, I didn't feel that I had to say that everything was great about
                    Vietnam. I think that I, as well as most of the people in the Working Group,
                    during the period that I was there until 1970, had the general feeling that what
                    we were doing was right. There were probably things that we could do better but
                    the cause was the right cause and eventually, we were going to be able to
                    win.</p>
                <p>I think it was only after I left working on Vietnam, that it later became clear
                    that we simply were not going to be able to do it. I didn't feel under any
                    pressure to make things sound better than they really were. We all had prepared
                    materials that we used in giving our talks, our speeches around the country. But
                    I didn't feel that it had to be presented more rosily than the facts
                    warranted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Nixon administration came in in 1969, did you
                        find a change in what we were doing, or attitude, with the new
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well of course the major difference when Nixon came in was that he had
                    talked about how he was going to end the war, and eventually the Vietnamization
                    program came along. That was a major change and effort, to shift more of the
                    burden towards the Vietnamese as opposed to our own troops. But as I recall,
                    even under Nixon, there continued to be an increase in the American troop level.
                    I think it was a small increase, we finally got up to about 550,000 troops. I
                    think that peak was reached after Nixon came into office.</p>
                <p>I might mention before we get to Nixon, that one of my most clear memories was of
                    March 1968, when there was a SEATO and seven-nation meeting, (Seven-nation being
                    the 7 countries that were supporting efforts in Vietnam with troops). I think in
                    Canberra or it could have been Wellington.</p>
                <p>We had one of the air force KC-135s, the so-called flying submarines that had no
                    windows so, you can't see out. Dean Rusk as the American chief-of-delegation and
                    Secretary of State, and Bill Bundy, who was the Assistant Secretary for East
                    Asian Affairs, went on the plane and I did too. I was going from the Working
                    Group, Though I was not yet in-charge of it.</p>
                <p>While we were on the plane, LBJ's famous speech in March 1968 was broadcast on
                    our way out there. Bundy had helped write it and he was sitting next to me on
                    the plane. Rusk was up in the forward compartment, sort of curtained off. The
                    speech was broadcast over the loudspeaker on the airplane, and it was a little
                    bit hard to hear but you could pick it up. Bundy was following along on the
                    speech that he had written. Then came the kicker there at the end when LBJ said
                    that he would not accept the nomination of his party and that he would not
                    run.</p>
                <p>There was a gasp on the plane and Bundy was clearly astonished. The curtain was
                    opened and there stood Dean Rusk with a big sort of grin on his face and he said
                    something to the effect—did that last part of the speech surprise anybody?
                    Obviously he had known it but nobody else had. Anyway, it was really dramatic to
                    hear it that way.</p>
                <p>Then we went on to the SEATO and 7-nation meeting which was not anything unusual
                    that I remember, the effort being to try to keep all the allies going
                    together.</p>
                <p>Then on the plane coming back, I think it was in Guam or Fiji, the word came that
                    Martin Luther King had been assassinated. As we flew back we landed at one of
                    the airbases near San Francisco and we heard reports of rioting in Washington,
                    and we were all concerned about that. Then as we flew into Andrews Air Force
                    Base, there were some small windows, as I said it was a flying submarine, but
                    there were some small windows where you could see out and we could see the smoke
                    rising behind the Capitol building.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Everybody was just aghast. When we landed the 82nd Airborne was on the ground at
                    Andrews Air Force Base and we were escorted back into town by military troops.
                    It was just an unbelievable experience to fly back like that. Then we got home
                    with everybody worried about what had happened to families and property.</p>
                <p>And of course the rioting did not reach the parts of the city that most of us
                    lived in. I lost a car in it, a little Fiat car that had been in a garage being
                    repaired, and it disappeared. But it was a really dramatic moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of my most vivid moments is seeing paratroopers in
                        helmets and flak jackets walking up and down Wisconsin Blvd.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Well back to this SEATO thing. How did we look upon the contributions. President
                    Johnson made a tremendous effort to get various countries. How did we feel, I
                    mean, there's the political component but how about the effectiveness or the
                    value of these troops?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I will come to that. I had an absolutely fascinating trip with General
                    Maxwell Taylor, who by then had left Vietnam as Ambassador and was basically
                    retired, although he continued to be an advisor to LBJ, and Clark Clifford. The
                    two of them were sent on a trip to the troop contributing nations to try to get
                    some more troops and to get greater support. Again, we went on one of these
                    special aircraft and it was just the two of them plus a fellow from the Defense
                    Department and myself. Just the four of us on this trip.</p>
                <p>We went to Saigon, Canberra, Seoul, Manila and also to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: So we went to all of these places and then we ended up back in Hawaii
                    to write our report. It was an absolutely fascinating trip to go with these men,
                    I'd known Taylor before but I had never met Clark Clifford. It was just a really
                    fascinating trip to be with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their impression of the value and the actual
                        contribution?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that the general feeling was that more important than the
                    actual material effect of the troops of the other countries, the more important
                    part of it was the psychological impact of the idea that it was not just the
                    United States that was fighting there, that there were allies that were
                    involved. I think that was the most significant angle, although it has to be
                    said that some of the troops were very good indeed. The Koreans were certainly
                    very tough, though they engaged in a great deal of illegal activities with PX
                    goods. The Filipinos were even worse in that sense. The Koreans were very brutal
                    and very cruel in how they enforced the rules in their particular sectors. I'm
                    surprised we didn't have more trouble than we did over the things that some of
                    the Koreans did. But I think it was primarily the fact that these were
                    additional nations that were supporting us, that they contributed, that was more
                    important than their actual effectiveness.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I think the result of this trip was that it clearly affected Clark
                    Clifford's views when he later became Secretary of Defense. We wrote our report
                    in Hawaii at an incredible place. I don't know if you know Fort Derussy?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right on Waikiki.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Right on Waikiki beach and that's where we wrote our report. Waikiki
                    beach was right in front of the little bitty house on the Fort. Maxwell Taylor
                    had his back to the beach and Clark Clifford was facing it, the Defense
                    Department guy and I were at opposite ends of the table. I remember that
                    Clifford would kick me under the table and wink whenever a pretty girl would
                    walk by on the beach.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we wrote a report for LBJ on the results of our efforts and I think we
                    did get some more troops, not anything significant but at least statements of
                    continuing support for what we were trying to do.</p>
                <p>One other funny thing happened in Saigon when we went into this very fancy room
                    in the Presidential Palace. President Thieu was there and General Ky was also as
                    Vice President. President Thieu greeted me most effusively and throughout the
                    meeting he kept looking over at me and winking and waving. I thought, what the
                    hell is going on? I had met him before but I didn't know him especially
                    well.</p>
                <p>It turned out that shortly before we were there, some months before, Secretary of
                    Agriculture Orville Freeman had been there. And of course, the names Freeman
                    Mathews and Orville Freeman are similar and, in fact, I do look a little bit
                    like him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You do.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: And he got us confused and he thought this was his old buddy, Orville
                    Freeman, who had brought in a lot of PL 480.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you know, these occidentals are kind of hard to
                        tell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: All these round-eyes look the same. Anyway, Taylor and Clifford were
                    quite impressed with my reception by President Thieu!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel say with the Nixon White House,
                        particularly with Henry Kissinger and all, that he was beginning to intrude,
                        to make changes there or not. Or was it pretty much business-as-usual for
                        the Working Group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well there was more emphasis on the Paris peace talks. They were trying
                    to get that moving ahead. I think gradually as time went on, the Vietnamization
                    program came into effect. There was a difference in the kinds of public
                    statements that were being made, in the sense that we would talk more about
                    trying to wind the war down, end American involvement. But that all came, it
                    seems to me, fairly gradually.</p>
                <p>I think from my perspective, I didn't see an enormous amount of change on the
                    ground as to what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All during this time, really from my guess '65 on, when
                        the Americans started coming in, was there any, trying to go back to the
                        period of time, any sort of disquiet on the part of those of us who were
                        dealing with, about the American military presence and the fact that we
                        tended to brush the Vietnamese aside and “lets us do it.” That this might be
                        sapping the ability and the will of the Vietnamese to carry the main burden
                        and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think the short answer is “yes,” especially those of us who had been
                    there earlier before the American involvement became so heavy. I think there was
                    a very definite feeling that we were placing too much emphasis on what we were
                    trying to do and not enough on trying to support the Vietnamese. I think I
                    mentioned the last time, that when I first went to Vietnam I had been the
                    Embassy representative to MACV, seeing all the efforts being made in trying to
                    advise the Vietnamese and in getting them better weapons.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Then when we came in the Vietnamese were just forgotten. I mean not totally
                    forgotten but they went way down on the priority list. Many of us continued to
                    feel that this was a big mistake, to not put enough effort on trying to keep the
                    Vietnamese going because after all, there was only a certain amount that the
                    foreign troops could do. We didn't have the language, it was a complicated
                    country, very hard to tell who was a friend and who was a foe. Then you
                    certainly needed the Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>I think the original idea was that we were going to take on the North Vietnamese
                    and a lot of the fighting against the Viet Cong would be done by the South
                    Vietnamese. That, before long, was forgotten. I think that there was very
                    definitely the impact that you're talking about, that many of the Vietnamese
                    decided—well, to hell with it, if the Americans are here, we'll let them take it
                    over.</p>
                <p>Part of it was that the Americans knew they were only going to be there for a
                    year and then they were out. The Vietnamese were there for the duration, right
                    to the end, so better let these guys take their chances, after all they only had
                    to do it for a year and then they'd be gone. The Vietnamese had their families
                    and everything else to lose.</p>
                <p>So I think this happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't feel Henry Kissinger's hand in the period
                        you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well of course, Kissinger had been in the Embassy in Vietnam, LBJ had
                    sent him out when I was in the Embassy. He came out and stayed for about three
                    weeks, he stayed actually with Dick Smyser in the Embassy. We got to know him
                    fairly well and he seemed like a very smart visiting professor type. So we had
                    known him and then he came to this great new eminence in the Nixon White
                    House.</p>
                <p>I think he pulled things together. It was very clear who was boss. I think one of
                    the problems of course was the distrust between Kissinger and Rogers. That I
                    think did cause some problems.</p>
                <p>Another one of my memories concerns the changeover, when the new Nixon
                    administration came into office in 1969. By then we had reached an agreement
                    with the North Vietnamese that they would not attack the cities. It was part of
                    the efforts during one of the bombing halts, that we wouldn't bomb North Vietnam
                    if they didn't attack the cities. Only a short period after the Nixon
                    administration came into office in January 1969, Nixon went off on a visit to
                    Europe, to France and England and elsewhere, and Rogers went with him, leaving
                    Elliot Richardson as Acting Secretary of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>On the night before they were to leave, the VC did attack Hue and Danang, two of
                    the cities that they had promised not to attack. Telegrams came in from Taylor
                    and Westmoreland, saying, we cannot permit this Vietnamese violation to go
                    unchallenged and therefore we must strike back at North Vietnam. So Bill Bundy
                    called me early in the morning at home and told me, to collect the cables from
                    the code room and meet Elliot Richardson at the Department and brief Richardson
                    in the car going out to the airport, where he was going to say goodbye to Nixon
                    and Rogers.</p>
                <p>I was supposed to give him whatever advice I could on what we should do in
                    response to these cables. I tore down to the Department, got the cables and rode
                    out in the car with Richardson. I explained what this was all about and here was
                    the recommendation from General Westmoreland and Ambassador Taylor, that we
                    should resume the bombing of North Vietnam immediately in response to these very
                    clear violations of the understanding. So we discussed this thoroughly.</p>
                <p>He finally decided that he would talk to Kissinger and Nixon and Rogers out there
                    at the airport, and then decide what to do. He never got a chance to do that, of
                    course. He got to the airport but with all the goodbyes, he had no chance to
                    raise it. In the end we didn't do anything about the attacks at the time because
                    he didn't want to take it on himself to go ahead and authorize a resumption of
                    the bombing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be really a major thing I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I can't remember now what the upshot of that was. I think, at least as
                    far as those attacks, we did nothing about that at the time. Later on we felt we
                    had to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything more we should cover on this Vietnam
                        working group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was a time of very long hours, fascinating work. On the Working
                    Group, we were not privy to all that was going on in the Paris peace talks. I
                    think certainly Bill Sullivan wasn't happy. The delegations were up to date on
                    it but they kept a lot of this to themselves and to Kissinger. So we weren't
                    fully briefed on that.</p>
                <p>One of our jobs was to keep the Paris delegation informed, and we backstopped
                    them in terms of material that they needed for speeches and that kind of thing.
                    So that was a pretty heavy chore to keep going. But in terms of what really was
                    going on, I think we were not all that privy. Of course, during that period we
                    didn't reach any definitive results.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing much. The line of communication was open and that
                        was about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That was about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1970 and then you went off in quite a
                        different world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: After 6 years in Vietnam, I finally escaped to Mexico City. That was a
                    bit of a fight too because I was only an FSO-3 at this point. I think the job in
                    Mexico City as Political Counselor was an FSO-1 job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It certainly would be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Bob McBride, who had been in Madrid when I was there, went on to Paris
                    as DCM. He was the new Ambassador to Mexico and he'd taken a liking to us and
                    also to Nancy, my wife. Anyway, he pressed very hard to have me go to Mexico
                    City and eventually won.</p>
                <p>I didn't quite realize it at the time but it caused quite a stink because there
                    were lots of old ARA hands who had their eyes on that job. They thought it was
                    disgraceful this outsider got it, but I had a wonderful three years in Mexico
                    City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '70 to '73. First place, could you describe how Robert
                        McBride operated as Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was a very professional ambassador, he had an excellent sense of
                    humor. He tended to have firm opinions about people, both people working on the
                    staff and local citizens. As far as the people on the staff were concerned, he
                    tended to believe that they were going to be good people unless he found out
                    otherwise. Once he found out otherwise then you were in real trouble. But he
                    generally tended to be very fair and to be supportive.</p>
                <p>As far as Mexicans were concerned, he liked the Mexicans, and had a number of
                    good friends. I think that he probably tended to cultivate the wealthier upper
                    class Mexicans to the, not to the exclusion, but to the detriment of contacts
                    with lower level people in and outside the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>He ran a very good Embassy, there was no doubt who was in charge. His DCMs were
                    Jack Kubisch first and then Bob Dean. Bob McBride, I think, was a very popular
                    Ambassador there. He could give the impression of being aloof but in fact he was
                    a very caring man and those who got to know him really appreciated him. Jackie
                    McBride was a charming, entertaining woman but she could also be rather
                    imperious and demanding when she wanted. Among other things, they both felt that
                    when people were invited to the residence, they were there to work, they weren't
                    there to enjoy the party. There were several occasions on which Mrs. McBride
                    made that pretty clear.</p>
                <p>She and my wife got along very well indeed, and that helped smooth things along.
                    We had a wonderful time there with them. I think it was partly the relationship
                    between the wives, but anyway, Nancy and I did a fair amount of traveling around
                    the country with the McBrides, as well as with the USIA Public Affairs
                    Counselor, George Rylance and his wife, Betty. The 6 of us plus the Ambassador's
                    aide would travel around the country, primarily because McBride wanted to see
                    what was happening in the countryside, and of course it was useful to us too to
                    have this opportunity.</p>
                <p>McBride had Mexican government protection. He had very tough special agents that
                    were assigned to him and they traveled all over. In many places, they made
                    things easier because if we needed a reservation for dinner in some place, these
                    guys made sure that we got it. I remember the chief agent was named Inocencio
                    and it was certainly a misnomer. He was maybe the least innocent looking fellow
                    you ever saw; he was a really tough looking man. They were very good.</p>
                <p>We had a great time. The other people in the Embassy were also nice. It was my
                    first job really, at least abroad, of running a large section. I was the
                    Political Counselor and ran the political section. We had some very good people
                    there working with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First place, what were the major issues during this '70 to
                        '73 period in Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The major issue that I spent a majority of my time on was the old
                    problem of the salinity of the Colorado River. This was a very complicated issue
                    that I learned more and more about as time went on. It basically had to do with
                    the fact that we were meeting the requirements of the 1944 Water Treaty with
                    Mexico in terms of quantity-a million and a half acre-feet of water a year out
                    of the Colorado River. But the treaty said nothing about the quality of the
                    water and the United States was, I think, very much at fault in delivering poor
                    water to Mexico and doing so deliberately.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>We built a dam at Yuma, Arizona to direct the run-off water from some of the
                    agricultural districts, particularly one in Arizona called the Wellton Mohawk
                    Irrigation District, which had very saline water. We built a separate canal so
                    that that water did not go back into the Colorado River to pollute the water
                    that was being used elsewhere on the US border. But it went straight to the
                    Mexican border at Yuma and then on into Mexico as part of the water deliveries.
                    So the result was that Mexico got quite poor water.</p>
                <p>Another problem had been that when the Water Treaty was agreed to in 1944, one
                    and a half million acre-feet of water was very easily met by the US side because
                    there had been a number of years when there had been a lot of snow packed up in
                    the mountains and the US needs were a lot lower. So a million and a half
                    acre-feet of water didn't seem all that much. But by 1970, for primarily
                    irrigation reasons but also, for climatic reasons, there was less water going
                    into the river. US uses had increased and therefore we could not afford, at
                    least from the standpoint of the 7 basin states that used the water, we couldn't
                    afford to give Mexico any more than the one and a half million acre-feet.</p>
                <p>So they got exactly what they were entitled to and no more and a good bit of the
                    water was this run-off that was not good. So they had a legitimate complaint but
                    it became a very difficult technical and political issue. The International
                    Boundary and Water Commission, with the Commissioners being in El Paso and
                    Ciudad Juarez on the US and Mexico side, were very much involved in it. They
                    attempted to resolve it but they got nowhere.</p>
                <p>It became a very heavy political issue between the two countries, especially
                    because, just before I got to Mexico, before McBride and I got there, we had
                    signed the final agreement of the Boundary Treaty to settle the famous Chamizal
                    boundary dispute near Ciudad Juarez and El Paso that came about because the Rio
                    Grande does not stay in its banks and keeps shifting. That issue had been
                    resolved and that left the water issue as the major issue between the two
                    countries, although there were also pollution problems and other things along
                    the border.</p>
                <p>So I spent a lot of time working on the things that had to do with the border
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you dealt with the border issue, but in a way
                        I can see something like this would be so completely out of the State
                        Department's hands. One, more than anything else that's local politics, it's
                        Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, the whole thing. Water of course is
                        the guts of what the West was interested in, that reflects in Washington
                        with very powerful Senators and all this. Then you have a Water Commission.
                        I mean, what could you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was a fascinating job, unlike any other I think in the Foreign
                    Service, there was so much US domestic political angle to it. We of course were
                    not setting policy, we were making recommendations, trying to find ways to get
                    these things resolved. We were reporting on what the Mexican Foreign Office was
                    saying about it, trying to keep an eye on what the Mexican Boundary Commissioner
                    was saying, up in El Paso.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of close dealings with the US Commissioner, a wonderful man named
                    Joseph Friedkin, who served many years as US Boundary and Water Commissioner. A
                    very expert technical guy but he had diplomatic skills in the sense that he was
                    always very straightforward and he would establish a very clear working
                    relationship with his opposite number, the Mexican Commissioner.</p>
                <p>But our job in the embassy was to report the pressures that were being exerted by
                    the Mexican government, not just the Foreign Office but also the Ministry of
                    Hydraulic Resources, which is what their water department is called.</p>
                <p>Then finally, because this effort went on the whole time I was there, President
                    Nixon appointed Herbert Brownell, former Attorney General, as his Special
                    Representative to come down and try to reach an agreement to resolve the water
                    problem. And he came and I spent a lot of time with Brownell, who turned out to
                    be a very interesting, very decent human being.</p>
                <p>We traveled together up to the Mexicali Valley which is where the major
                    complaints were, that's where the Colorado River water came down in to Mexico.
                    In fact the Colorado River no longer reached the Gulf of California because it's
                    all dried up; the water is all used. .</p>
                <p>We took a bus trip up through the Mexicali Valley and every time we came to a
                    crossroads there'd be farmers—the Mexican government had laid this on
                    there—there'd be farmers out there showing this white earth with all the salt in
                    it and poor old Brownell would have to get off the bus. He'd stand there and
                    these farmers would harangue him about the terrible water, we can't grow our
                    tomatoes, this is terrible and so on. This was an all day trip through the
                    Mexicali Valley and all these irate farmers harassing us.</p>
                <p>We had a number of negotiations with the two Commissioners and with the Mexican
                    foreign ministry and with the Secretariat of the Hydraulic Resources and
                    Brownell. He came back and forth several times. He did a lot of negotiating back
                    in Washington with Senators from the border states. Eventually we reached an
                    agreement on what we could do, which essentially involved the US government
                    agreeing to set a water quality standard. We would try to provide water no worse
                    than the water that came out of, Lake Powell, and it involved our agreeing to
                    build an enormous desalinization plant in Yuma, Arizona so that the water
                    delivered to Mexico was of decent quality.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>And that's how it was resolved and I think that plant has finally come on-line.
                    Another thing that helped was that the climate changed and we got more snow
                    packed up in the mountains so there was more water coming down.</p>
                <p>I think the issue is still a hot one with the seven basin states because in the
                    meantime, something called the Central Arizona Project has come on-line. That
                    means a further increase in the use of water by Arizona, water that had been
                    allocated to Arizona under the seven basin state compact up until then was going
                    to California but was agreed to be rightfully water due to Arizona. And Arizona
                    put this enormous agricultural project on-line and now California is really
                    short of water and that's why there is all this talk is of trying to take water
                    from the Columbia River down to Southern California. So the issue of water in
                    the West is still very active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Mexican authorities.
                        First, what was your impression of their Ministry of Foreign Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Very interesting because they were, in a sense, maybe more
                    anti-American than most of the Mexican people were. I don't mean this in a sense
                    that they were viciously anti-American and pro-Soviet. They had an acute sense
                    of the importance of their own sovereignty. Of course the US over the years has
                    trampled on their sovereignty with a fair amount of impunity. I think the
                    Mexican foreign ministry felt they had to be alert all the time to anything that
                    the US was doing that might be a problem for their sovereignty.</p>
                <p>I remember one of the issues that came up was remote sensing from our satellites,
                    with the idea that the satellites were going overhead, and they were taking
                    remote sensing pictures of the whole earth. The embassy was instructed to reach
                    an agreement with the Mexicans on providing the Mexican government with
                    satellite photographs of their land. And I think primarily it was a no-cost
                    thing to them but we simply wanted to know what areas they most liked and what
                    kinds of infrared and so forth.</p>
                <p>The Mexican foreign office was just outraged that the United States was taking
                    pictures of their sovereign country. It took a lot of explaining that we were
                    doing this to the Soviet Union too, to everybody. It wasn't an attempt to be
                    invasive, we were tying to be helpful. So in that sense, I think the Mexicans
                    were very alert to anything that might suggest that we weren't being respectful
                    of their rights.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of other issues like fishery agreements, and I mentioned sanitation
                    and pollution along the border. When we first got there also, this was the
                    period when Mr. Kleindienst was Deputy Attorney General, and he started
                    Operation Intercept—to catch Mexicans going into to the US with drugs. That
                    caused a furor. At the border, we also had a big anti- narcotics program with
                    DEA agents all over the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>There were numerous efforts to try to get Mexican support on international issues
                    at the UN. We spent a lot of time on that. They were not all that
                    supportive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought, I mean I've heard this before, that
                        the foreign ministry has always been the province of turning it over, you
                        might say, to the leftist side, not necessarily Marxist, but to the leftist
                        side sort of for the academics and all this. And this is where they put
                        their people. The rest of the government is really a very pragmatic
                        government and this is one that really doesn't cause much trouble. Because
                        Mexico really doesn't have many foreign problems, it's their own sandbox
                        where they can play. But I would have thought too that the UN would be a
                        wonderful place for Mexico to tweak the nose of Uncle Sam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that's true, especially the people who dealt with UN affairs
                    often were quite difficult. I think a lot of that was true.</p>
                <p>Another issue that we spent a lot of time on was Cuba because the Mexicans were
                    very much more friendly to Cuba then we thought was appropriate. We tried to
                    work on that. Of course one of the major efforts of our sister agency there was
                    targeting the Cubans and the Soviets and the Eastern Europeans and what they
                    were up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My impression is, from things that have come out, that the
                        reason the CIA had very good relations in Mexico, I mean the intelligence
                        agencies got along beautifully without maybe telling their superiors how
                        well they were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think they did. We had a very good relationship. I think the
                    relations between the political sections in Mexico City was probably the best of
                    any place that I'd been. Although it was pretty good in Cairo too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you have a one-party system and today, March 24th,
                        we've just had a tragedy where the candidate for PRI was assassinated. But
                        what was your impression of the Mexican political situation and how as the
                        Political Counselor did you deal with it and what were the interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We tried to keep track of what was going on in the PRI. We had a couple
                    of excellent political reporters that worked on internal Mexican affairs, Bob
                    Service notable among them. We tried to report on what was happening with the
                    PRI. The opposition parties during the time that I was there were not very
                    strong, were not very highly regarded. I don't think they had much popular
                    support either.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>There was no doubt that the PRI succeeded in winning elections throughout the
                    country by fair means or foul, whatever was needed. I don't think the opposition
                    was very strong against them. It was primarily the PAN, the right-wing party,
                    and that didn't have a great deal of political support. The major influence of
                    the opposition parties was to some extent, to keep the PRI somewhat honest in
                    what they were trying to do.</p>
                <p>While we were there I think there was some progress made in the greater openness
                    of the party but it still was a one-party system. I think it's interesting that
                    it's changing now, it's very clear that things have changed. Luis Echeverria was
                    the President throughout the time that I was there. I think he became a
                    disappointment to a lot of people. He turned out not to be as honest as we had
                    hoped he would be.</p>
                <p>One thing that did change, that we tried to work on, was population policy.
                    Echeverria had come into office saying that—to govern is to populate—the more
                    people the better. On a trip three years into his administration, he made a trip
                    to Chile to visit Allende. His Secretary of Finance, who had been Ambassador to
                    Washington, went on the plane with him.</p>
                <p>The Mexican population people had worked very hard to provide the Secretary of
                    Finance with some charts that showed what was happening to Echeverria's plans to
                    increase productivity, increase land and agricultural products, increase health,
                    etc., all sorts of different things. The charts showed what was happening
                    because of the population explosion. It showed that it didn't matter what
                    government money was put into these programs so long as the population kept
                    increasing at the rate it was going, things were going to continue to get worse
                    in Mexico.</p>
                <p>The Minister of Finance, whose name was Hugo Margain, convinced Echeverria on
                    this airplane trip to Chile and back, that he was going to have to change his
                    policy. And he did, he turned it 180 degrees, so that Echeverria came out in
                    support of population control. In fact, by the time we'd left, they had produced
                    some very good cartoons that appeared on television, that made fun of Mexican
                    machismo and the idea of more children.</p>
                <p>I think this was a major development that we had some input from the Embassy. We
                    helped the population come up with figures and that kind of thing. So that was a
                    major change.In terms of other political events, this was a period when there
                    were guerrillas in the state of Guerrero from time to time, causing
                    disturbances. The Mexican government had some trouble trying to capture them and
                    keep track of them because they could disappear into the hills pretty easily.
                    This is more bandits than anything else, it was not like what has been happening
                    in Chiapas in recent days.</p>
                <p>One other event that happened while I was in Mexico was a kidnaping. Our Consul
                    General in Guadalajara, Terry Leonhardy, was kidnaped on his way to the office
                    one day. This was in 1973, the Spring of '73, just before I left. I was then
                    sent down from the Embassy to Guadalajara to try to figure out how to get him
                    back, what to do, how to coordinate this.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>What happened was that the kidnappers first claimed that they were doing this for
                    political purposes, to demonstrate that they wanted greater freedom, release of
                    political prisoners, and so forth. But very soon it became apparent that really
                    they were looking for money and they wanted a substantial amount. The only way
                    that the kidnappers would communicate with either the government or us was
                    through Leonhardy's wife in the residence, using the residence phone, and there
                    was only one phone in there. So when I got to Guadalajara the first thing I did
                    was to get the Governor to put in another telephone line so that we could have
                    our own line running to the Embassy or to Washington to keep track; otherwise
                    that other line would have been tied up.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of back and forth. The Mexican government said eventually
                    that—alright, we'll meet the demands of the kidnappers, we'll pay the money but
                    we don't want it to appear that we're paying it; we want to leave it fuzzy as to
                    who paid for it. So this was a very tense three days of phone calls back and
                    forth between the kidnappers only to Mrs. Leonhardy. She was a remarkable woman,
                    showed a lot of guts in trying to deal with this.</p>
                <p>It was a really weird situation because the Consul General, from Monterrey, was
                    also sent down to try and help out. Everybody ended up in the residence, nobody
                    dared to leave because this was the only activity going on. And we kept getting
                    messages back and forth from the kidnappers on what they wanted and where this
                    was going to happen, and we made attempts to make sure that Terry was still
                    alive and put him on the phone a couple of times. So it was a pretty hairy three
                    days or so.</p>
                <p>When finally the Mexican government did agree to provide the money, it was
                    wrapped in newspapers. The idea was that one of the local employees was to get
                    on a bus and ride on the bus until some signal occurred and then he was to turn
                    the money over to somebody on the bus who was to be identified somehow and then
                    Terry was to be released later. This was all pretty tricky but it was the
                    Mexican government's money.</p>
                <p>Meantime from Washington, we kept getting instructions from, Bob Hurwitch who was
                    Deputy Assistant Secretary in ARA. Hurwitch kept insisting that we could not
                    negotiate with the terrorists and he went to the extent of suggesting, that we
                    were not to allow the Mexicans to negotiate with them. Bob McBride by this time
                    had gotten ill and wasn't there but Bob Dean, who was the DCM, was the Charg� in
                    Mexico City. He kept telling Hurwitch, all right, do you want me to go in and
                    tell the Mexican government they are not to make any effort to get him back? No,
                    no, we don't want to do that, but you go on and tell them that we don't
                    negotiate.</p>
                <p>So Dean went in and told the Foreign Minister that we don't negotiate and their
                    response was—do you want your man back or don't you? So this kept going back and
                    forth, kind of silly arguments about whether we were negotiating or not. But
                    eventually the Mexicans said, in effect, to hell with it. They went ahead and
                    agreed to provide the money.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Sure enough after about three days, the money was turned over by this complicated
                    business of riding around on a bus. Leonhardy suddenly appeared on some street
                    corner and came back in not too much the worse for wear. That was my first
                    direct experience with a kidnaping, and it was pretty dramatic. We finally did
                    get him back but it was quite tricky because the kidnappers would talk to only
                    Mrs. Leonhardy and only over that one phone line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Mexican officialdom that you
                        had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think they're pretty competent people. The lower level, if you're
                    talking about the police on the corner, there's the old problem that their pay
                    is so low that they couldn't possibly survive so they have to get “mordidas” and
                    that kind of thing. But the other people that I dealt with, were generally
                    pretty competent people. Their diplomats, their technical people in the Ministry
                    of Hydraulic Resources, the Boundary Water Commission people, they all, were
                    pretty competent people. They were basically friendly too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was really much of a, I've heard

                        sort of the ruling group in Mexico City has its own cast which is looking
                        much more suspiciously on the United States and all this, El Norte. But when
                        you get up to the whole border area, I mean this is a big, we're not just
                        talking about border but into Monterrey and much of their industrial area
                        there, that it's quite a different society and cast of mind.</hi>

                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that's entirely true. The area in Northern Mexico, as you say
                    extends not just to the Maquilladores on the border but considerably farther
                    south. There are so many more dealings with the United States and there are so
                    much closer relationships. They are far more friendly and they are far less
                    sensitive about this idea of their own sovereignty than the officials down in
                    Mexico City.</p>
                <p>But even down into Mexico City, there are lots and lots of people, particularly
                    the wealthier people, who for any kind of medical problem would go to the States
                    to get that taken care of. The shopping trips, continual movement back and forth
                    between Mexico and the United States. And the strong feeling of
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also for much higher education, that's where you go for
                        graduate degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Lots and lots of people going to the US for education of one kind or
                    another. I think in general the Mexican feeling about the United States was
                    really a very positive one.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>There were certainly leftists and some of the press especially, Excelsior, the
                    most prominent Mexico City newspaper, was quite leftist. I think in general
                    there was a very favorable view of the United States and a supportive view of
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>I haven't been back there since the fall of the Soviet Union. It'd be interesting
                    to see what happened there because the Soviets were quite active in Mexico. They
                    received some sympathy from the Mexicans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the Cuban problem? They were kind of
                        for Castro and we were against Castro.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There wasn't much effort on our part to try to convince the Mexicans
                    that they were wrong. From time to time when some egregious things that the
                    Cubans had done would happen, we'd take great glee in pointing that out. I think
                    most of the activity as far as the Cubans were concerned, the Embassy tried to
                    keep an eye on what they were up to and to counter whatever propaganda they were
                    trying to put forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Q: I take it that this was a period of time when the Nixon
                        administration was not putting much emphasis on Mexico. It had lots of other
                        fish to fry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well, I don't know. Nixon made a trip to Puerto Vallarta soon after I
                    got there, about the first thing that happened, I guess. There was the Amistad
                    Dam and all sorts of things, efforts that were made to try to be friendly to
                    Mexico. But at the same time we had Kleindienst's Operation Intercept.</p>
                <p>The other side of that was the effort that was made to try to resolve some of the
                    boundary problems, especially water, such as the gesture of appointing Herbert
                    Brownell, a close friend of Nixon, to come down to solve the water problem. So I
                    think there were efforts on the part of the Nixon administration as to Henry
                    Kissinger, I don't think that he thought that Latin America was at the top of
                    his list of priorities.I don't think this is a apocryphal story. Kissinger came
                    to Mexico for some meeting, and while he was there a telegram came in from
                    Europe about MBFR. He couldn't find anybody on the delegation who had
                    accompanied him or anybody down there who knew what the initials stood for, or
                    anything about the issue of Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions. So he said,
                    “The hell with these specialists, you people are too specialized.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heard that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's why the Department started the Global Outlook Program which is
                    in turn how I ended up on the Egyptian desk.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the fall of Allende?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I don't think so, I left there in June of '73, I can't remember when
                    Allende was, I think it was later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the political section, how important were our
                        consulates, from your point of view. They are obviously important for
                        commercial purposes and for immigration purposes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We got some useful information out of the consulates but I have to say,
                    not a great deal. I'm sorry to see the reduction in the number of consulates in
                    Mexico. I don't know what there are now, certainly a lot fewer than what there
                    used to be.</p>
                <p>In terms of the reporting that came in, I don't think there was a great deal of
                    reporting. Most of the consulates were so busy dealing with consular problems
                    that they didn't have a lot of time for that. But when we had a consular
                    conference where they pulled all the Consuls General into a meeting; or if you
                    traveled around the country and stopped in at the consulates, you often got
                    pretty useful insights into what the thinking was in the area and what was going
                    on politically. But in terms of reporting, I don't think there was much of great
                    use to the embassy.</p>
                <p>I think it's too bad to have a reduction of our presence, it reduces the impact
                    that the United States has on a foreign country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On these ties, they often get lost when you just turn out
                        these mega-consulates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about illegal immigration, did this play much of a
                        role or cause problems for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think it was an issue that the Mexicans felt torn about. In a sense
                    they were kind of embarrassed that there were so many of their own citizens who
                    preferred to abandon Mexico and go to the United States and all the implications
                    that had for the fact that life in Mexico was not all that good. At the same
                    time they were upset at the treatment that many of their citizens got in the
                    United States because they were illegal immigrants. They hated pictures of our
                    immigration people, the border patrol, capturing Mexicans trying to swim the
                    river and all that kind of thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>So I think there was a dual view there and from time to time there would be
                    protests about one thing or another that would happen with our people. But I
                    think the basic view of the Mexicans was that so long as there was such a
                    difference in the standard of living between the two countries, it was only
                    natural that a lot of the Mexicans were going to try to get to the United States
                    to have a better life.</p>
                <p>I'm a great supporter of NAFTA and I think over time we're going to see some
                    improvements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North America Free Trade Agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think over time this is going to have a major difference in improving
                    the standard of living between the two countries. The fact is there are lots and
                    lots of Mexicans down there who would like to come to this country. I think
                    basically they make good citizens but the question is, how many of them do we
                    want?</p>
                <p>Operation Intercept of Mr. Kleindienst was, I think, basically an attempt to get
                    the Mexican's attention, and to make them realize that we were serious about
                    trying to do something about drugs. But the attitude among the immigration
                    people and among the customs people became very anti-Mexican and, I think,
                    unwarrantedly so.</p>
                <p>We had the terrible experience that the daughter of the Foreign Minister, was
                    twice body searched in Miami on her way to the States. She was subjected to very
                    unpleasant treatment by the customs people. You can imagine the furor. Emilio
                    Rabasa, who was the Foreign Minister, and was not particularly pro-American to
                    begin with, when this happened, was even worse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So these were sort of brush fires that you would

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There were a lot of brush fires. But it was a fascinating place and we
                    made a lot of good friends there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: In 1973, in the Summer of '73, I came back and went into the senior
                    seminar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 7, 1994. So we have you going into the
                        senior seminar then going to the Egyptian desk from '74 to '76. Would you
                        explain how that came about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Well there was something called the Global Outlook Program, GLOP. My
                    understanding is that this came from Henry Kissinger having gone to a conference
                    in Mexico as Secretary of State. A cable came in from Europe talking about MBFR
                    and Henry couldn't find anybody who knew what the initials stood for, let alone
                    what some of the policy behind it was. So he was kind of outraged and thought
                    there was far too much specialization among these Latin American employees and
                    therefore he decided that there ought to be a spreading out of talent, different
                    people in different bureaus so there wasn't too much concentration.</p>
                <p>So, at about the time I was coming out of the senior seminar, each bureau was
                    required to take on somebody who had never worked in the bureau before. I ended
                    up on the Egyptian desk, Country Director for Egypt, never having set foot in
                    Egypt and not knowing a thing about it. The only time I had been in the Middle
                    East even, was spending one night in Beirut en route from Saigon to Madrid.</p>
                <p>Anyway, it was a fascinating time because this was just after the '73 war. We
                    were just beginning to establish relations. So I came on to the desk in June
                    '74. Hermann Eilts had arrived shortly after the war but didn't become
                    Ambassador until the Spring when the Egyptians and ourselves decided to exchange
                    ambassadors.</p>
                <p>Hermann was Ambassador in Cairo, and the Spanish flag was finally hauled down off
                    our embassy there, having been there for 7 years during the time we had no
                    relations. It was a very active period because we were anxious to take advantage
                    of the momentum that had been started by our having brought about the end of the
                    war through diplomacy, to try to make a new breakthrough in our relations with
                    Egypt and with the whole Middle East. So it was a fascinating period to have
                    been on the desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you come up to speed? I mean here you are, the
                        Middle East has sort of been the minefield for the foreign service for 50
                        years or more, so here you are in there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: If I had had greater advance notice that I was going on the Egyptian
                    desk, having been in the senior seminar I could have spent a lot of time reading
                    about Egypt and trying to get myself prepared. But I only found out about this
                    something like three weeks before the seminar ended. The seminar by the way, was
                    maybe the best year I had in the foreign service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you concentrate on anything particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We always had to write a senior paper and I wrote mine on international
                    water problems drawing on my experiences in Mexico with the Colorado River.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I wrote a paper on three water problems. One that I hoped was in the past, namely
                    the Colorado River problem because that had been, we thought, resolved with the
                    efforts of Herbert Brownell and the agreement we finally reached with Mexico on
                    quality of water of the Colorado River. The second problem, the more current
                    one, had to do with something called the Garrison Diversion Project in North
                    Dakota, which would involve diverting water out of the Missouri River into a
                    small tributary called the Souris River which flows into Canada.</p>
                <p>A big dam would have been built called the Garrison Dam. It would have had major
                    ecological and other impacts on North Dakota and further down the river. Among
                    other things, it would have diverted water into the Souris flowing north into
                    Canada and on into Hudson Bay. This would have brought what they call,
                    biota—microorganisms—from the Missouri River and American rivers such as the
                    Mississippi and others that flow down into the Gulf of Mexico, north into
                    Canada, which had not had experience with these kinds of organisms from this
                    system.</p>
                <p>Furthermore the water would not have been high quality water, it would have been
                    run-off water. And unlike with Mexico, our agreement with Canada on water did
                    include provisions dealing with quality. In effect it said we should not divert
                    waters from one country into the other that would adversely affect the quality
                    of water in the other.</p>
                <p>There were also impacts from the proposed Garrison Diversion on a lot of wildlife
                    in North Dakota. It's an area where there's are numerous flyways for birds
                    flying north and south. And there was considerable controversy about the whole
                    project.</p>
                <p>I ended up going to Canada and talking to people in the Canadian government in
                    Ottawa; going to Winnipeg and Manitoba which is where some of the water would
                    have ended up; and then going into North Dakota a state I'd never been before. I
                    spent about two weeks driving all around North Dakota talking to farmers and all
                    sorts of people. Fascinating experience. Then I came back and ended up writing
                    the paper.</p>
                <p>The paper then got distributed to a lot of people in Canada and North Dakota that
                    I had spoken to. It caused something of a furor because it became a domestic
                    political issue in several races in North Dakota. I was accused of having
                    interfered in one side or the other there. One of the Congressmen complained
                    that I was going to cause his defeat because he had been in favor of the
                    Garrison Diversion and I'd come out strongly against it.</p>
                <p>So it was a very fun sort of paper. The other part of the paper dealt with a
                    possible future water problem which concerned the waters of the Usamasintra
                    River that rises in Guatemala and flows into Mexico. They had no agreement on
                    what ought to be done with that water.</p>
                <p>I flew down to Guatemala and talked with the Guatemalans. Frank Meloy was
                    Ambassador at the time, one of the last times I saw Frank before he was
                    assassinated in Beirut. Anyway, it was a fun time. The whole year was a really
                    good year. This is kind of a diversion.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>But I did not know I was going on to the Egyptian desk until a few weeks before
                    the end of the course. If I had known, I could have done a lot of reading, even
                    perhaps written my paper about something to do with Egypt. I could have written
                    it on the Nile which a later member of the senior seminar, Richard Benedict did.
                    He wrote his paper on the Nile and came to Cairo and visited us. He wrote a
                    wonderful paper, and excellent paper.</p>
                <p>Anyway, how I got up to speed on Egypt was more by osmosis than any other kind of
                    process. It was one of those things where you get plunged into it and you begin
                    to learn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would the Director of Egyptian Affairs be doing, what
                        were your main concerns, what did you do in the '74-'76 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: As I said earlier, the major effort was to try to build a relationship
                    with Egypt that would be lasting and that would turn the Egyptians towards peace
                    with Israel and away from war. Henry Kissinger was tremendously interested in
                    what was going on with Egypt. In a sense, he was almost the desk officer, so it
                    meant that practically everything I did had a very close eye from him on what
                    was happening.</p>
                <p>I had several very good bosses above me. The hierarchy was from Kissinger to Joe
                    Sisco who was the Under Secretary for Political Affairs; Roy Atherton was the
                    Assistant Secretary for Near East and South Asian Affairs; and Hal Saunders was
                    his Deputy and the one to whom I basically reported. So those were all very
                    highly qualified, very excellent people, especially Hal Saunders whom I had
                    tremendous respect for.</p>
                <p>A major part of our efforts involved dealing with the Congress on their interests
                    on what was going on in Egypt. A lot of effort was put into trying to coordinate
                    the different aspects of our relationship.</p>
                <p>There was not much of a military relationship during that early period. Kissinger
                    was very leery of trying to encourage the Egyptians on that side. On the other
                    hand, the Egyptians were very anxious to get the benefit of our military
                    expertise and our military weapons. Sadat was fond of saying that Egypt had
                    beaten the Israelis. It was only when the United States entered the war, as he
                    called it, on the Israeli side that they were able to overcome the initial
                    Egyptian advances. That's not entirely true, but there is something to it.</p>
                <p>Of course with the new relationship, our military was very anxious to get in
                    there, to get a foot in the door. They had dreams of glory as to what the
                    military could do there. So there was a lot of trying to keep them under
                    control. In fact, Kissinger had laid down a rule that there were to be no high
                    level visits to Egypt unless he personally approved. This stuck in the craw of
                    the Pentagon considerably because they really wanted to send a lot of people
                    over there.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Then there was of course the AID program that began to build up. That was
                    something that we tried to keep a close eye on too. A Man named Bob Nooter was
                    the Assistant Administrator for the Near East, an excellent fellow.</p>
                <p>Then there were all the problems of a growing mission in Egypt. When Hermann got
                    there, he was the seventh American in what was then the American Interests
                    Section of the Spanish Embassy. It gradually grew over the years, much to
                    Herman's disgust. He didn't believe in large staffs and he resisted every
                    increment.</p>
                <p>In the beginning it was clearly necessary to beef up the staff and they had
                    myriad problems. So I was much involved in a lot of the backstopping of the
                    embassy there—trying to get more people assigned there; backstopping them on
                    housing; and all sorts of day-to-day aspects of development.</p>
                <p>One way in which I tried to get up to speed on what was happening there was to
                    get out on an orientation trip as soon as I could. I was able to do that fairly
                    early on, and I went to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria but I didn't go to
                    Lebanon. That helped to give me an initial idea of what the area was like. It
                    was very valuable to have done that and it was also a way to meet Hermann and to
                    see what the embassy looked like.</p>
                <p>As time went on, I guess the major event that took place during my tour as
                    Country Director was President Sadat's visit to this country. This was in 1975
                    and was the first visit by an Egyptian Chief of State ever to this country. So
                    it was really played high in the headlines. As I said earlier, Henry Kissinger
                    was very much involved in everything that had to do with Egypt. So he kept an
                    extremely close eye on everything that had to do with that visit. He really
                    wanted it to be a whopping success. He got into all sorts of details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give any examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He personally inspected all the public statements that were drafted. He
                    checked all the menus, he checked guest lists of people who were invited to
                    dinners and things. We had two or three meetings with him with Protocol on the
                    issue of where the Egyptians might hold their return dinner after the White
                    House dinner, the formal dinner, because this was a State Visit. He had all
                    sorts of ideas as to where the return dinner might be held because he was
                    anxious that this be a unique occasion.</p>
                <p>One idea he had was to try to have it in the Botanic Gardens by the Capitol. I
                    went down there and looked at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There isn't any room.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It's not a good place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a hot house.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It's a hot house. It would involve moving a lot of plants to make room
                    for this. So we searched all over and ended up having the return dinner in the
                    Headquarters of the Order of the Cincinnati on Massachusetts Ave., more or less
                    opposite the Cosmos Club. It did turn out to be a big success.</p>
                <p>But the whole visit was extraordinarily exciting. These were questions of where
                    the various events would take place, who was going to be at the airport, all
                    that sort of detail. It was very highly concentrated, long, long hours, trying
                    to keep track of all of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was President Ford at that time. Were you involved as a
                        note-taker or anything else at any of the meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No I wasn't. Henry, because of his extreme interest in this, usually
                    insisted that either Joe Sisco or Roy Atherton be present to take notes at all
                    of these meetings. Even when the Egyptian Ambassador came in to talk to
                    Kissinger, I don't think there was a single occasion when I was able to get in
                    to be with Kissinger on such a meeting.</p>
                <p>The one time that I did go in for a meeting was, when the British Ambassador
                    called on Kissinger, and I suddenly got a summons with no warning on this, to be
                    prepared to come up and take notes at this meeting. I had no idea what it was
                    about, why I would be called in for the British Ambassador. I was waiting in the
                    anteroom when I suddenly got called in and Kissinger said, “take notes of
                    this”.</p>
                <p>There were several people in the room and it all had to do with China. I was
                    absolutely flabbergasted. I didn't know the names of any of the people, I didn't
                    know who was in the room, I didn't know who these Chinese were that they were
                    talking about. There was a very civilized conversation and here I was scribbling
                    away trying to keep track of them. Of course Henry wanted verbatim notes. I
                    don't know what the hell I would have done if I really had been the one that had
                    to produce a report on it, but fortunately there was somebody else in the room
                    whom I guess was the Chinese desk officer who said, “Don't worry, I know what
                    it's all about.” He said he was astonished at seeing me there.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Anyway, basically it was typical Kissinger. First he didn't know me even though
                    we met briefly in Vietnam when he had come out on a visit for LBJ back in the
                    earlier days. Maybe he didn't have total confidence in his own GLOP program. In
                    any case I never took notes on any meetings with Kissinger. There was always
                    someone more senior. And this wasn't only me, with most of the people in the
                    bureau, Kissinger wanted somebody who was much more senior to take hold of these
                    things.</p>
                <p>Anyway it was a very exciting time and Sadat of course addressed a Joint Session
                    of Congress, a very extraordinary thing. There was the dinner at the White
                    House, my wife and I were not invited to the dinner, but we did get invited to
                    after-dinner and danced right next to the Fords. Sadat and the Egyptians didn't
                    do any dancing, any public dancing, that was their choice.</p>
                <p>The return dinner at the Order of the Cincinnati mansion on Massachusetts Ave.,
                    was a very grand affair, very pleasant, very nice. I had written a toast, as I
                    had for the White House dinner, and it was all put on cards for President Ford.
                    I was sitting at a table with Walter Cronkite and one of the Kennedy sisters and
                    several other people but not up near the front. There was a big table in the
                    center with Ford and Sadat and Kissinger and various other people.</p>
                <p>It came time for the toast and Ford stood up with these cards in his hands and it
                    was virtually the same toast that I had written, very little changes. So
                    naturally I thought it was a good toast. President Ford got to the end of the
                    toast and put the cards down and said, “Now let us all raise our glasses to the
                    friendship of the people of the United States and the people of Israel.”</p>
                <p>I thought Kissinger was going to fall under the table, everybody at the table
                    gasped, Cronkite said, “Did I hear what I heard?” Nobody could believe what had
                    been said and poor President Ford said, “I mean, I mean the people of Isr of
                    Egypt.” It was just awful. I guess it was just that people were so used to
                    anything to do with the Middle East—”it's the United States and Israel, it's the
                    United States and Israel” So that gaffe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ford was Renowned for these gaffes. What was your
                        impression during this period of Sadat? I mean what were you getting? Here
                        he was the new boy on the block when he first came in, when Nasser
                        died.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: 1970 I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was considered quite a lightweight. But obviously we
                        already had at least a, not a disastrous, war in '73. What was the feeling
                        about his abilities and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I ended up as a great admirer of Sadat. I think most people who dealt
                    with him did, I mean I was not the only one, most of the so-called Arabists
                    starting with Hermann Eilts, all thought he was an extraordinary man. He almost
                    from the beginning understood the importance of creating a favorable impression
                    with the American public and the American Congress. The result was that he gave
                    interviews, live interviews in some cases, but interviews to large numbers of
                    American reporters including some of the fancy media leaders who came out.</p>
                <p>He also devoted great attention to congressional visitors. Over the course of the
                    time that I was there, he received over 400 American congressmen and senators,
                    an extraordinary number. He never turned a single one down. It made for quite a
                    burden of course on the embassy to try to take care of all these people. But he
                    was just a wonderful spokesman for Egypt. He came across on American television
                    just beautifully. I think most people reacted to him very, sympathetically.</p>
                <p>His phraseology, his English was fairly good. One problem with his English was
                    that he spoke better than he understood, which is sort of the reverse of a lot
                    of people. So he sometimes didn't quite get what was said to him but his
                    speaking was excellent. He just charmed the pants off of virtually everybody who
                    came to see him.</p>
                <p>His visit to this country was played to the hilt. I think he had a major impact
                    especially with the Congress. The idea that Egypt and Israel should be on a par
                    in terms of financial assistance or economic assistance, a few years before that
                    would have been unthinkable. But he turned it around virtually singlehandedly
                    with his skill in dealing with people. I saw him numerous times off and on; I
                    would often be the one who would have to take congressional people around to see
                    him.</p>
                <p>I can remember many times sitting where he liked to receive people down at his
                    relatively modest house at what they called the Barrage, which was a small dam
                    on the Nile River in the Delta. He would receive them there and talk to them.
                    Or, even better, he liked to receive them in Isma'iliya, at his house on the
                    Suez Canal. You could see the ships passing by on the Canal. He would talk to
                    visiting delegations about what had happened during the crossing of the Canal in
                    the 1973 War. He always referred to it as 'the Crossing' or 'the October
                    Crossing'. There was even an Egyptian magazine called “October” to celebrate the
                    October crossing of the Canal.</p>
                <p>He was very proud of that because the Israelis assumed it would be impossible for
                    the Egyptians to cross the Canal. In fact they had, and they surprised the
                    Israelis in the '73 war in a rather astonishing fashion. They'd caught them
                    asleep because it was Yom Kippur. Anyway, it was very dramatic to have him down
                    there at Isma'iliya sitting under the palm trees, with ships going by on the
                    Canal while he explained to his visitors what had gone on.</p>
                <p>There were lots and lots of good visits that he had. He really went out of his
                    way to receive even the most minor congressmen. Without exception, they all came
                    away very well impressed.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling, particularly on the time when you
                        were on the desk, we'll pick up the Cairo bit a little later, about his
                        control of the political situation within Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Certainly in the beginning he had very firm control over what was
                    happening. Over the course of his period as President, gradually there were
                    democratic institutions that were brought forward, there was less direct control
                    over what was going on. There was often political opposition to what he was
                    trying to do from various sources, some left-wing people who felt that he was
                    betraying the legacy of Nasser, that was a frequent theme.</p>
                <p>There were even back then the beginnings of the fundamentalist views that he was
                    too liberal, in the sense of not following the strict principals of the Koran.
                    Although he himself was a devout Muslim, and said his prayers five times a day,
                    and had the famous mark on his forehead from touching his head to the ground.
                    But there was some political opposition, especially in the earlier years. It
                    didn't amount to very much. Members of The Peoples Assembly would speak out
                    against him and there were various clerics who preached against him.</p>
                <p>Over the years there became increasing criticism over his lifestyle, a lot of
                    feeling that he lived a little too high on the hog. Of course there were a lot
                    of palaces that were left over from the days when they had a royal family. He
                    used a number of those palaces around Cairo and Alexandria and there was
                    criticism of that.</p>
                <p>There was also criticism of Madame Sadat, that she was far too westernized, that
                    she was part English parentage. She was a very charming lady and had a lot of
                    style. She also became very popular especially with women in this country and
                    other places abroad. But there was a lot of feeling especially among the more
                    fundamentalist people that she was not playing the role of the traditional
                    Muslim wife, that she was doing a lot of things that were of doubtful virtue for
                    a good Muslim wife.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Heavily into birth control, family planning</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That came later, she became quite a spokeswoman for birth control and
                    for women's rights. There were a lot of changes in the domestic laws on the
                    rights of women in Egypt. This brought criticism of her and to some extent of
                    Sadat. In terms of the impression they both made on the American public, I think
                    they did an absolutely marvelous job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Washington, did you feel the lash of the
                        Israeli lobby at all? I mean here you were, I mean there must have been
                        concern on the part of the Israelis and their strong supporters here in the
                        United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There certainly was, but on the other hand, I had the impression there
                    was a lot of feeling on the part of the American Jews that this was perhaps an
                    opportunity to bring about some settlement in the Middle East. I think many
                    people agreed with the old dictum that in terms of peace in the Middle East,
                    there can be no war without Egypt, there can be no peace without Syria. So there
                    was a strong belief on the part of many American Jews in the Zionist and the
                    Israeli lobby in this country that if they could get the Egyptians to adopt a
                    more peaceful attitude towards Israel, this was a major part of the game in
                    trying to protect Israel's security.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of opposition to any sort of military assistance to Egypt, and I
                    think this is one reason why Kissinger was so concerned about encouraging any
                    Egyptian ambitions to try to get American assistance. In fact, any real American
                    military assistance didn't start to flow until after we succeeded in getting the
                    peace treaty between the two countries. There was the beginning of assistance
                    before that but it was very carefully measured and I think the constant effort
                    that we, and I think especially Kissinger, had to make sure that this never
                    exceeded what the Israeli lobby and the Israeli government were willing to go
                    along with. Of course they were especially concerned about any sort of offensive
                    weapons that could be brought to bear against Israel.</p>
                <p>The lobby itself of course was very powerful. I think the lobby had a difficult
                    time trying to adapt its methods of operating to the new idea of a charismatic
                    Arab leader, somebody who was appealing to the American public.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not at all like Nasser. I wasn't involved at the time but from all
                    accounts he was not somebody that the American people fell in love with.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Exactly. Whereas this fellow, Sadat, was a whole new ball game. He was
                    very clever. Sadat tried to encourage a number of prominent American Jewish
                    people to see things differently in Egypt.</p>
                <p>Sadat also, eventually made a number of different steps in such things as the
                    boycott in trying to appease American Jewish feelings about what was
                    happening.</p>

                        Cairo, where you were from '76 to '80. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes. I had a couple more trips to the area. I helped escort one big
                    congressional delegation that went to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Greece and Iran.
                    That included Tom Foley who was then, I think, the second ranking man on the
                    Agricultural Committee. It included wives. That was a very interesting trip
                    because it included a Senator from New Hampshire and another Senator, neither of
                    whom are in the Congress anymore, and in addition to Foley, it had some other
                    very bright congressmen and their wives.</p>
                <p>It was interesting to see how they reacted to the different places that we went.
                    It was my first experience of seeing Sadat with congressmen there in his own
                    country and he did a very good job indeed.</p>
                <p>I was also impressed with the Israelis. I had been to Israel on that one earlier
                    visit and in both cases they knew exactly who I was, what my background was,
                    they had a complete bio of me. Our program in Israel was over booked, I mean
                    every single minute was taken care of. They took us all over the place and they
                    followed a concerted careful propaganda line of what they wanted us to see, what
                    they wanted us to understand from it. All sorts of details that showed very
                    careful forethought, very careful planning, and a lot of experience in dealing
                    with American visitors whom they wanted to impress. It was quite interesting. In
                    Tehran we had a session with the Shah, and we saw a lot of things there.</p>
                <p>But anyway, then in April of 1976 Frank Maestrone, who had been the DCM in Cairo
                    under Hermann, was named Ambassador to Kuwait. A bit to my surprise, Hermann
                    said he would like to have me as DCM. I think this probably surprised a lot of
                    people because I didn't have any Middle East experience. But nevertheless, I
                    thought it was great and was very excited about going.</p>
                <p>So I got there, in April or May of 1976. I first went out without the family, and
                    they came along later in the summer after school was out. Thinking back on those
                    first days in Cairo, the Embassy did some renovation on the house that I was to
                    live in, which was the one that Frank Maestrone had been in, and so I lived in
                    the Embassy compound when I first got there, in an apartment. So, not having my
                    family there, I quickly fell into the bad habit of spending many, many hours
                    there in the embassy. But it was a fascinating place.</p>
                <p>It turned out that Hermann was primarily interested in having me act in the role
                    of keeping track of what was going on in the embassy, especially to ride herd on
                    the administrative side of things, which was a very difficult chore. We had a
                    succession of Administrative Counselors over the 4 1/2 years that I was there,
                    of various abilities. But the continuing problems of trying to run that embassy
                    were considerable, especially as it grew in size—with all the problems of
                    shortages of housing, an enormous AID mission that came in there, all sorts of
                    problems with customs, telephone service, water shortages, appliances, virtually
                    everything you could think of on the administrative side of things. Security was
                    a major issue.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern as this thing grew, I mean we have while
                        you were there, the results of the growth of both our mission but also our
                        commercial presence and all blew up in Iran. I mean it still reverberates
                        today. I mean putting just too many Americans into a foreign culture
                        particularly one like the Iranian culture, what about in Egypt? Was this a
                        concern of the Ambassador's and of yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FM;It was a major concern. Hermann was very worried about it, I think he had a
                    visceral feeling about excess staff. He was a very conscientious public servant
                    among other things, he felt that it was a waste of money and a waste of
                    everybody's time to have too many people on the scene. They just got in each
                    others way and it was not a good idea to do it. It was wasteful and something he
                    didn't agree with. He fought every single increase in staff, tooth and nail, but
                    he got eventually beaten down.</p>
                <p>Especially on the AID side, they kept saying, we've got to have the people here.
                    If we don't there are going to be scandals, the Congress is going to be on our
                    backs because we don't have enough people to keep an eye on what's going on. And
                    so the place just grew like topsy. But he would bitterly complain to virtually
                    anybody who would listen, he complained in letters and memos and so forth.</p>
                <p>When he finally retired, he wrote a famous piece about the terrible problems he
                    had with too much staff. It became a rather controversial piece because I think
                    he said a bit more than he really intended to.</p>
                <p>It was very, very difficult to try to keep this back. One aspect of it was that
                    the Egyptian people as a whole were very welcoming to Americans. They were so
                    happy that after 7 years of no relations at all, that here the United States had
                    come in there and we were welcomed with open arms. I remember the first time
                    that I was in Egypt, walking back from the embassy to the hotel and an Egyptian
                    man, obviously lower class, came towards me as I was walking along the road that
                    runs along the side of the Nile. This fellow came towards me and I could see him
                    staring at me intently, as he came up to me he stopped and said, “Are you
                    American?” I said, “yes I am.” He said, “Welcome, welcome.” He put his arm out
                    around me.</p>
                <p>This was the kind of feeling that you had, that everybody was very happy to see
                    the Americans there. So there was not the kind of pressure that you had that you
                    didn't want people there.</p>
                <p>The one thing that did slow us down was the availability of housing, which was
                    very hard to come by. Electricity was very erratic and very poor. Water was
                    unsafe to drink, if you had any water. Often the apartment elevators would break
                    down.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Telephone service was really terrible, totally unreliable, you could not call the
                    airport, it was not possible to call the airport. So if you had a delegation
                    coming in and the planes were delayed or something, it was hopeless. In the
                    beginning it didn't take all that long to get to the airport but later on it
                    could take you as much as two hours to get out to the airport, so it was a real
                    disadvantage not being able to maintain contact with it. Eventually we found out
                    that the Office of the Presidency, Sadat's Chief of Staff, did have a special
                    line that ran out there, so if it really was important we were able occasionally
                    to make use of their telephone line to get a message to or from the airport. For
                    a long time it was very hard.</p>
                <p>Finally what happened was, through our AID program we were able, through a
                    satellite, to call from downtown Cairo to the airport on the satellite. To go up
                    into outer space and back down again, a matter of 15 miles out to the airport.
                    But there were a lot of problems of that nature that gave us a good way to try
                    to hold off the hordes of people from various agencies that wanted to get out
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Q: What was your impression of the AID program? It's such
                        a huge thing but did you have the feeling, you'd seen what happened in
                        Vietnam, were we doing the same thing? In a way getting into
                        everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I don't think we were doing it to the extent that we did in Vietnam.
                    Major efforts were made to try to keep our program tailored to the real needs of
                    the country and not get into big demonstration projects or building museums or
                    great monuments to American AID. But the Egyptian needs were very great indeed.
                    A lot of our AID turned out to have to be in PL 480 wheat, providing food for
                    the country. We made a lot of efforts in urban renewal and trying to build
                    housing and sewage, telephones, electricity, a lot of infrastructure type
                    efforts. Eventually these were fairly successful.</p>
                <p>I think Egypt's major problem, and I think it still is despite considerable
                    effort, is population growth. I mean it's just growing out of sight and the
                    numbers of people there just boggles the mind. There was some resistance to
                    population control, some of it on religious grounds—some of the Muslims
                    disapproved of it, some of the coptic Christians also had problems with it. Just
                    the sheer difficulty of persuading people that it was no longer necessary to
                    produce 10 children in order to have 5 that survived who could continue to work
                    the farm. It took a long time to get this message across. I think it's improved
                    to a substantial extent but it still is higher than it ought to be. In those
                    years population growth was just destroying any efforts to try to raise the
                    standard of living.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>One of the major problems, and I'm afraid this was to some extent Sadat's fault
                    because he kind of encouraged it, was that the Egyptian people came to believe,
                    that with peace was going to come an improvement in their daily life. Sadat
                    encouraged this, he would give impromptu statements or he would give speeches
                    which suggested that the reason he had made a certain concession to the Israelis
                    was that this was going to bring peace and when peace came, life would be better
                    for everybody.</p>
                <p>The people took this to mean not simply that their sons would not be going off to
                    war and be killed in battle, but it also meant that bread would be more abundant
                    and food would be better and housing would be more available and life would
                    improve. Of course those things didn't happen. So I think there was a great deal
                    of disillusionment that gradually set in. I think that that is one of the root
                    causes of the problems that Egypt is facing today.</p>
                <p>It's not simply fundamentalism. I think the fundamentalists efforts, and the
                    increased interest in fundamentalism in Islamic rule, has come about through
                    frustration on the part of a lot of the people that they don't see any other way
                    to improve life. Therefore they're returning to whatever was there before the
                    Koran. They were encouraged by the Islamic students and clerics that if they
                    could just get unified and form an Islamic state, that then they would be able
                    to cut back on corruption, and do away with the fat cats who were living high on
                    the hog, that then there'd be more for everybody. I think that the
                    fundamentalists profited from the disillusionment of the people that life, in
                    fact, did not get better.</p>
                <p>And of course, one of the inevitable results I think of a large AID program is
                    that some of the money gets filtered off to places where it shouldn't go. So you
                    saw a lot more Mercedes in the streets and a lot of television sets. I think
                    most of our people in our AID program were capable people. Don Brown was the AID
                    Director throughout the time that I was there, the brother of Dean Brown in the
                    State Department side of the foreign service. He tried very hard to make the AID
                    program something sensible, that made a difference.</p>
                <p>But I think also one of the problems, as with AID all over the world, was the
                    tremendous amount of congressional interference with the heavy requirements that
                    are placed on AID to justify everything they do, and the budget cycle that is
                    required for the AID programs. It's just extraordinary that no sooner are they
                    finished working up their budget for this year, than they're working on the one
                    for the next. In the end it's just a continual effort to keep up with
                    congressional requirements. It's not just large sums of money but every little
                    project has to have umpteen justifications for what they're doing. It wastes an
                    awful lot of people.</p>

                        Cairo? Did they have good contacts, were they out and around?I mean, how did
                        they work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think they were very good in my day. They did get around a lot, I
                    think they kept plugged in to the different parties, the different religious
                    groups. I think they made a real effort, they did a good job. I think their
                    reporting out of Cairo was outstanding. We had some very good people there that
                    turned out very good work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't find CIA and State were at odds, you didn't
                        have the feeling that this was, I won't say a rogue operation, but it was
                        going its own way or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No. I think that it was partly Hermann Eilts that kept on top of
                    things. Nobody dared get out of line on something like that. He insisted on
                    seeing all the traffic that went back and forth. I think I saw virtually all of
                    it too.</p>
                <p>At one point we had some problems with our attach�s' office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the military attach�s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The military attach�s. They tended to go off in sort of different
                    directions and they were specially suspicious of people in other agencies. We
                    had a bit of a problem there from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard stories that, maybe not particularly at this
                        time but at other times maybe earlier on or something, that the American
                        military from time to time, I mean all of a sudden they would discover that
                        there was sort of almost a joint exercise going on or Generals were coming
                        out that you didn't kind of know about. Things were happening.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That didn't happen while Hermann was there, he kept a very close eye on
                    anything that happened. And also while Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State,
                    he kept a close eye on the Washington end of things. I knew very well from my
                    experience being on the desk that no senior military people went out there
                    without permission. Kissinger got an NSC order out that there would be no high
                    level visits to Cairo without State Department approval. We had a pretty good
                    lock on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Constant vigilance was the name of the game. It was during
                        the period that you were in Cairo that Sadat made his famous trip to Israel.
                        How did that impact on you? In the first place were you kind of getting
                        ready for it? How did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: The Sadat announcement that he would go to the Knesset, if that would
                    bring about peace, came completely out of the blue as far as we were
                    concerned.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>To go back, there had been efforts, there had been a sustained effort by
                    Kissinger through the various shuttle diplomacy trips that he had made, to bring
                    about disengagement in the Sinai and also on the Golan Heights. There had been
                    various stages of Israeli withdrawal. By the time that Sadat made his speech not
                    too much had been happening for a while and it looked as though a stalemate had
                    developed.</p>
                <p>The question was, how were you going to get things off dead center and get them
                    to move ahead. Of course by then Kissinger was no longer in office. Secretary
                    Vance was Secretary of State and Carter was President.</p>
                <p>Even though there were some efforts to move ahead on the peace front, not very
                    much had happened at all. The Israelis were still sitting in the passes in the
                    Sinai, we did have the Sinai field mission out there, a very interesting group
                    of people.</p>
                <p>Our American Sinai field mission was out in the Sinai monitoring the
                    disengagement agreement. A lot of them had their families in Cairo which added
                    to our problems of housing and so forth. They could have their families either
                    in Cairo or in Israel, as they wished.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I think what happened was that Sadat got impatient with the lack of
                    anything happening and I think he was a great believer that if there was no sign
                    of movement forward in the peace process, that things would turn around the
                    other way and you'd head back towards war. And so he made this speech in the
                    Peoples Assembly, saying that it was time to head for peace and that if
                    necessary, he would go to the Knesset and speak to the Israeli people.</p>
                <p>This happened just as a large congressional delegation headed by Majority Leader
                    Wright [from Texas], who later became the Speaker, arrived with their wives in
                    Cairo and I was the Control Officer, as I usually was on the big delegations. So
                    there was great excitement over this statement by Sadat, the press was very
                    interested. But people were not too sure just exactly what he meant—whether he
                    was really serious or whether this was sort of like saying, I'd give my right
                    arm for a new car or something.</p>
                <p>So the program was that the Wright delegation was to go down to the Barrage—this
                    little dam on the Nile where the former British engineer had had a nice little
                    house. It was nothing elaborate but Sadat liked to be down there and he liked to
                    receive visitors there. It was only about an hour from Cairo, north on the
                    Nile.</p>
                <p>So we all went down there, several busloads. I think there was something like 20
                    congressmen plus their wives, plus staffs, so it was big, there were something
                    over 50 people in all. A full air force plane load of them. So we all went down
                    there, and my wife went along because of the congressional wives.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>We all sat around this big table at the Barrage and Majority Leader Wright said,
                    “Mr. President, we've heard that you made the statement yesterday in the Peoples
                    Assembly about going to the Knesset, speaking in Israel. Would you explain to us
                    what you mean by this. How serious is this?”</p>
                <p>And Sadat said, “Well, I will tell you. But first we must have some
                    refreshments.” So waiters came in with juices to pass around and he sat back and
                    lit his pipe. When they were all through with that, then he said, “Yes I will go
                    to the Knesset—as soon as I am invited I will go. I'm going to speak to the
                    Israeli people.”</p>
                <p>This was really dramatic, as this was the first time that it was clear that he
                    really meant it, that it was not just a figure of speech.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't the usual Arab hyperbole.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It wasn't just a figure of speech, it was something serious. So there
                    was great excitement, Lots of questions, a very amicable session, very very
                    dramatic. Then what usually happened was that Sadat would go out in the garden
                    and the guests would come out and they could talk individually to him in the
                    garden outside. These sessions were always live with the press there, CBS and
                    NBC and so forth.</p>
                <p>So he got up to go, and my wife and I were standing over near the entrance, and
                    as he started out the press photographers and the TV guys got right between us.
                    So Sadat was here and the press was here and we were right behind them. The NBC
                    guy said, “President Sadat, won't you be afraid going to Israel? Something could
                    happen to you.”</p>
                <p>The most astonishing thing happened. Sadat was facing directly at us, and his
                    eyes just glared and he said, “Never! Allah will protect me. 'I am going on a
                    sacred mission.' Allah will protect me!” It was just startling to see him and he
                    clearly believed it. He went out and people went on out to talk to him.</p>
                <p>The delegation stayed on for a day or two in Cairo and then flew in their plane
                    up to Aswan and Luxor, as part of their visit, and then they were to go on to
                    Israel. My wife and I flew with them up to Luxor and Aswan.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>In the meantime plans moved ahead very quickly and Sadat was to leave that day to
                    go to Israel to speak to the Knesset. Wright said, “Well, you come with us. You
                    and Nancy should come with us to Israel so you can hear this.” I thought that
                    would be really fantastic but then I thought, I just wonder how this would look
                    with the DCM of the American Embassy in Cairo arriving with this group in
                    Israel. I knew for sure I'd better check with Hermann, so I called him via
                    satellite in Cairo. He agreed that it would probably be a mistake to do that, so
                    we didn't go.The Wright delegation went on and they were there when Sadat made
                    his speech to the Knesset. It was a very dramatic event. That really did push
                    things off of dead center and moved things forward in the peace process. Things
                    moved along pretty well then. Among other things it galvanized the Carter
                    administration and got them really going hard on it.</p>
                <p>That was really the beginning of that phase of the peace process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume the Camp David business, you were basically
                        minding the store.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That was interesting because it went on for I think 13 days. There was
                    virtually no news, if you remember there was a complete news blackout on what
                    was happening. That also included any kind of messages to foreign service posts
                    or the embassy in Cairo as to what was happening. So Sadat was there, Hermann of
                    course went back and was at Camp David. That left me in charge of the embassy,
                    trying to figure out what was going on. It also left Hosni Mubarak, the Vice
                    President, also wondering what was going on.</p>
                <p>He and I got to know each other quite well in this period because we were trying
                    to figure out what was going on. He had me over in the course of that period,
                    something like 6 or 7 times to his little house to try to learn what was
                    happening. We would exchange thoughts as to how things were going and talk about
                    other things too. But it gave me a chance to get to see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Mubarak. Because he was sort
                        of a cipher at that point, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was not well known, and he was clearly a military man. He
                    occasionally would receive congressional delegations himself. He worked very
                    hard on his own English because at the beginning I don't think he had any
                    English. I think perhaps now his English is better than Sadat's was.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>There was never any question of his loyalty to Sadat, he was totally loyal to
                    him. He had been an air force general before and actually had received training
                    in the Soviet Union. As happened with many of the Egyptian officers who had gone
                    over to the Soviet Union, it did not result in his becoming pro-Soviet. Quite
                    the contrary, they came back unhappy with the Soviets because the their
                    treatment they received there. I gather the Soviets, tended to look down on them
                    and treat them as kind of subhuman species. So they were not favorably impressed
                    by the Soviets.</p>
                <p>He was very pro-American, but he tended to be a lot blunter than Sadat was. He
                    was particularly strong in saying that Egypt ought to get more military
                    assistance. He was much more forceful in trying to press for that. He was a very
                    straightforward type of fellow, you didn't get the feeling that this was
                    somebody you had to dance around with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about our knowledge of the Egyptian
                        military because we must have wanted to look at, I mean the military is a
                        major factor. Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak all came out of the military. In a
                        country such as Egypt you have to be concerned about how affected or
                        disaffected the military is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: When we were there, there was no sign of any kind of disaffection
                    within the military. I think it came as a total surprise to everybody when Sadat
                    was assassinated by members of one of the more elite units in the military. I
                    never heard any inklings that there was disaffection in the military. I think
                    that as with many countries, it's hard to get a handle on what is going on in
                    the lower ranks. Among other things, certainly in the beginning, you couldn't
                    just go out and visit a military unit.</p>
                <p>To visit an Egyptian military unit, you had to get permission first. And in the
                    earlier days, you had to get permission to even contact anybody in the Egyptian
                    military, to invite them to a reception or a party, that had to be run through
                    the Egyptian protocol office, the military office. The access that our military
                    attach�s had to Egyptian military was distinctly limited.</p>
                <p>In terms of trying to learn about the Egyptian military, obviously there was a
                    lot of interest on our part in the Soviet weaponry that they had. As time went
                    on, the Egyptians became very cooperative and very helpful. Mubarak was
                    especially helpful, personally, in working out some arrangements for us to
                    receive not only samples of Egyptian-acquired Soviet equipment, but I think we
                    ended up even with an entire squadron of a large number of Russian MIGS that
                    were then used in our combat training in this country so that our flyers could
                    really see what the Soviet equipment was like. But there was a lot of effort put
                    into that. The Egyptians ended up being very cooperative, very helpful.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>While I think the senior officers in our military establishment were anxious to
                    establish a good working relationship with the Egyptians, there were some,
                    especially in the military sales side of it, who were looking for ways to make
                    money and to strike hard bargains. Some of them, it seemed to me, were some of
                    the worst examples of the merchants of death that you can run into.</p>
                <p>I had an experience with one of them who came out there to acquire Soviet
                    military equipment, to be balanced against the prices for American military
                    equipment we were going to provide to the Egyptians. At one point Mubarak said,
                    “No, we don't want any payment for this equipment,”—the Soviet stuff that they
                    had—”you can have that, it's a gesture from Egypt. We're not interested in
                    trying to haggle over the price you pay for it. It's just a gesture of
                    friendship from us.”</p>
                <p>Very clearly what he had in mind was that we would be similarly forthcoming on
                    our side when it came to discussing prices for American equipment. Well, our
                    side of the bargain didn't carry through. I think it was kind of a rude
                    awakening to Mubarak and to the Egyptian military that we were very firm in our
                    pricing, and not helpful at all in trying to meet the Egyptian concerns over
                    military cost. This occurred considerably later in the period that I was there
                    and I think it got even worse later on as significant amounts of American
                    military equipment went over there and repayment schedules were set-up that
                    ended up costing the Egyptians significant amounts of money. I think, at least
                    in that instance, we treated the Egyptians unfairly, because they in effect,
                    gave us Soviet military equipment which was priceless to us because some of it
                    we never had seen before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the reporting from Israel? What was the
                        reaction of the officers in concern with the embassy? I mean, you had the
                        Likud government in, very tough, Begin was the Prime Minister, very
                        aggressive government as far as what they were doing. We had an Ambassador,
                        Sam Lewis, who is considered by many Arabists to be too pro-Israeli. And
                        again I'm talking to you because you weren't one of the 'Club,' you might
                        say and watching this. What were you seeing the reaction from, you might say
                        the Arabist group, who were there too, when they would get copies from
                        Israel on all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: You sort of pointed the direction of thinking there. It certainly is
                    true that we all felt that the Israeli government was not doing what it could to
                    try to further the peace process, and that our embassy in Israel was not being
                    very forceful in trying to push the Israelis in the right direction. I also
                    share the view that Sam Lewis ended up being very much pro-Israel, I think more
                    than he certainly should have been. I also question his having accepted
                    positions with Israeli institutions after he left being Ambassador. I think
                    there are some ethical questions there.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I think that Begin was a man who with his background found it very difficult to
                    give up anything to the Arabs. He was such a strong Zionist, such a believer in
                    Israel and in the right of Israel to all of the land of Israel, as he described
                    it. I don't know about Begin, but some of the people around him, including Arik
                    Sharon have said the land of Israel extended well beyond just the West Bank and
                    Gaza and the Golan Heights, well into Arab territories. Begin found it extremely
                    difficult to give anything up of that nature. Very quickly after the peace
                    treaty was signed, and the Israelis had to withdraw from the Sinai, this
                    reluctance became very clear in the early autonomy talks, that were supposed to
                    lead to the kinds of agreements that are going on right now between the PLO and
                    Israel. That was supposed to have continued right on, following on the peace
                    treaty with Egypt.</p>
                <p>It didn't happen because, I believe, Begin really had not intended to carry
                    through on the Palestinian side of the bargain. And if you recall, the
                    Egyptians, and Sadat especially, were very concerned that it not appear that he
                    was signing a separate peace with Israeli and casting the Palestinians to the
                    side and not getting anything for them. So that Palestinian autonomy as part of
                    the Camp David agreements was not simply, in Sadat's view, or in the Egyptians'
                    view, a fig leaf to cover their peace treaty with Israel but was something that
                    they were very serious about and that they thought would eventually lead to
                    Palestinian autonomy.</p>
                <p>I went to the first meeting of the autonomy talks in Beersheba in Israel. I flew
                    over on Secretary Vance's plane, Vance came to Cairo. This was after Hermann
                    Eilts had left and before Roy Atherton got there so I was the Charg� ad interim.
                    So we went to the very first meeting in Beersheba with Begin and Sadat and the
                    rest of them. This was supposed to be the lead into the on-going autonomy talks.
                    It consisted basically of set speeches, and some pleasantries all the way
                    around. Then I flew back to Cairo on Sadat's airplane because I had no other way
                    to get back, which was an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>But the autonomy talks quickly floundered; there were several other meetings that
                    were held with lower level delegations in Alexandria and in Israel but they
                    didn't lead anywhere and eventually they were broken off. Nothing further
                    happened on that front until we finally began to get some movement now with the
                    PLO and Israel.</p>
                <p>But I think that Begin basically didn't want to have to face up to the fact that
                    the West Bank especially, but also Gaza, were going to have to be up for
                    negotiation. I think also that he reneged on his commitments about settlements
                    in the occupied territories. It was clear that he had agreed that there were not
                    to be any further settlements but he continued to push them. I think that helped
                    to destroy whatever confidence the Egyptians had in his word. There was a great
                    sense of euphoria when the peace treaty was finally signed, but that quickly
                    dissipated when it turned out that they were not able to reach agreement on
                    autonomy for the Palestinians.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>There was a further disagreement on the issue of the border at the top of the
                    Gulf of Aqaba, in the area called Taba, where the Israelis redrew the map so
                    that some fancy resort hotels in which Ariel Sharon had heavily invested could
                    be considered on the Israeli side of the border. Eventually after long, long
                    talks, that went on for several years, the Israelis finally succumbed to agree
                    that the maps they had drawn were wrong and that the original boundaries were
                    the correct ones. This again helped destroy any feelings that the Egyptians
                    might have had for whether the Israelis were going to live up to their side of
                    the bargain or not.</p>
                <p>So it was very sad to think there was a possibility that things could have been
                    carried on once you had that momentum going towards the peace treaty. But the
                    autonomy talks didn't lead anyplace and then you had Sadat's assassination,
                    which occurred after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I left in July 1980. He was assassinated the following October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning there were some other things we ought
                        to discuss.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: One thing that I remember very clearly, it was during the same period,
                    the time of the signing of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. What led
                    up to that was that after Camp David Carter began a sort of mini-shuttle to
                    Israel and Egypt to bring about the final agreement between the two countries.
                    He had been to Egypt and then he went on to Israel and then he came back to
                    Egypt to try to firm this up.</p>
                <p>His visit to the area was one on which we had a total of 72 hours advance notice
                    for a Presidential Visit to a country like Egypt. It was something! We had 36
                    hours advance notice of the arrival of the advance team. So it was a very busy
                    time indeed. I had previous experiences with presidential advance teams when
                    Nixon came to Mexico. These Carter people were a lot more pleasant to deal with
                    than the Nixon team. But it still was extremely difficult to try to set up.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians turned out to be quite efficient when they really wanted to put
                    their minds to it. They ran an excellent program. One of the first things that
                    happened was, when the advance team got there, the Egyptians said—and I had
                    already heard this from the Egyptians— they would like Carter to make a trip by
                    rail to Alexandria, just as Nixon had done when he came on a visit in the Summer
                    of '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was about that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, it was '74.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon having real trouble with Watergate went running off
                        to Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It was just before I came on the desk. Anyway, they wanted Carter to do
                    the same thing. The Carter advance team said, that's exactly the reason we don't
                    want to do it. We don't want to do the same thing that Nixon did. Well, I said,
                    you're going to have trouble persuading the Egyptians that that's not going to
                    happen. And of course the Egyptians insisted because that's what Sadat wanted.
                    Sadat got it, that's what happened.</p>
                <p>So it was just a whirlwind visit. It some ways it's better to have that short a
                    notice because there's not a hell of a lot you can do. It was really something.
                    We did have the train trip to Alexandria. My wife and daughter went along on it
                    because the Carters were there and Amy of course was along. We all went up to
                    Alexandria for an overnight stay. It was all very exciting. My daughter, who was
                    only 20 ended up on a date with Hamilton Jordan one evening there.</p>
                <p>We all stayed over in the Palestine Hotel down at one end of Alexandria.
                    President Carter was lodged in the Ras al-Jin Palace at the other end. I
                    remember getting there very early in the morning and was walking around the
                    Palace and suddenly in an inner courtyard, there was President Carter. He just
                    appeared; he had some paper he was studying carefully and he stopped at a table
                    in the middle of the room and worked on the paper. He suddenly looked up and saw
                    I was the only other one in the room. I couldn't believe it but I guess there
                    must have been a security guy nearby. Anyway, he smiled and said, good morning,
                    and we shook hands.</p>
                <p>It was very exciting with the president there. The crowds along the way on the
                    railroad trip to Alexandria were just enormous. There were still some signs
                    about Nixon on the walls as we rode by. Carter got a kick out of that. Crowds
                    were wildly cheering with great excitement.The purpose of the trip was to try to
                    break down the last barriers to the peace treaty. Carter got some further
                    concessions from Sadat and then went on to Israel. I guess he got some further
                    ones from Begin but not enough to cross the last t and dot the last i on the
                    treaty. So he came back to Egypt and everybody was very glum.</p>
                <p>He came back to Egypt just to the airport and we were all out there in the VIP
                    lounge. Just Carter and Sadat and Vance and Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy,
                    worked in an upstairs room on the final details of this treaty. Finally, Carter
                    came out and announced that President Sadat had agreed to the final point that
                    Begin had insisted upon. Everyone clapped and cheered at this great news.</p>
                <p>Carter, really knew all the details of everything that was going on there. He was
                    the negotiator on this. I ended up feeling that Carter did a pretty wonderful
                    job as President, at least in the Middle East. The whole time that he was
                    President, I was in Cairo, so I ended up with a very different view than many
                    other people did about his presidency.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Then after the treaty had been signed, on the trip that I had mentioned earlier,
                    Vance came out to Cairo and we went on to Beersheba for the first autonomy
                    talks. En route there was a ceremonial visit to a town (EL ARISH) in the
                    Egyptian part of the Sinai up along the coast just before the Gaza Strip. There
                    was to be the turnover from the Israelis to the Egyptians on the site. Then we
                    went on from there to Beersheba. Again at this time I was the Charg� d'Affaires
                    between Hermann and Atherton.</p>
                <p>It was very difficult making the arrangements to go into this place in the Sinai
                    that the Israelis still had under their control, but they were moving out and
                    the Egyptians were moving in. So we didn't know what was there and what kind of
                    buildings we could use for the different meetings, etc. Trying to coordinate
                    with the Israelis and the Egyptians, and the embassy in Tel Aviv, and trying to
                    work out all the security arrangements, as well as the logistics was an absolute
                    nightmare. The roads at that point, from Egypt into the Israeli part of the
                    Sinai, were not very good but some of the transport had to be done by road. I
                    flew over in Vance's airplane when he got there.</p>
                <p>One of the really scary things was that we had received a report (we were always
                    getting intelligence reports on things that might happen, terrorist attacks and
                    so forth) that was particularly worrisome because it seemed to come from a
                    pretty good source. The gist was that one of the press photographers on either
                    the Egyptian side or the Israeli side, had been coopted by terrorists. His
                    camera had been equipped so that instead of taking a picture, it was actually a
                    gun and he could shoot through it.</p>
                <p>So we did everything we could to get this checked out and to make sure all the
                    different security people knew about it. Nevertheless when we got there, the
                    press briefing was held in what looked like a small warehouse. The press were
                    all sitting in rows down below with the principals and their staffs including
                    me, up there on this platform looking down at the press. And here they all were
                    with these cameras. It was a bit nerve-racking wondering if one of those
                    things...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no, no, don't take pictures!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: One of the sad things was that the Israelis destroyed eveything before
                    then left, and I think they're planning to do the same thing in Gaza in the
                    Golan Heights. I saw an Israeli TV program that claimed they were going to do
                    the same thing in the Golan Heights, that they were going to destroy whatever
                    they had there rather than turn anything over. This fellow in the Golan Heights
                    said he was going to cut down all his apple trees if he ever had to pull out.
                    That kind of thing is very sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a very sad thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It sets a bad precedent. Anyway I think that is probably about it on
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>The last year I was there was with Roy Atherton. He was a very different kind of
                    Ambassador than Hermann Eilts was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think a little bit more in a substantive sense than Hermann did. With
                    Hermann, as I said earlier, and it took me a while to learn this, he didn't seek
                    my views on policy, though he was grateful to receive them when I offered them.
                    But he primarily looked to me not as a substantive adviser so much as somebody
                    to run the nitty gritty of the embassy. Roy, I think partly because he was the
                    new man on the block, used me more in a substantive sense.</p>
                <p>Being a DCM is a very interesting job because among other things, even though
                    Hermann wanted me not as the substantive guy so much, when he wasn't there
                    obviously...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're in charge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It turned over. Even though he was a very active man, when he wasn't
                    there, and that happened I guess maybe about a quarter of the time, it meant
                    that I really did have to be both substantive and kind of executive thing.</p>
                <p>Hermann was an extraordinary Arabist and a very fine FSO. He worked very hard and
                    very efficiently. He spoke in perfectly paused sentences and could dictate the
                    same way. A demanding but compassionate boss!</p>
                <p>Hermann's hours and his work habits were also just a marvel. He was in the office
                    early every morning and stayed late into the evening. In the three years that we
                    overlapped there, I think he took leave only three days—once he was sick, and
                    once was Christmas and there was some other occasion when he was out. But
                    otherwise he was in the office every single day. He didn't ask you to be there,
                    but you know, if you weren't there he wondered where you were. Roy was very
                    different, and it ended up much easier to work with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I left Egypt and came back to Washington. I became Deputy Director of Management
                    Operations, which was a deputy assistant secretary level job. Our function there
                    was to be a kind of an enlarged staff to the Under Secretary for Management,
                    whatever he wanted us to do was what we did. We controlled personnel levels, not
                    the actual staffing of jobs but the numbers of jobs that there were abroad.</p>
                <p>We did a large number of different studies of what could be done to improve
                    management around the Department. We had a lot of odd jobs. Very soon after I
                    got there I ended up in a really peculiar highly classified job that took
                    increasing amounts of time and eventually became full time. It had to do with
                    emergency preparedness, sort of a doomsday thing, what do we do if we get hit
                    with a nuclear bomb. Especially after the Reagan administration came into
                    office, it turned into quite a big deal. It was an interagency thing and I think
                    it's still very highly classified. But it involved lots of interagency work and
                    a lot of highly secretive stuff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an unclassified interview. In many ways it's also
                        not as pertinent to the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: No, it's a little different today. I think some of the things we had to
                    do are still classified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to the other side, just your impression, the Reagan
                        administration came in in 1981. It was, as is so often the case, it was an
                        outsider group. Democrats had been in for a while, these were conservative
                        Republicans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>One of the great causes that the Reagan administration people came in with, first
                    place—these are State Department people, are sort of untrustworthy and you've
                    got to watch them. The other one was great signs all over, 'Prevent Waste, Fraud
                    and Mismanagement' which was almost, I still see these signs at the State
                    Department, as though the major thing you have to worry about at the State
                    Department is not 'serve your country abroad' but is 'you're a bunch of wasters,
                    frauders and mismanagers.' How did you find this where you were, this waste,
                    fraud and mismanagement, and the sort of initial impact of the Reagan
                    administration on the management side?</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that the Reagan gang really did come into office with an
                    antagonistic view towards Washington in general, and I think towards the State
                    Department in specific terms. It made it hard to work with them. It took a while
                    for the new team to get on board in the Department.</p>
                <p>Our own Under Secretary for Management had been Ben Read and he was succeeded by
                    Dick Kennedy, a horse of a very different color.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard of his temper, for example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yeah. A very severe temper. I've only seen it once but several other
                    people had also seen it. He looks like he's going to explode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this a put-on or is it a real temper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think it was a real temper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some people have tempers, they can turn it on and
                        off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: He was out-of-control the time I saw him and that's what I understand
                    of that. He also had a curious management style of criticizing subordinates in
                    front of everybody else at a staff meeting, which I find a very poor way to deal
                    with people. I don't think you accomplish anything. It embarrasses everybody
                    else and the person who's being criticized deeply resents it. I don't think it's
                    an effective way to do things. Anyway, he was a loyal Reaganite and somehow or
                    other has managed to stay on all these many years, maybe he's gone now, but for
                    a long time. He ended up in the Nuclear Regulatory area.</p>
                <p>Management operations was a very interesting office. Because of the change in the
                    administration there was a lot of effort to try to figure if there aren't ways
                    to do things better, cheaper, with fewer people and so forth. There was also the
                    whole question of the Ambassador's authority, that's one of the things that
                    management operations often gets into. The various relationships between
                    different agencies abroad, whether an agency has the right to assign as many
                    people as it wants to one of their offices in an embassy abroad, or whether the
                    State Department has some role in trying to control the number of people
                    assigned.</p>
                <p>This takes lots and lots of interagency argument back and forth. A lot of it
                    depends on whether the White house, specifically the NSC staff, is willing to
                    support the State Department in what ultimately is its primary role in trying to
                    be assertive about these things. Those things go up and down depending on who's
                    the Secretary of State and who's the NSC Adviser and how aggressive various
                    cabinet secretaries or underlings tend to be. That's the kind of thing that M/MO
                    gets into.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, there were stories about how Alexander

                <p>MATTHEWS: The vicar of foreign policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The vicar of foreign policy had the NSC staff opposed to
                        him almost from the beginning. Was this reflected in what you had to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: We had some difficulty in trying to get out a standard letter, that
                    dates back to the Kennedy years, that goes out to all Ambassadors over the
                    signature of the President, giving the Ambassador his authority over his
                    mission. We spent a lot of time arguing back and forth over that between the NSC
                    staff and objections from Bill Casey...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The head of CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: ...CIA, and other parts of the government as to what was permissible
                    and what wasn't. We did not get a great deal of support from the NSC on this. I
                    think that it tended to be due to Richard Allen who was the guy at the NSC at
                    the beginning. He didn't last too long, but neither did Haig of course.</p>
                <p>I think that was my clearest impression of how different things are, what a
                    disruption it is when you get a new political party in the White House and a new
                    President and all that. It really was different. And you're trying to
                    reestablish links that you used to have and now they're gone. You've got to find
                    out who it is that you call about this, that or the other kind of problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any change in the time you were there between
                        when Haig left and George Shultz came in, as far as control over things or
                        was it still a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think that Shultz had a much firmer grasp of what was going on and he
                    had a much higher standing, I think, with the White House. He was not somebody
                    who was going to be pushed around, not that Haig could be pushed around. But I
                    think there seemed to be a bit of a tendency not to take Haig seriously, there
                    was a little bit of the fly-by-night. And that famous incident when he said, not
                    to worry, I'm here in control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after Reagan was shot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: After Reagan was shot. Shultz was a different kind of person. I have a
                    high regard for George Shultz. I think he's a very good Secretary of State. I
                    think he made sure that the State Department was calling the tune, basically, in
                    what went on in foreign policy. Although he, and especially Casey, didn't
                    necessarily see eye-to-eye on a lot of things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weinberger was also another one too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>But on the management side, was this battle between staffing over overseas of the
                    various agencies, I take it this is a continual one and it's never</p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: It goes on and on and on. It's never permanently resolved. What
                    invariably happens is if there's a new decision that we're going to cut back on
                    numbers of personnel and so forth, or across the board decisions on things, the
                    other agencies always somehow find some way to get around the decision and it's
                    the State Department that takes the cuts. I increasingly got the feeling that
                    the State Department was primarily doing all the housekeeping for the other
                    agencies abroad. We're kind of getting rough shod by the other agencies on what
                    they wanted to do, and it's very hard to knock them back. They've got more or
                    less unlimited budgets and the State Department always plays by the rules and
                    has very tight budgets, so we have very difficult problems trying to cut
                    back.</p>
                <p>During the period that I was in M/MO and certainly since, we've seen a reduction
                    in the number of posts that we have abroad. Maybe some of that has been reversed
                    because of the breakup of the Soviet Union and the new embassies we've had to
                    put in there. But certainly the number of consulates we've had has gone way
                    down. I'm not sure that was such a wise idea.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Losing contacts, that's true.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: But there were so many issues that we had in M&amp;O. There were just
                    very interesting management issues. What happens when you put in more advanced
                    technological improvements. The fact that we have much better communications
                    now, the communications package is very rapid but it can't be left unprotected.
                    So you have to have a marine security detail to be there to make sure it's
                    adequately protected. That means you've got to have x-number more people in the
                    administrative side to manage the marine security detail, etc., etc.</p>
                <p>You can't get by on a small post with just a couple of communicators, you've got
                    to have much more around the clock. This endless kind of problem with what
                    modern technology is going to mean.</p>

                <p>MATTHEWS: Certainly in the Foreign Service, in the government, all this business
                    with new computers and so forth, that we're going to save personnel costs. I
                    don't believe it because you need more people to keep the computers running
                    properly and all that kind of thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then spent about a year with the Inspection
                        corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I spent my last year and a quarter in the Inspection corps., I did an
                    inspection of INR and then did some domestic inspections, the Office of
                    Protocol, which was very interesting with Lucky Roosevelt.</p>
                <p>It turned out that Lucky was doing a very good job in the visible parts of her
                    protocol job but not in terms of the nitty gritty of keeping track of people—who
                    was on the Diplomatic List, diplomatic privileges, who had tax-free cards, etc.
                    So we made a recommendation for a shift in some of the duties about the same
                    time that the Office of Foreign Missions was established to enforce reciprocity.
                    So that was an interesting issue. Lucky wasn't very happy with the way the
                    inspection came out but I think in the long run, it was a good thing.</p>
                <p>We did the Family Liaison Office, we inspected that. I did an inspection of the
                    Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs, which was a very interesting
                    inspection. I did some overseas inspections of the embassies in Madrid and
                    Lisbon with Fred Chapin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Inspection Corps. by this
                        period of time where you've shifted over to be what seems to be more, I
                        don't know, maybe I'm wrong you can correct me, more confrontational than it
                        had been prior to that, where it was more to go out to help.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think the period you're talking about probably occurred after I left
                    there. Bill Harrop was still the Inspector General, he has been replaced by
                    Sherman Funk. Bill was still the Inspector General and while there was more
                    emphasis on trying to look at some of the details of accounting procedures and
                    that kind of thing, I think it was still the old inspection system.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>I enjoyed the time in the Inspection Corps, I think we genuinely did try to help
                    the offices and the posts that we inspected and, in fact, we probably did. I
                    didn't find much resentment to what we were trying to do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Yes, I think we were. The question of thresholds, the whole idea of
                    cones, I don't think they're in the Foreign Service Act but they seem to
                    becoming more of an issue, I think the cones are probably a mistake but what can
                    be done about it. I think a major issue that came along is the whole question of
                    tandem couples.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about male and female married

                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: Not just the tandem couples but even if the spouse is not in the
                    Foreign Service, what in the world is she going to do? In many places overseas,
                    there just isn't anything useful that can be done for spouses. I got into that
                    to some extent in the inspection of the Family Liaison Office, which is very
                    much involved in trying to help that problem.</p>
                <p>I think this is going to be an increasing problem with the change in our society.
                    The spouse is no longer just somebody who stays home, raises the children, keeps
                    house and helps the husband to go along.</p>

                        family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: That's exactly right. I racked my own brains and talked to lots of
                    friends about what could be done about this, but I don't see any real way out of
                    it. A lot of these spouses are highly trained, very capable people and they go
                    abroad and there's nothing for them to do, nothing really useful for them to do.
                    Often they can find rather clerical type jobs in the embassies but not anything
                    very satisfying.</p>
                <p>A good friend of ours is a lawyer. She had a very good practice here in this
                    country. They went abroad and of course there was nothing to follow up on that.
                    Yet how at the same time do you raise children? It's a serious problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we end at this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: There are a couple of things I'd like to mention here.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>After I retired, and I realize that you're primarily interested in Foreign
                    Service careers, I did two things that are related to the Foreign Service. For a
                    little over a year I did Crisis Management Exercises, going to posts abroad and
                    putting on exercises to try to train people how to respond to simulated crises.
                    This program I think is very useful and we've had some good results. I observed
                    one in Santo Domingo and then led them in La Paz, Bogota, Nicosia, Vienna,
                    Athens and we were supposed to have done Rome but we weren't able to do that,
                    and then Madrid and Lisbon.</p>
                <p>I think these are very worthwhile programs which went on for a considerable
                    period after I left. I think they've stopped now, the budget apparently won't
                    carry it anymore. But they're a very useful process in which you try to draw up
                    a series of challenges to a post of a crisis nature, adapted to the real life
                    situation of the post. In other words, you try to work out a scenario that will
                    include political situation, etc. of the country. Then you go and put on a
                    variety of different crises, from bomb threats to fires to kidnappings to
                    airplane hijackings to mob demonstrations, mysterious break-ins, etc. And then
                    try to see how the embassy responds to it.</p>
                <p>It's a kind of a table-top exercise. It can be very useful to seeing what are the
                    kinds of things Embassies need to be ready for in the beginning, before the
                    crisis hits, to try to get ready. I think that was useful.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I got into was through the declassification center. After I
                    started working there along came the Iran Contra scandal. I and three or four
                    other people ended up being detailed to work on the documents involved in the
                    Iran Contra scandal. This went on, believe it or not, for something like 5 years
                    off and on, from when the scandal first hit the fan. I think we started working
                    on it in April of '87. The scandal came to light, if you remember, in November
                    '86.</p>
                <p>We worked first over in the Old Executive Office building reviewing documents
                    that came from all over the government. We formed what was called the
                    Interagency Review Group, the IRG. We worked first in trying to draw the papers
                    together that were needed for the congressional hearings. The Reagan
                    administration put out a requirement that all government agencies were to
                    provide any relevant material to the Interagency Review Group and then to the
                    Congress. Well actually, I guess to the Congress, but we looked through the
                    papers first to vet them and to make sure we knew what was going on.</p>
                <p>And to try to deal with the classification problem. And we first had the Tower
                    Board, the three member group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Tower.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>MATTHEWS: John Tower, General Scowcroft and Ed Muskie was the 3rd member of the
                    Board. Then there were the congressional hearings and finally there was the
                    appointment of Judge Walsh, the Independent Counsel.</p>
                <p>Throughout this whole 5-year period, we were involved in trying to search for
                    additional documents, trying to maintain a registry of all the different
                    documents that came through. Reviewing the classifications of documents whose
                    contents could be released, and deciding if they couldn't be released, were
                    there ways in which you could make redactions to make them releasable for use in
                    the trials.</p>
                <p>We, in effect, were the liaison group, or the group that sat in the middle
                    between the Independent Counsel and the Defense teams and the government
                    agencies, in terms of the handling of the documents and the material that went
                    into the whole Iran Contra investigation.</p>
                <p>It was a fascinating exercise seeing all the different kinds of activities that
                    went on in the various government agencies. We were composed of the CIA, the
                    NSA, the Defense Department, the Justice Department, the NSC and the State
                    Department. We met, almost everyday depending on how intense things were going.
                    It kept up for quite a long time—five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the paper trail that you were
                        seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MATTHEWS: I think Judge Walsh put it pretty well together. I think he was perhaps
                    too ambitious in his initial attempts to go after the culprits in this. I think
                    his initial efforts to try to get a conspiracy conviction for both North and
                    Poindexter, and eventually he had to back of in the trial, was a tactical
                    mistake at the beginning of his process.</p>
                <p>The most serious problem though was the granting of immunity by the Congress to
                    North and Poindexter, which in the end meant that the convictions he obtained
                    for both of them were set aside even though they're clearly guilty. The standard
                    that the Appeals Court set for the use of immunized material is virtually
                    impossible for a prosecutor to meet, even though Judge Walsh set up a system
                    fairly early on, so that most of his attorneys had no knowledge of what the
                    immunized testimony was.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>He did not believe that it was necessary to assure that the witnesses who were
                    called in the case had not seen anything of the immunized testimony, which would
                    be virtually impossible. And he did not anticipate that the court would hold
                    that he had to assure that every single thing that each witness testified to had
                    not been affected by their having heard immunized testimony. And that is
                    virtually impossible for any prosecutor to be able to do. It's a lesson
                    certainly for the future, that if any immunity is granted to witnesses, you
                    should forget about trying to bring about a prosecution.I think that Walsh was a
                    real tiger on this, he pursued it at great length and I think it's too bad that
                    he received such bad publicity on the length of his investigation. I think he
                    ended up probably a pretty bitter person. But he certainly went after this just
                    as long as he could. I'm not convinced that there was a conspiracy at the end
                    amongst the senior officials to conduct a coverup, as he felt there was, but
                    otherwise I think he was pretty much right on.</p>
                <p>It was really fascinating to see all the documents that went through. And to see
                    a lot of stuff that normally you would never see as a foreign service officer,
                    internal material from some of the other agencies, a real eye-opener.</p>
