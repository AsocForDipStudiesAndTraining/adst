                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 20, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 20, 1997. This is an interview with Ken
                        Yates being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and
                        Training and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Ken, could you tell me when and
                        where you were born and something about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I was born in New London, Connecticut on the 10th of November, 1940. I
                    began with the Second World War. My father was a salesman. He had the eastern
                    part of Connecticut for Sunshine Biscuits and sold cookies. At the time I was
                    born, my mother was not working, but when I got a little older, she entered the
                    workforce and we became a two-income family. I grew up in Mystic, Connecticut,
                    which is a small seaport town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whaling town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. The whaling museum was right across the street from where I grew up.
                    I used to go over the railing and wander around the museum. It was almost
                    abandoned and wasn't much then. They had the Charles Morgan, an old whaling
                    ship. As a child, my father played on the Charles Morgan when it was a derelict
                    wreck in New Bedford harbor, so we had a family tie to that boat. The Mystic
                    Marine Museum consisted of a reconstructed shipyard with supporting buildings,
                    including a rope-walk, a ship's chandlery, a sail loft, church, apothecary,
                    school, and a variety of other period buildings including homes. Each building
                    had been disassembled at its original site, the pieces numbered and recorded,
                    and then reassembled in Mystic. For example, the old original New York Yacht
                    Club Building was brought to Mystic.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Today, the educational facilities have been expanded but the basic museum was
                    there at the time. Now it costs a high price for a ticket, but then nobody cared
                    if the locals went in and out. I wandered around for many hours. I suspect my
                    interest in Asia became firmly rooted at this time. The collection included a
                    lot of Chinese artifacts, because the whaling ships left the east coast and
                    sailed around the Horn and up into the Pacific where they spent years in the
                    whaling grounds there. China was a coaling station and a place for water and
                    fresh vegetables, so I learned a little bit about history and got a little sense
                    of the rest of the world by jumping over the fence. For example, the ships had
                    rocks in the bottom of the hulls for ballast, but when in Canton (Guangzhou) or
                    similar Chinese ports, they took the rocks out and substituted blue and white
                    pottery which was cheap in China but brought a good price back in New England. A
                    lot of the blue and white Chinese ware that shows up in antique shops in the
                    area probably made its trip to America as replacement ballast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I went to a small town high school in Stonington and graduated in 1958.
                    Mystic was then, as now, only a village divided between the towns of Stonington
                    and Groton. Since I lived on the Stonington side of the Mystic River, I went to
                    Stonington High School. I was part of the group that was post-sputnik.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you explain “post-sputnik”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was when the Russians put up their first satellite, that little
                    beeping grapefruit that circled the earth and made such a splash. All patriotic
                    Americans then wanted to become engineers. I was a member of the civil air
                    patrol, of the Boy Scout Explorers, and most other civic youth groups that were
                    popular at the time such as the 4-H clubs. I was the local cadet commander in
                    the civil air patrol and had maxed out on the science portions of the Scholastic
                    Aptitude Tests, so I was given a strong nudge to become an engineer. I looked
                    around for engineering schools including MIT, Stevens, and the smaller Clarkson
                    College of Technology.</p>
                <p>My choice was Clarkson in Potsdam, NY, a small, pretty good engineering college,
                    where I soon found myself working 16-18 hours a day in study. You couldn't read
                    a newspaper, listen to the radio (television wasn't such a big deal at that
                    time), or have a social life. It was a slide rule on the hip and a constant
                    grind of math, physics, and chemistry. My life consisted of classes all day,
                    study at night, as much sleep as I could get, and then early rising to study in
                    the dorm cafeteria until the breakfast crowd forced me out. I was stimulated by
                    the science and confused by the math. It wasn't long before the boredom with the
                    math and the frustration with seemingly overly picky profs, who would not even
                    allow erasures in work that was turned in, for me to burn out in my first
                    year.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>To give some variety to life, I became part of a church group and even sang in
                    the choir. There was a small Episcopalian church on a little island in the
                    middle of the river that divided the two parts of the Clarkson campus. Each
                    morning on the way to classes all the students had to pass over that island and
                    usually by the wisecracking priest sitting on the steps of the rectory. During
                    the mild hazing that went on during the first weeks at school, the priest would
                    sit on those steps and jeer as the embarrassed freshmen paraded by. There was
                    one particular onerous custom of 'backwards day' when all Freshmen had to wear
                    all items of clothing, shirts, pants, belts, an even the foolish little beanie
                    that was part of the freshman's trials, backward. That is save for shoes and
                    socks. Of course, you also had to walk backwards wherever you went.</p>
                <p>To this spectacle, the priest would heckle “Are you going to take that?” “Are you
                    men or mice?” There was some irritation on the part of the upper-classmen with
                    the clerical interference, and there was a rumor that the school had even placed
                    pressure on the church to make him stop interfering with school rituals. Perhaps
                    his independence and scorn for the foolishness of the custom increased my
                    appreciation of his presence and the church. I had been an acolyte in the local
                    Episcopal Church in Mystic where my parents belonged. My mother was an
                    occasional soloist for the church. In fact, she had earned a bit of money hiring
                    out as a soloist to a variety of the churches in the area to augment the less
                    professional choirs.</p>
                <p>As a kid, I recall being dragged around on Sundays, while my father delivered and
                    then picked up my mother at her soloist duties. I rarely attended the churches
                    where she sang, but on the Sundays that she had no work, we attended the
                    Episcopal Church in Mystic. There I served as an acolyte, helping out with the
                    service and with the priest (we called him minister) during communion or
                    carrying the cross during the procession which began and ended the service. At
                    one time or another, a career in the ministry crossed my mind but never stayed
                    long.</p>
                <p>This renegade, rough priest asked me one day what was the matter. I told him that
                    I didn't like what I was doing. He said, “If you don't like what you are doing,
                    why don't you quit?” I said, “If I quit, what am I going to do?” My father had
                    gone into private business for himself, and it hadn't worked out, so there was
                    not much money to be had at home. He said, “Then, if you can't make up your
                    mind, go join the Army.” I gave it some thought, walking across the bridge back
                    to my dormitory on that very cold night, staring for a long time at the black
                    night river. By the time I got back to the dorm, I had decided to quit after my
                    freshman year and join the military. At the time, all able bodied males were
                    expected to put in their time in the military service. While I was deferred for
                    the time I spent in college, as soon as I came off full-time study, I would be
                    subject to the draft. Enlistment would be preferable to the draft, since you
                    could choose a field and receive training. I spent three years in the U.S.
                    Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1958-61?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes. Although I had been a cadet commander in the Civil Air Patrol and had
                    intended to pursue an aeronautical engineering career after the service, I
                    enlisted in the Army and not the Air Force, because an Air Force enlistment
                    would have meant a commitment of four years. The Army offered three years and a
                    choice of what I would do. Since I had a year of college, the recruiter in New
                    London said that I could enlist in the Army Security Agency and receive advanced
                    training at such places as the Presidio iMonterey, California for Russian
                    language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm a graduate of the Presidio, too. I was in the Air
                        Force from 1950-51, a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Well, I never got there. After Basic Training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, I
                    moved to Fort Devens in Massachusetts and took the Army's language aptitude test
                    and was about number eight in the large group that was tested at that time. They
                    said, “Fine, you are in like Flynn. Get your gear together.” When I went down to
                    a preliminary session they had, I was told there was one problem. Only eight
                    people could go. The first seven on the list were going to go, but the eighth
                    could not, because some NCO had re-upped for the purpose of going to language
                    school. While he was not among the top finalists, there was evidently greater
                    priority given to someone with more stripes than I had, and he was bumped up to
                    my place. So I never got to go the Presidio for Russian studies.</p>
                <p>However, I got some Russian at Fort Devens, where I was assigned to training as a
                    Traffic Analyst. Instead of being assigned to Asmara or some other isolated
                    place where Russian linguists were needed, the Army sent me to Japan after
                    almost a year of training. My job was classified at the time, but my 10 years of
                    promised silence expired long ago. From our wire encircled operations building
                    in the lonely outskirts of Chitose, we were listening to Soviet military units
                    in the eastern part of Siberia.</p>
                <p>Essentially, all I would do was to sit every morning at a desk and try to match
                    up the wiring diagrams of the Russian military units assigned in the Far East
                    and try to work out which units were which in the piles of intercepted radio
                    traffic. Of course, almost all of the traffic was encrypted, so we were expected
                    to first break as much of the code as possible and then determine what the unit
                    was. Once we identified the units and began to decipher messages, we would
                    package it up in a bale and send it back to NSA in Washington. All of the
                    traffic was in Russian, but most of the work was call-sign identification or
                    similar shorthand, and little linguistic skill was needed. It was kind of fun
                    but not very taxing work. A lot of the traffic was impossible to break, but now
                    and then, we would have a lapse into the clear and that would give us at least a
                    start at deciphering the “one-time-page” that the whole theater was using for
                    that day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you stationed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>YATES: At Chitose on the island of Hokkaido in northern Japan. It was cold
                    sometimes, but a very beautiful part of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't stationed up at Wakanai?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was Air Force. Army was at Chitose. Chitose was a former U.S. air
                    base that had been turned over to the Japanese for their Air Self-Defense
                    Forces. We were a tenant at their base, then called “Chit-1.” That portion of
                    the base also served as a commercial airport for all of Hokkaido. When I was
                    there, the U.S. troops were gradually turning over more portions of “Chit-1” and
                    moving to new brick barracks at “Chit-2” southeast of the city and closer to the
                    remotely located operations building which had a large adjacent antenna
                    field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent some time at Misawa. Wakanai was sort of the
                        Siberia of the Air Force. I was doing the same thing. But this was when the
                        Korean war was just dying down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I missed the Korean war but came close to involvement in the Vietnam war.
                    Toward the end of my tour at Chitose, I was offered the chance to go to Saigon
                    with an ASA(?) unit which had been promised a civilian clothing allowance,
                    living in a hotel, and lots of chances to see Southeast Asia. Called “Operation
                    White Birch,” it was very appealing. However, I had been saving some of my
                    salary each month in what evidently was an illegal account in a Japanese bank in
                    downtown Chitose. At the time there were limitations on the amount of Yen you
                    could exchange, so I decided to open a Japanese bank account to accumulate
                    enough cash to allow a grand trip around Japan toward the end of my tour.</p>
                <p>Since going to Saigon would mean abandoning my plans to see Japan, I decided not
                    to volunteer for “White Birch.” That was lucky, since I later heard that those
                    who went ended up in tents in the mud, wearing fatigues, and later some became
                    among the first American casualties when a jeep in which they were riding struck
                    a mine.</p>
                <p>Hokkaido was fun. Pretty simple work. You did your job and got promoted and
                    everything was fine. I ended up as a Spec (Specialist) 5 or buck sergeant. It
                    was a reasonably honorable career.</p>

                <p>YATES: I spent a lot of time off-duty. When I was an analyst, there were about
                    five of us on a “trick.” You only worked day “tricks,” and it was not terribly
                    intense. One or two of us could cover the day's work in a couple of hours. So we
                    worked out a schedule to allow us to take off when the work was done. I worked
                    about three days a week and had time on my hands. Most of us who lived there for
                    more than a couple of weeks and were not part of the units of “trick animals,”
                    (the poor souls who sat with headphones on and listened to code all night),
                    usually had rooms in town which cost the equivalent of about $15, the yen being
                    worth 360 to the dollar. Some picked up girl friends and had a sort of family
                    life in town; I didn't. Instead, I decided I wanted to see more of Japan and
                    wandered up to Sapporo, the provincial capital of Hokkaido.</p>
                <p>In Sapporo, the U.S. had an American Center run by John MacDonald, a USIA (United
                    States Information Agency) officer who spent almost his entire Foreign Service
                    career in Japan. He had a Japanese wife and spoke wonderful Japanese. He had
                    marvelous contacts among labor groups in Japan since he played golf and sort of
                    fell into that group. In later years, he was THE expert on labor because of his
                    incredibly good contacts. John asked me what I was doing as an American
                    wandering around the library. I replied, “Nothing much.” He said, “Well, why
                    don't you teach English?” I thought that would be a good idea and eventually
                    ended up teaching three classes a week at the Sapporo USIS (United States
                    Information Service) center. I had a junior high class, a class of junior
                    college teachers, and then a general class of adults.</p>
                <p>One very colorful character who came was Dr. Murakami, a medical doctor who was a
                    Buddhist. He was a very strong Buddhist, who had an immense curiosity about
                    religions of all stripes. He was deeply interested in Christianity, Shintoism,
                    and studying languages. In his late 60s when he joined my class, he always
                    carried a large, battered briefcase full of papers. A marvelous gentleman. He
                    came to just about every class of mine that he could, except the student
                    classes. I don't know if he learned much English, but he certainly was fun to
                    have around.</p>
                <p>This experience set me off on another track. I earlier mentioned the bank account
                    I had in Chitose in preparation for a long trip around Japan. In almost two
                    years of saving money, I accumulated enough to embark on a wandering of about 30
                    days, just the length of validity of a Japan National Railways pass and about as
                    much leave time as I could earn. I even had a little stamp, a seal, to use to
                    make my mark in my bank book when I made deposits. My name was “Ichiro
                    Yamamoto,” a sort of Japanese “Joe Smith.” It was undoubtedly illegal according
                    to the rules of the time, but at the time, the bank was happy to take my money.
                    Little by little, I saved around $1000 which was enough to take a 30 day trip
                    around Japan. I bought a JNR (Japan National Railway) rail pass and a camera and
                    got on the train. I spent 30 days wandering from city to city. If I liked a
                    place, I stayed; if I didn't, I would get on a train and ride until I got tired
                    or arrived someplace I wanted to see and then got off. I had studied Japanese at
                    the University of Maryland, so I had enough Japanese to get around.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>On arrival at a railroad station, the first thing I would do would be to buy a
                    Japanese map with bus routes on it, so I could tell what buses to take. I had a
                    JNR guidebook which was a small encyclopedia on Japan. It had tissue thin pages
                    and very small print, but it was a gold mine of information with plenty of maps.
                    So between the JNR guidebook and the local bus map, I had pretty good
                    information about the lay of the land. Then I would go outside the railroad
                    station and get a cab. The driver would ask where I wanted to go and I would
                    say, “Any place where it is cheap.” I had allowed $3 a night (about 1,000 Yen)
                    which put me in some very run down places. Yet most of the time the taxi drivers
                    got me to some very fine, small student hostel type place. In those days the
                    Japanese inns were the cheapest places to stay. I had a ball.</p>
                <p>I spent almost two weeks of my month in Kyoto. Kyoto at the time had street cars.
                    At night, I could climb up on top of the ryokan and look over the city. Right
                    next door to where I stayed was a maiko boarding place where the younger girls
                    were training to become geisha. It was like a girls' school dormitory. Every
                    night before they would go out, they would spend hours getting made up and then
                    prior to going out, they would take a walk to get some air, to relax a bit
                    before going to their parties. If you went out and sat on the little bridge over
                    a stream, sure enough there were several maikos who came out for their air
                    before going off in their cars. So this way, you could see them. Every night, I
                    would go out and sit on the bridge, and they got to recognize me and would greet
                    me. It was very enjoyable.</p>
                <p>One night I was sitting on one side of the bridge, and a very expensive Japanese
                    car pulled up on the other side of the bridge and stopped. Out of it got a
                    younger man, kind of pudgy with a large amount of camera gear. He obviously knew
                    that the maiko were going to come out and walk over the bridge. Without paying
                    any attention to me, he got all set up with his cameras at the ready. Soon, one
                    of the maiko came out and about the same time spotted the young man with the
                    camera. She walked up on my side of the bridge and across from the nervous young
                    man and his cameras. As she neared me seated in my accustomed place on the
                    railing, she stopped and greeted me. “Konbanwa” she said with a little, polite
                    bow. Of course, I responded “Konbanwa” and returned the bow.</p>
                <p>She then walked away with a giggle. I looked across the bridge, and there was my
                    Japanese friend with his mouth at full gape. The scene of a foreigner involved
                    with a cultural icon was something he had been completely unprepared for. The
                    incredibility of the scene had clearly overloaded his reason, and he had
                    forgotten all about his pictures. Recovering a bit, he was very frustrated with
                    his lapse and most unhappy. All things ended well, however, since the maiko, on
                    her return, stopped and let him take some of the lost pictures. He departed
                    happily. Over the all-too-few days I spent observing these nightly strolls, the
                    maiko of the school became distantly acquainted with the strange foreigner with
                    the short haircut. Eventually, they gave me their small and unique calling
                    cards. Unlike the usual business cards, they were smaller and featured only
                    their names in cursive Japanese “kana” in bright pastel colors. I still keep
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One afternoon, I decided to pay a call on my often noisy neighbors. I was
                    interested in the social aspect of this and what went on in the boarding house
                    next door. Often in the evenings, I would climb up to the roof of the ryokan to
                    view the sunset over the western hills of Kyoto and watch night creep in.
                    Particularly before the maiko would go off to their evening entertainments, they
                    would be scrambling and chattering like all teenage girls, raising a fuss and
                    destroying whatever solitude I had on the roof.</p>
                <p>So one afternoon I went next door and entered the entry hall, the genkan, and
                    knocked on the inner shoji, a door with rice paper covering the wooden lattice,
                    and said, “Hi, I'm your neighbor.” The head mistress of the school came to the
                    door and was instantly mistrustful of my motives. Foreigners are not commonly
                    visitors to maiko schools, I assumed, and I tried to assure here that I was
                    merely curious about how the school operated, where the students came from and
                    why, and what the study was like.</p>
                <p>The lady of the house was appropriately suspicious, but after a bit of prodding,
                    evidently decided that I was probably harmless and, perhaps reluctantly,
                    admitted me to sit and watch as one of the maiko put on her evening makeup. My
                    halting Japanese was sufficient to make small talk as the cultural experience
                    unfolded before my eyes. I spent no more than about thirty minutes making small
                    talk while the maiko had her hair fixed in the classical style and had the
                    special makeup applied. The students were essentially just kids from the
                    country, about 15, 16 or 17 years old, and all intended to become full geisha in
                    time. In the old tradition, the geisha of Japan were not prostitutes but
                    courtesans. They sang, danced, and helped restaurant customers relax and enjoy
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Degradation into various forms of prostitution came later on, as geisha sought a
                    more lucrative arrangement with their usually wealthy clients who sometimes
                    became infatuated with one or another of the geisha who entertained them.
                    Perhaps that is natural when you place generally poor girls with rich and often
                    bored men. Geisha could acquire rich patrons who eventually took them as
                    mistresses and thus assured them of a financially secure future or at least gave
                    them the backing to open their own restaurants or entertainment houses as they
                    got older and no longer were as attractive to the clientele.</p>
                <p>Those in the maiko training school were trying to follow the original concept of
                    the maiko and spent years in training, learning the songs, dances, instruments,
                    and performances that were a part of the usual repertory. In these performances,
                    the maiko were distinguished by the wearing of the long obi, a sash that goes
                    around the Japanese kimono but has long tails that reach almost to the ground.
                    This was the mark of a maiko or someone who is unmarried. The older or married
                    geisha wore an obi without tails and wrapped in a sort of square of brocade
                    neatly tucked above the hips.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>After about 45 minutes of this cultural experience, I heard a commotion in the
                    entryway, and sure enough, there was my landlady, very agitated and wanting to
                    know what I was doing there. She had become rather motherly after my first week
                    staying in her ryokan. She was upset that I would have the brass to walk next
                    door and bang on the door of this school. She said, “You must leave this place
                    immediately. This is no place for an American GI.” This, of course, was true, so
                    I did. But my all too short foray into the school next door was a fascinating
                    bit of insight into an aspect of Japanese culture, rarely visible to foreigners
                    and probably many Japanese.</p>
                <p>Kyoto is still the cultural capital of Japan. But at that time, it possessed an
                    aura of the ancient Japan only seen in romantic novels or on the screen. You
                    could see people wearing Japanese clothing and “geta” (footwear) outside. When
                    it rained, the city quieted down to a soft murmur. You would look out the window
                    and see rain falling on dark wood buildings on a street with no cars, people in
                    kimono walking along with the old oil paper umbrellas. It was beautiful. There
                    were several parts of the city that were most attractive. At Kyomizudera, a
                    Buddhist temple sited on the side of a hill overlooking the city, you could
                    still grasp the remarkable inventiveness of the old wooden architecture. At
                    Kokedera, the moss temple that contained thousands of varieties of rare mosses,
                    was still not overrun with tourists; eventually, it had to be closed because of
                    the danger of destroying the very mosses that made it important.</p>
                <p>One of my most memorable walks in Kyoto was on a quiet Sunday morning when I
                    decided to walk the considerable distance to the Nijo castle in the morning
                    before breakfast. The city was still getting in motion, but the sun was up and
                    very warm despite the early hour. On a side street near the castle, hunger
                    finally got the better of me, and I entered a small coffee shop, looking for
                    something to eat. All that was available was “morning coffee” which consisted of
                    a raw egg yolk dropped into very strong and hot coffee. Along with this unique
                    beverage was served toast in the very thick slices in which Japanese bread was
                    traditionally cut. When the bread is toasted, the outside is golden brown and
                    crisp, but the center remains very white and soft. Sitting in the small coffee
                    shop as the owner busied himself outside sweeping the side walk, stirring my
                    “morning coffee” with the miniature spoon like that served with a demitasse, and
                    crunching the crisp-soft toast, I knew one of the most peaceful moments I can
                    remember. I very much enjoyed Kyoto.</p>
                <p>The trip, of course, was full of significance for me. I traveled all the way down
                    as far as Nagasaki and Kumamoto. This trip really got my feet into Asia. Japan
                    at the time was poor. People forget, even the Japanese forget, that Japan after
                    the war was not in very good economic shape. This was particularly true in
                    Hokkaido, where the economy was primarily agricultural and modern society had
                    not made significant inroads. The GI chapel in Chitose had organized a small
                    work group of three of us to take a “deuce and a half,” a two and a half ton
                    army truck, to drive over the mountains to help some farmers build a pig barn on
                    the western coast of Hokkaido.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>In the mid-1950s, Soviet trawlers had begun to fan out from Vladivostok, and they
                    were vacuuming the sea of fish. A small fleet of boats would be organized about
                    a large factory ship. They would drop large drag nets and essentially sweep the
                    sea. They were doing this right off the coast of Hokkaido. Japanese fishermen
                    with their old wooden boats, used for centuries, would go out and find there
                    were no fish. They were literally starving. There was nothing there for them to
                    eat.</p>
                <p>A Texas oil millionaire came in with a program which I believe still exists
                    today, where he went around the world trying to find places where people needed
                    help. He wouldn't give them money but gave them pigs. Two or three dozen pigs
                    would be given to a village. The farmers in return would have to give the first
                    litter of pigs to the rest of the community for distribution in pairs. Of
                    course, a single litter of pigs consisted of many piglets, so in a short time,
                    pigs were everywhere. It was an enormous success. The former fishermen got pork
                    to eat, and the pigs were easy to maintain, but they had to have some place
                    where they could breed and raise the piglets. So a few of us took a truck up
                    over the mountains to a place called Setana, on the west coast of Hokkaido. We
                    helped them lug stones up a hill where they were going to build a barn. They
                    needed the stone for the foundation.</p>
                <p>We did that for about a week, living there in a little house that was built near
                    where the barn was to be built. We had a marvelous time, because there were
                    young Japanese volunteers there also. We would work, meet, and sleep together.
                    We GIs were put upstairs in the loft. I will never forget the first night I went
                    up to the loft, and there was nobody there, so we put our sleeping bags on the
                    floor and went to sleep. The next morning I woke up to noise and commotion and
                    discovered there was a girl in a sleeping bag asleep next to me. The whole place
                    was full of kids. We hadn't heard them come in, we were so tired. This was quite
                    a sensation for a young GI but great fun.</p>

                <p>YATES: During my trip around Japan, I often stayed more than one day in a place,
                    as it was fun to find a seat somewhere and watch people. In Kyoto while at a
                    temple, I heard a commotion outside and wandered over to see what was going on.
                    There was an older American and a woman I took to be his wife having a loud
                    argument with a taxi driver. At least, he was having an argument. Perhaps in the
                    conviction that simply raising his voice would bring about greater
                    understanding, the man was almost shouting and a small crowd of curious Japanese
                    had gathered. His wife was ineffectually trying to calm him down.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Since I spoke some Japanese, I went over and pulled the wife aside and asked if I
                    could help. She said, “Please do, this is getting out of hand.” I asked what
                    they wanted, and she said just to get back to their hotel. The taxi driver had
                    no idea what her husband was talking about. I explained to the driver where they
                    wanted to go and he said, “Fine, no problem.” They got into the cab and before
                    leaving, asked me to join them for lunch. Never quick to turn down a free meal
                    to augment my budget, I went with them.</p>
                <p>It turned out that he was a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania.
                    He asked me what plans I had and what I would do after leaving the Army. I said
                    I wasn't sure but knew that it probably would have something to do with the
                    study of Asia. I had been thinking of the Foreign Service. He asked, “Why don't
                    you go to Penn?” That sounded good to me. Anything like that would be
                    attractive, but I did not have the kind of money that would permit such a
                    school. He replied, “Well, I have a friend who works in a bank. If you come to
                    Philadelphia, I will give my friend a call, and he probably will give you a job
                    for support while you attend school.”</p>
                <p>So after I got back home, I borrowed the family car and drove to Philadelphia and
                    looked up my new friends. Professor Foster Nix was a physics professor at the
                    university and had a role in the Manhattan Project, which developed the nuclear
                    bomb that ended the war in the Pacific. The Nix's lived in West Chester, outside
                    of Philadelphia. There on the top of a hill, they had built their home with a
                    greenhouse as part of the very comfortable lifestyle they shared. On several
                    occasions, I recall the remarkable salads Mrs. Nix would prepare for lunch made
                    from the freshly harvested lettuce straight from that greenhouse. The professor,
                    true to his word called his friend, who turned out to be a Vice President at
                    First Pennsylvania, and I got a job in the Transit Department processing checks
                    on the midnight shift.</p>
                <p>After returning the family car to Connecticut, I returned to Philadelphia by bus
                    and began living at the Y, an awful place that harbored a strange assortment of
                    young hopefuls and old hopeless. But it was only a few blocks from the 15th and
                    Chestnut offices of First Pennsylvania. Meals were often to be had at a classic
                    greasy-spoon across the street from the Y. There, you could get almost edible
                    meatloaf, lumpy mashed potatoes, and coffee into which you could pour as much
                    sugar as would dissolve and thereby get enough calories to sustain a day of work
                    and study. I began working the midnight shift and enrolled at the University of
                    Pennsylvania where I could take both day and evening classes. Sleep had to be
                    grabbed in the remaining hours.</p>
                <p>I knew what I wanted to do; I wanted to get into the Foreign Service. John
                    MacDonald, the USIS Branch Public Affairs Officer Sapporo, had suggested that
                    joining the Foreign Service was something I should consider. Since I had become
                    very much wrapped up in the history, culture, and people of Japan, I thought
                    that was a good idea. Naturally, I knew nothing of the process or requirements
                    of entry. When I quizzed John about how I might approach that, he said, “You
                    take an exam which is kind of a muddle of everything.” I asked how I might study
                    for it. He replied, “There is one thing that you could do. Everyday read the New
                    York Times. If you do that, in a couple of years you will be ready for the
                    Foreign Service exam.”</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Accepting his advice, I tried to do this along with my work at Penn. It took me
                    six years to get a four year degree, since for most of the time, I could only
                    study part time. I worked the night shift, so I could take classes in the
                    morning and afternoon. I couldn't take a full course load, but I got
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: International affairs. It was just what I wanted. Still, I made a few
                    bone-headed mistakes. For example, I decided to take Russian, because I had
                    Russian before and it seemed like the logical thing to do. It was a summer
                    course, very intensive, a full year in eight weeks. I blew it completely. They
                    switched the course time on me. It was supposed to be from 9-12 every day, which
                    was barely possible since I got out of work around 8:00. But then they made it
                    8-11 to accommodate the instructor. This meant I was missing an hour a day of
                    class and I was falling asleep in the warm summer classroom to boot.</p>
                <p>I was flunking so badly that before my mid-terms I went to my instructor and
                    asked what I should do. He suggested I get a tutor, so I found a younger girl
                    who agreed to tutor me at no charge. So weekends and whenever I had the time, I
                    got on my Vespa motor scooter and headed out to the Main Line where my tutor
                    lived in an enormous house. Her father was in business and clearly was very well
                    off.</p>
                <p>I worked hard but had little hope. Nonetheless, after almost completely blowing
                    away the mid-term, I stumbled through the rest of the course and got a B on the
                    final. My instructor was dumbfounded, for he knew that I had little command of
                    the Russian language. Still, he could neither give me a B or fail me, so he
                    proposed a compromise. If I promised never to study Russian again, he would give
                    me a C. I thought that was good enough to get me out of a precarious situation
                    with minimal effect on my grade point average and accepted.</p>
                <p>During my time at Penn I was a computer operator at the bank. I started in the
                    Transit Department, but after only a few months there, came to the conclusion
                    that the grinding work did not give me any time to study, unlike others who were
                    in the Data Processing Department where they sat around monitoring computers and
                    had plenty of time to read or do other things. Since few wished to work straight
                    midnight hours when the Bank did most of its computer work, I was able to work a
                    transfer and began work in the world of computers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Computers were in their infancy then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes. They had vacuum tubes, and the computer filled a very large room. We
                    had a resident engineer who slept in a little room on the side. Whenever we had
                    a problem, he would come out with a screwdriver in his pocket. A common way of
                    finding a glitch in the computer was to open all the compartments and look at
                    the vacuum tubes. He would mount a test program and then run his screwdriver
                    clinking across the tubes until the computer stopped. He would pull out the tube
                    that caused the stop, put in a new tube, close the computer doors, and go back
                    to sleep. That was how you fixed the computer in those days.</p>
                <p>It was a computer over which the operator really had full control. You could even
                    step through each separate line of the program with special switches that
                    executed one step at a time. This was useful in diagnosing problems. You also
                    had full banks of neon lamps which showed you the contents of buffersread
                    buffers, memory buffers, print buffers, etc. Everything that the computer could
                    do for you was fully displayed. You could stop the computer with a stop switch
                    and see what the computer was doing by reading the machine language buffers. The
                    operator could manually program the computer by changing the values of the neons
                    in the command buffer.</p>
                <p>With the special machine language commands at the console, you could move tape
                    drives. If you had a read error, you could attempt to read a sequence of blocks
                    on the tape and try to discover what was wrong. If the error was really gross,
                    the operator had the option to go to the problem drive, lift out the 3/4” tape
                    from the drive and place it in a holder on which a solution containing iron
                    filings was poured. Once the fluid evaporated, the iron filings would be left in
                    a pattern revealing the contents of the record on the tape. If it could be read
                    manually with the error obvious, those contents could be inserted in the
                    appropriate buffer through the neons on the control console, the tape
                    re-positioned, the program backed up and stepped along that segment, and the
                    processing resumed. That was how you fixed things in those days. It was a lot of
                    fun.</p>
                <p>One difficulty was that I was there during a period of transition. I was an
                    operator who ran the two Burroughs 220 computers, the one that First
                    Pennsylvania used in processing its own work and the one that about a dozen
                    correspondent banks in the Philadelphia area used. To keep up with the times and
                    the competition, the bank had replaced the old, vacuum tube Burroughs 220 with a
                    new multiprocessing system in another building out near the 30th Street railroad
                    station on Market Street. So all the computer operators, supervisors, and all
                    the big shots who ran things wanted to be out in the new facility. Since I was
                    the junior of the crowd, they left me with the two old computers - and all of
                    the work. All my plans for extra time to study while the machines worked were
                    lost. Keeping two mainframe computers fed with needed input tapes, supplying the
                    two high-speed drum printers with paper for the output journals, and working out
                    intermittent problems with the aging computers kept me hopping. I ran all the
                    bank's work every night for about six months.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>A consequence was, when they finally closed the old facility and moved to the new
                    one, I knew everything there was to know about that old computer and the
                    programs. So when they needed someone to fix problems, they had to come to me.
                    Eventually, I moved up and became the supervisor on the midnight shift.
                    Actually, I was making more money than I did when I later entered the Foreign
                    Service. I had to take a cut of about $2000 a year when I came into the Foreign
                    Service. However, I didn't want to be a computer operator for the rest of my
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Penn was there any opportunity for you
                        to learn Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. I am not a great language student. You would think someone who has
                    been in the Foreign Service as long as I have been would be a marvelous language
                    student, but I am not. My three languages now are Japanese, Korean, and Chinese,
                    which is kind of strange for somebody who is not adept at languages. The Foreign
                    Service Institute scale labels these three languages among the most difficult of
                    any major world languages for the English speaker to learn. Korean is number one
                    on that list, and naturally, was the one I eventually had the greatest
                    experience in. Japanese and Chinese are also among the top few, mixed in with
                    Arabic and some of the Southeast Asian Languages.</p>
                <p>At the end of my time at Penn, I remembered the words of wisdom that John
                    MacDonald had given me about the exam. In addition to his instruction to keep
                    reading the New York Times from front to back, he counseled, “Whatever you do,
                    when you want to come into the Foreign Service, don't wait until you think you
                    are ready; take the exam several times for practice.” So in my final year as an
                    undergraduate at Penn, I signed up for the Foreign Service exam for
                    practice.</p>
                <p>I took it in a big room at Temple University. I told myself it was just a
                    practice run. It seemed okay. In fact, I enjoyed it and felt it was kind of fun.
                    My immediate plans were to go on for an MA in graduate school at Penn, working
                    nights and taking courses during the day. But after entering graduate school on
                    a path toward at least an MA, I got a letter saying “Congratulations! You have
                    passed the Foreign Service exam.” I went back to school, and one of my
                    instructors, who was also taking the Foreign Service exam, came up to me and
                    asked how I did. I said, “Okay. I passed it.” He said, “You did? Oh, well.” He
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>There were two of us from Penn that year that passed the exam. I was scheduled
                    for an oral exam in front of a panel in Washington. At the time, I didn't have a
                    way to get down, so the other guy offered to give me a ride. He was a very fine
                    historian, a very smart guy, in the graduate program taking European history. We
                    went down together and took the exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>YATES: It was 1967, and there isn't a lot that I remember about it. There were
                    four examiners at a table and another off to the side. Their technique was to
                    set you at ease by asking about your family and home. Then, they would quiz you
                    on an area in which you claimed some expertise. Of course, for me that was Japan
                    and Asia. The technique was to push and push and push. Keep asking more and more
                    complicated questions, until you could no longer give a knowledgeable answer. I
                    was told later that the point was how well you did when you ran out of
                    intellectual resources. What the examiners sought was how well you did in
                    controlling the situation. I didn't know that at the time. But it was still kind
                    of fun, because I was still in graduate school and had no intention of coming
                    into the Foreign Service at that point.</p>
                <p>I finished the oral and went out, and my friend who had preceded me in the exam
                    was sitting in the waiting area. He asked me how I did, and I said I didn't
                    know. We waited for a while for the results, since the examiners made their
                    determination on the spot and let you know before you left. It turned out that I
                    passed and he didn't. So as far as I know, I was the only Penn graduate that
                    year to join the Foreign Service. I have had no regrets. The Foreign Service has
                    had its moments of frustration, but the work is worth it. The Foreign Service
                    had a special purpose then, and it is probably needed now more than ever. World
                    relationships have grown more complex and difficult to assess now that the
                    earlier division of the world into two Cold-War camps is no longer available to
                    make it easy to determine friend and enemy. People are needed on the ground
                    around the world to keep informed on the real situation in those nations that
                    have the potential to destabilize the international order. The old Foreign
                    Service demanded something of those who would make it a career that is different
                    from the demands of the Foreign Service today. It was more like entering the
                    priesthood or a monastery. You were expected to sacrifice; you were expected to
                    give up things. What you gave up was contact with relatives, a settled life, and
                    any hope of becoming rich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or even really developing a stack, a good house, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: You didn't have any of that. You couldn't even own a car of your own
                    choice at the time I joined. When I graduated, I decided I was going to buy
                    something that I really wanted, a sports car, one of the first Nissan sports
                    cars that was imported into the US. At the time, it was called a “Nissan
                    Fairlady,” a canary-yellow two-seater with an aluminum engine and a fold-down
                    top with a tonneau to protect you if it was cold and you had the top down. I
                    loved that car, but I had to sell it because I wasn't allowed to own a sports
                    car and take an assignment to Korea. I had to sell that at a loss. So it was an
                    expensive experience for me. But I was convinced that joining the Foreign
                    Service was a good thing and something of value to do with my life.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: In August, 1967.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a choice of going to USIA or the State
                        Department at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: When you took the exam, you had to indicate in a block at the top of the
                    exam whether you wanted to join the Department of State or USIA. Because of my
                    time with John MacDonald, there was never any question but that I would join
                    USIA. At the time, however, all had to take a common Foreign Service exam and
                    come into the Service as regular Foreign Service Officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the composition and maybe the outlook
                        of your basic training class, the A100 course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was an experience. There were eleven of us going into USIA in that
                    course and maybe another 40 going into State. The USIA group would meet in USIA
                    headquarters at 1776 Pennsylvania Avenue, across from what used to be the Roger
                    Smith Hotel, and then join the State contingent for common training in Rosslyn
                    where FSI was then located. It was an interesting class. We obviously had
                    renegades in it, people who were not what you think of as a government employee
                    with a white shirt and dark suit. Most of the renegades were in the USIA crowd.
                    I remember one of the State guys was Teddy Roosevelt III, a former Navy seal and
                    himself a rebel of sorts.</p>
                <p>We had a problem in that class. When we got toward the end of it, the last week
                    or two, our instructors passed out very thick loose-leaf binders of consular
                    material to study and be qualified as Consular Officers. Those of us in the USIA
                    group got together and said we did not come in here to become Consular Officers
                    and felt our time would be better spent back at USIA preparing for our
                    assignments. There was a big fight over that. Dean Firth was Dean at FSI at the
                    time. Fred Chapin was the counselor for our group who took it as a personal
                    affront that we should be so rude and crude as to reject something that had been
                    planned for us by those who assumedly knew better. We had a fight on our hands.
                    Together, we caucused and decided that we would stand together and refuse to do
                    the consular course.</p>
                <p>It was a selfish goal since we had heard that earlier USIA Junior Officers had
                    arrived at Post only to be assigned to roundly disrespected Consular work,
                    stamping visas and interviewing applicants. We knew if we did not take the
                    Consular Course, we would not be authorized to serve as Consular Officers and
                    thereby would have to be left with USIA, regardless of the pressing needs in the
                    consular sections. Our choice was to go back to USIA and complete our A100
                    course there. We had not joined the Foreign Service to do consular work.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The rebellion and the practices it called into question went all the way to the
                    highest levels of the agency, and we had to go see Dean Firth in his office.
                    After much strain and red-faced argument, particularly by our course monitor,
                    the decision was made to allow us to opt out of the Consular Officer study.
                    Perhaps no one had the patience to sit for the difficulty of an inter-agency
                    fight and decided the easiest decision was to let the rebels go back to their
                    own agency. We went triumphantly back to USIA and never looked back. The irony
                    of this is, of course, that I had to take the consular course later when
                    consular work became part of my responsibilities in North Korea.</p>
                <p>But Fred Chapin never forgave me for that, or anyone else in that group. We got
                    black marks on our careers by very negative remarks in his evaluation of us at
                    this very early stage of our budding careers. Fred deemed such rebellion
                    unseemly for future Foreign Service Officers, but we held it as a banner of
                    spunk and creativity, both of which we had already decided were uncharacteristic
                    of the State officers whom we had observed in our orientation sessions. We
                    openly speculated over who among our peers in the A-100 course would drop out of
                    State soon because of the confining, stilted nature of their chosen
                    profession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm really surprised at this. It makes eminent sense that
                        there is a point when you tap things off when you have two distinct groups
                        like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I think Fred's point was that those were the orders, and you don't fight
                    the system. If you are going to be good Foreign Service Officers, you are going
                    to have to know how to take orders. He was really very, very angry.</p>
                <p>He showed up later in my career as head of the State Department inspection team
                    that looked at, not my operation, but the operation of the Department in
                    Reykjavik when I was there. Fred was gentleman enough not to mention the earlier
                    confrontation, and I had no real indication that he remembered. But I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting about the role of USIA at that time
                        in 1967? What was the spirit and role and goal of USIA then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I mentioned that as a GI in Japan, I had taught English in Sapporo at the
                    American Cultural Center three times a week. One of the things that I learned
                    from that experience was that the Japanese, at least, didn't have much of an
                    idea of what Americans were like but had an intense desire to know more. Save
                    for the American Center, there was really no place where they could easily come
                    to a clear understanding.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>In Hokkaido, there is a famous story of a man named William Clark, which I guess
                    influenced me as well. William Clark was a government employee with the
                    Department of Agriculture back in the 1800s who was assigned to a team to go to
                    Japan to give advice to the Japanese. Characteristically, the Japanese were not
                    interested in such unsolicited advice, so when he got to Tokyo, they had no
                    interest in him and sent him away to Hokkaido, Japan's frontier. He went to
                    Sapporo and essentially had nothing to do. Dissatisfied with wasting his time in
                    a job that went nowhere, Clark set about making a personal contribution.</p>
                <p>What he did was to found a university on the basis of what a New England college
                    looked like. Today, the campus of the University of Hokkaido looks like a New
                    England town, because the buildings, the layout, and the concept of the
                    university owe everything to William Clark. He also taught English while he was
                    there. He had a class of 18 students, as I understand it, that he taught for
                    only about a year.</p>
                <p>His class was all males, of course, and they were young and ambitious. He was in
                    Japan for only about 18 months, but he taught English, founded the University of
                    Hokkaido and had an influence on the thinking that went into laying out the
                    city. It was, on its own merits, a remarkable record of accomplishment. Thus,
                    Sapporo was one of the few provincial capitals of Japan that was laid out in a
                    regular way except what was destroyed in the war and rebuilt later. His short
                    stay at an end, he left Sapporo and hiked back south to get a boat to the main
                    island of Honshu and then back to Massachusetts. He left his students in a
                    little valley called Hiroshima Dani, where today there is a little statue of
                    him. His parting words to his students was “Boys be ambitious.” That has come
                    down in Hokkaido folklore to this time.</p>
                <p>A few of them really were ambitious, or at least took his advice to heart. Of the
                    18 students to whom he taught English, four became very senior officials in the
                    Japanese government, senior advisors called ginro. According to the folk tales,
                    they were among the few who strongly advised against the Japanese adventure in
                    China. They vehemently opposed Japanese actions in the Pacific against the
                    Americans. Had there been one, two, or three more William Clarks in Japan at
                    that time and had there been more ginro that had strongly urged against the
                    Japanese aggressiveness of the time, there might have been no incursions into
                    Korea, Manchuria, or China or at least involvement of a significantly less
                    aggressive nature, and we may not have fought the Second World War in the
                    Pacific.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>The story encouraged a conviction that if you had enough people to talk about
                    America, not selling an image but accurately telling people about America, much
                    difficulty might have been avoided. If the Japanese in the 1930s and 1940s had
                    understood about this country, they probably would not have fought against us,
                    probably would not have attacked Pearl Harbor, nor would they have directly
                    drawn us into the war. What that would have done to history I can't say, but it
                    certainly would have saved a lot of lives. That convinced me, at least, that
                    there was something valuable in maintaining contact with other people, even on a
                    casual basis, because a person who understands another person and his culture
                    probably won't shoot at him at some point later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that this was the spirit that was within USIA
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was my motivation for joining. Others had other reasons. USIA was a
                    kind of conglomerate of different kinds of people. There were bureaucrats and
                    adventurers, who having lived abroad, didn't want to come back to the US. There
                    were press people who were looking for something else to do. USIA at the time,
                    was really a mixed group. When I entered USIA, my first assignment was to Korea.
                    I had come to Washington with Japanese as my principal language claim. There was
                    a requirement of at least a minimal competence in a language before you got
                    promoted. So I was put into Japanese language training to get me off that
                    probation. In about three months, I got a 2 - 2 releasing me from the language
                    probation.</p>
                <p>There weren't any assignments available in Japan, so they put me in Korea. I knew
                    little about Korea but was interested in it and happy to go. It was a fine move;
                    I never objected to it at all. So I switched from Japanese grammar on a Friday
                    afternoon to elementary Korean on the next Monday morning. I had six months of
                    training before going to Seoul. At that time, Seoul was a different sort of
                    place for USIA. We made movies in Korea and had four branch posts which still
                    has the old “Mopix” vans as standard equipment. These were old Willys jeep
                    trucks with roof racks which could be used for mounting a 16mm projector for
                    outdoor movie shows. This past year those branches have all been closed, a sorry
                    testament to bean counters making what should have been thoughtful policy
                    decisions. Thus has the Foreign Service changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Kwangju, where I eventually became PAO, as well as Pusan, Taegu and Seoul.
                    It was an important program. Korea was a poor country; the people were much
                    poorer than those in Hokkaido that I knew in Japan, but hard working and tough.
                    There wasn't much in material wealth. The southern part of Korea is principally
                    agricultural. After a year in Seoul as a JOT, I was initially assigned to
                    Kwangju.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to do each chunk at a time. How did you find
                        studying Korean? You say you have trouble studying languages.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I was one of the older people in the class, having been to college for one
                    year, three years in the army and six years getting a four-year degree at Penn
                    and then going into graduate school after that. So I was getting on. I was in my
                    late '20s, but others in my class were younger. Language isn't easy at any age,
                    but it sure does get an awful lot more difficult as you progress down life's
                    path. Japanese was basically easy for me since I had lived in Japan and had
                    studied it at Penn. I got my 2,2 and got out of it. But when I switched to
                    Korean, it was back to zero again. Japanese helped a little bit, but even then,
                    Koreans didn't use Chinese characters very much. I had enjoyed Chinese
                    characters a lot. While I was in Chitose with the Army and not otherwise
                    teaching English in Sapporo, on my other off-duty-hours, I took some classes in
                    “sosho,” (grass) writing of Japanese characters in a special style. I learned a
                    lot about Japanese discipline, esthetics, and culture in those classes.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, Korean at the time was taught in Roman character equivalents. I
                    guess the theory was that thick-skulled Americans couldn't understand squiggly
                    little writing or something equally indefensible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually there are only 28 characters, so it is not that
                        big...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It is a syllabary, not an alphabet actually. It is grouped in these
                    clusters of syllables, so you get syllables forming words instead of the single
                    “kana” pronunciation in Japanese. It is more difficult. Phonetic values change,
                    based on their relationship to the following syllable, making it more
                    complicated to learn. At the time, Korean was, and still is I guess, considered
                    the most difficult language for an English-speaking person to learn. The reason
                    for that is, it has Chinese characters and a very complicated grammar. Someone
                    once told me there were 2,000 separate verb forms for each verb. Whether that is
                    true or not I don't know, but the multiplicity of verb forms is one aspect that
                    makes the language more difficult.</p>
                <p>For example, newspaper language is different from the spoken language, and within
                    the spoken language, there are different levels. If you are my classmate, I
                    speak to you one way. If you are one class ahead of me in school, I would have a
                    slightly different twist to my verb endings. At home, you speak to your child
                    one way; to your father, another way; your wife, a different way; and your
                    brother, in a fourth way. There are different levels of language. That doesn't
                    mean they are completely dissimilar, but there are enough differences so that
                    you can make errors very quickly. English-speaking missionaries who spent their
                    entire lives in Korea are famous as the butt of Korean jokes, because they would
                    make errors that sounded all right to foreigners but to Koreans gave rise to a
                    great deal of amusement. I don't know anyone who is not a native Korean who
                    really speaks Korean. Perhaps that is true for most difficult languages. You
                    have to limit your expectations when you begin such a study.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Bill Porter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with him or any feel for
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Not when I was in Seoul but when I was in Kwangju. Bill Porter was a very,
                    very smart and capable ambassador. He was intensely interested in Korea and
                    spoke Korean. He was interested enough in the process, so that when he ran his
                    embassy, he made sure he had all of us who were in the field - the Branch Public
                    Affairs Officers, a smattering of USAID people who were gradually being
                    withdrawn, and the Consular Officer who was in Pusan - come to Seoul every three
                    months for a de-briefing on what was going on in the provinces. It was nice for
                    a young officer to have that kind of serious attention from the boss.</p>
                <p>He would listen carefully and absorb what we had to say. He had very good
                    knowledge of what was going on in Korea. He was a good friend of Cardinal Kim,
                    who was one of the opposition people in Taegu. The ambassador had a
                    robin's-egg-blue carryall which you couldn't miss, since his was the only one
                    like it in Korea. He would take only his driver and suddenly leave Seoul, often
                    driving the carryall himself with his driver as passenger. No one knew where he
                    was going. If he wished, he would use the radiotelephone installed in the
                    carryall, but of course, could keep it off and be fully out of touch. This drove
                    the Korean security police crazy. The only reason I would know he was in Kwangju
                    was because his driver and my driver were old buddies for some reason or
                    other.</p>
                <p>Every time the ambassador would come to Kwangju, his driver would bring the
                    carryall to our American Center to park it. I would walk into the office in the
                    morning, see the bright blue carryall, and know the ambassador was in town.
                    Usually within an hour or so, I would receive a call from the local police,
                    saying they understood the ambassador was in town. I would respond that I
                    couldn't confirm or deny it. They would ask what he was doing. “He doesn't
                    confide in me,” I would say. “Where is he going?” “Well, I don't know.” “When is
                    he leaving?” “I don't know that either.” They couldn't approach him, because
                    that would be getting out of channels, but they wanted to make sure they knew
                    where he was, what he was up to, and, more importantly, who he was seeing. He
                    was a really nice, smart guy.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>On the other hand, he gave his political section a terrible time. When we got
                    finished with one of the field officer's quarterly briefings, we would leave his
                    office, only to be intercepted by the staff of the Political Section, anxious to
                    hear what was on the ambassador's mind. That would lead to our debrief for the
                    Political Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1968, how would you describe the political and economic
                        situation in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It was unrecognizable. I remember clearly my ride in from the Kimpo
                    airport on my arrival in Korea. I was met by the PAO (Public Affairs Officer),
                    Dan Moore. He picked me up in his nice black Chevy, or whatever it was. It was
                    dusk when I got in and very dark by the time I had processed through customs and
                    been received by Dan. We proceeded on the highway into the capital, and as we
                    got nearer and nearer to the center of the city, I noticed there weren't any
                    lights. It was pitch black. There were no cars. There was nothing. I was riding
                    in a void. I said, “Dan, what is this?” He said, “Well, at night time, it gets
                    pretty dark in Seoul, because there isn't much power.” And, sure enough, I
                    didn't see any light in Korea until we got almost to the Seoul railroad station
                    in the heart of Seoul. On the way in, near the U.S. Army's South Post compound,
                    there were a few light bulbs in windows, mostly stores. No street lights or
                    visible signs of people. I began to worry about what I was getting into.</p>
                <p>The next day, the streets were very busy. But Korea was very poor and
                    undeveloped. Of course, there was no subway, and I saw only a few, overcrowded
                    busses. It was very much an agrarian society and had suffered almost total
                    destruction in the Korean War. They were just beginning to pull themselves
                    together. A person going to Korea today would have no idea that it was so poor
                    such a short time ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I first saw Korea in 1952 as a GI in Seoul. There were no
                        trees, rugged hills.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Fifteen years later, there had been some rebuilding, although there was
                    only one major tourist hotel in the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the Political Section and in
                        briefings about the political situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Park Chung Hee was President and had been for more than five or six years.
                    He was in full control. It was very much a military society, although it wasn't
                    oppressive. The image of the Park Chung Hee government is a little bit distorted
                    in this country. He is remembered by some as a “tin horn” military dictator. I
                    don't think that ever was really the case.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I had spent my undergraduate work on East Asia and knew a little bit about Park
                    Chung Hee. I never met him, although I came close. We had set up an exhibit on
                    the Apollo landing on the moon and the related space program, and he was at the
                    opening. I did not meet him personally or even shake his hand. My only
                    impressions were from his passing close by. He was very short, with a crisp
                    military bearing. From my academic work on his life, I believe that he was
                    basically honest. He got that from the Japanese, because he was schooled in
                    their ethics of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in the Japanese army wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Not quite, he was in the Manchurian army which was run by the Japanese. I
                    know a fair amount about Park, because when I went back for an MA, I did my
                    thesis on him. I fault our intelligence services for not devoting the time and
                    energy to do a better job of looking at foreign leaders. It was always a source
                    of frustration to me that our senior leadership did not have the benefit of
                    careful biographic data on their counterparts. What I had seen was mostly the
                    most cursory impressions, much like what you read in news accounts. More
                    important is a better understanding of the elements of the training and
                    experience that serve as the foundation for attitude and prejudice.</p>
                <p>Park Chung Hee was a country boy, basically a teacher who was given a break by
                    the Japanese. His later biographies are not very good. He was recruited into the
                    Manchurian army. At that time, Manchukuo was a Japanese state in Manchuria. The
                    basis of the state, as the Japanese promoted it, was a gathering of the five
                    nations that comprised Manchuria. The problem for the Japanese was that in order
                    to sustain the image of a real nation of five nations, they had to have input
                    from all of the member groups, including Koreans. Park Chung Hee was picked as a
                    Korean who could be trusted. He was very good at martial arts.</p>
                <p>Evidently his martial arts teacher was Japanese, and saw something in Park that
                    they wanted. He went up to the military academy operated by the Japanese in
                    Harbin (the present day Changchun), graduated, and spent another two years in
                    Zama at the Japanese academy where he had more classes. He then went back to
                    Manchuria and became a lieutenant, fighting bandits in north China. When the
                    Japanese lost the war, Park Chung Hee somehow got himself to Beijing and was
                    then repatriated to Korea. He then went on the rocks for a while. Opposition
                    folk claim that he turned into a drunk and a wastrel, but I doubt that, given
                    his character. He was always fond of drink, even the otherwise lower class
                    Makkoli, a sort of rice beer. His brother was active in the communist movement
                    and Park Chung Hee was eventually arrested and was sentenced to death by
                    court.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would this have been under the Syngman Rhee
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes. He was sentenced to death for collusion with the enemy who were the
                    communists of the time. His brother died fighting some place (actually, he was
                    executed). Park Chung Hee had been known by a Japanese name during the period
                    when the Japanese had forced all Koreans to adopt Japanese names in an effort to
                    forcibly integrate Korea as a province of Japan. Chung Il Kwon, a general in the
                    new Korean army that emerged after the Second World War, had also been in the
                    Manchurian army. Like Park Chung Hee, he had served in the Manchukuo Army but
                    had studied for four full years at the Japanese Military Academy in Tokyo. He
                    pulled Park Chung Hee out of the fire by arranging an agreement for him to
                    cooperate. He allegedly turned over the names of everybody who was among the
                    conspirators on the communist side to save his neck. Again, that is a little bit
                    out of character, but possible. He became part of the civilian intelligence
                    apparatus of the Korean army and because of his Japanese military background, he
                    later entered the Korean military academy when the academy got underway. He was
                    in the fourth class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did he get his commission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I would have to look that up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this before the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, Park Chung Hee received his commission before the war. He served
                    during the war in a variety of jobs, essentially logistical. He was not good at
                    English but knew the Japanese manual of arms. When the Korean army was founded,
                    there was nothing to guide them on what to do, so strangely enough, they used
                    the Japanese manual of arms for their training. Park Chung Hee then worked his
                    way up the ranks. He didn't have a very good career, and he always seem to
                    struggle. He rose to the colonel level and then languished there. I lived in the
                    house where he once lived when he was head of the logistics command in Kwangju.
                    It was rumored that he was living in the house at a point sometime after the war
                    when the U.S. opened the American Cultural Center there. Since that house had
                    been Japanese property before the war, it became Korean government property
                    after the war and was among the sites made available to the U.S. for official
                    use for a minimal amount of rent each year. I often wonder how much resentment
                    of the Americans was instilled in the later President, since they expropriated
                    his residence and forced him to leave. That property remained the residence of
                    the BPAO (Branch Public Affairs Officer) up until the recent closing of the
                    center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you any idea of his role during the Korean War?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>YATES: No, I don't. I don't think he had one that had a command function where he
                    would have been mentioned in the history books. At that time, his function
                    appeared to be essentially support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One would think this was the defining time for anyone in
                        the Korean army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The first couple of classes at the academy contained the ones who were
                    very significant in the Korean conflict. He was behind that curve and was a
                    junior person at that time, so he didn't have a command. Secondly, he did not
                    particularly like Americans, and I think that attitude was demonstrated in the
                    following years. He didn't like the way Americans acted. He detested the Korean
                    generals who played golf and hobnobbed with the Americans, spoke English, and
                    generally lorded it over those like himself who were, as he saw himself I am
                    sure, good patriotic Koreans. His training in the Manchurian academy instilled
                    in him some very distinct social principles. The unity of the people; the
                    concept that if you are not for me, you are against me; the certainty of a rigid
                    social order along military lines. This shows up later in his work in the
                    “Saemaul Undong,” the New Community Movement that emerged in the latter part of
                    his administration. It was very similar to the kinds of things that were taught
                    at the Manchurian academy.</p>
                <p>However, he had a grasp of management, particularly in the way he used advisors.
                    Hahm Byon Chun, whom I knew in Seoul, a professor at the university at the time,
                    later became an advisor at the Blue House, an ambassador, and an important
                    influence on Park Chung Hee as president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Blue House is the equivalent to our White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That's right. The heart of the Korean government. Prof. Hahm once told me
                    that one of Park Chung Hee's strengths was the way he used his advisors. He read
                    incessantly, mainly Japanese newspapers, and was very well versed in what was
                    going on in the world. He would call advisors in regularly, but according to a
                    specific ritual. Prof. Hahm told me that when he would go in, Park Chung Hee
                    would ask specific questions, very carefully crafted questions, and never let on
                    what his opinions were. He would simply absorb information and then thank the
                    advisor very much. The next advisor would go in, and similar questions were
                    asked. After Park had heard all the evidence, he consolidated all the
                    information and made his decision. The advisors did not meet together and
                    present him with a consensus report. Often they did not know who else was being
                    consulted.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Park was able to maintain control for so long by using his advisors that way, and
                    because he learned from the Americans. He had learned American skills in
                    management in his duties as logistics officer in the Korean army. This was a
                    very smart man, but a man who had very clear prejudices, including feelings of
                    distance from Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to the embassy in 1968, and this was a new
                        country for you, what were you getting from your colleagues about the
                        government there? What was the feeling towards both the government of Park
                        Chung Hee and the situation in Korea at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Most Americans were uncomfortable with Park, as he was with them. He was
                    known as a dictator, having taken the government by force. He had become a
                    civilian and done things that appeased the people to a degree. I think most
                    people were focused on development at the time, though. It was the economic
                    development of Korea that was the main thrust, not the political situation.
                    Human rights were not a particularly popular thing in Korea, not an essential
                    issue when compared with the larger questions of economic development.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, women's affairs were a major element in our program efforts.
                    We had a lot of programming to involve women in the community. Consumer
                    protection was a big item. They got into a debate in USIA about where to draw
                    the line when helping this kind of process along to what we termed at the time
                    as “social engineering.” Were we making a conscious effort to change Korea, or
                    were we simply trying to help when people asked for assistance? That became
                    controversial. We made a special effort to reduce intrusiveness into the Korean
                    social situation, so we would avoid any possible future charge of “social
                    engineering.” That was not our business. Our business was to interpret America.
                    We were not there to promote consumer protection but to promote an understanding
                    of how Americans use consumer protection and make that knowledge available to
                    Korean women, particularly, leaders who were interested in developing this to a
                    greater extent in Korea; purity of food, the cleanliness of water, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have women's programs that came out of the can from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: This was something that we developed locally, because on our staff, we had
                    a very dynamic local employee who was interested in that and she dragged us
                    along. She subsequently became a very prominent woman leader in Korea and still
                    is. The last time I was there, I saw her on television several times on expert
                    panels, etc. She was a very good example of how an FSN (Foreign Service
                    National) employee really can become a dynamic force in her own society.</p>

                <p>YATES: Lee Chung Sook, I believe.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling you were getting from your colleagues
                        about the threat from the North?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The threat was palpable. I remember a reception, one of the first official
                    functions I attended in Seoul, when we were all talking and suddenly we hear
                    “boom!, boom!.” The sounds were obviously not caused by firecrackers but heavy
                    artillery. The entire room froze, and we wondered if this was the beginning of
                    the war again. It turned out to be only South Korean army maneuvers, but the
                    tension was always close to the surface in Seoul, only about 30 miles from the
                    DMZ.</p>
                <p>That is still the case. Just this past year when I was in Seoul, they had a
                    celebration in town where they set off loud fireworks. You heard “boom” and the
                    same question pops up after all these years. There is a constant threat. Thirty
                    miles away, there is the sixth largest army in the world, poised to strike and
                    threatening to do so. They have lived under this threat for 40 years. It is
                    quite a psychological burden.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, and they still do, sometimes observed more in the breach than in
                    practice. Perhaps this relates to the general attitude of the younger people who
                    did not experience the horror of the Korean War.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Oh, sure. But what I was relating was not part of these drills. I am
                    commenting on it in terms of the psychology of the people at the time. We had a
                    person on our staff who said he still, after all those years following the
                    Korean War, had nightmares. His nightmare was always the same. He was hiding
                    under the floorboards of his house and above him were North Korean troops
                    looking for him. He would wake up in a sweat every time. There is still that
                    kind of psychology.</p>

                <p>YATES: No, never to my knowledge. In Kwangju, I knew some of the missionaries
                    there, although not very well. All my dental work was done by an American dental
                    missionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seven Day Adventist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: No, he was a Baptist, I think. They were medical missionaries and didn't
                    do much preaching. He was there to teach Koreans how to do good dentistry, and
                    he did a good job. I still have some of the caps he put on. I did a lot of work
                    there with him. He was a very fine man. But no, the medical missionaries had
                    nothing to do with us, and we wouldn't have anything to do with them on a
                    professional level in the work we were engaged in.</p>
                <p>However, we had a bigger problem with Peace Corps volunteers, as at that time,
                    young dynamic Americans were very anti-government because of the Vietnam war.
                    They were quick to accuse. Some Peace Corps volunteers were telling their Korean
                    hosts that those USIA people were really CIA. That was a hard thing for us to
                    deal with in Korea, because Koreans are very easily convinced of conspiracies
                    and because the volunteers living with them every day had developed a strong
                    sense of confidence and trust. The Peace Corps Volunteers' views simply
                    confirmed for their Korean hosts what they always suspected. We really had to
                    “talk turkey” to some of these Peace Corps Volunteers who were doing us severe
                    harm in the rural areas of Korea and in the cities where they taught
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what was USIA trying to do? One
                        thing was to explain the United States, but beyond that, there was pushing
                        American policy and a high priority on that was Vietnam and our involvement
                        there. What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Vietnam was never a problem for us in Korea. Remember Koreans were part of
                    our effort in Vietnam. They gave it their full support. They had experienced,
                    first hand, the perfidy and atrocities of the communist armies and needed no
                    convincing to give our efforts in Vietnam full support. In fact, the White Horse
                    Division of the Korean Army that went to Vietnam while I was in Korea, was
                    famous for its effectiveness with the Vietnamese.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>There is a story that after they arrived they were attacked by a North Vietnamese
                    contingent, and the Koreans captured a number of them. In order to hold the
                    prisoners without an extra amount of manpower, they took copper wire and a big
                    needle and strung them together through their checks with this copper wire like
                    a string of fish and put a Korean soldier on one end with the wire in his hand.
                    In that manner, one soldier could control a very large number of North
                    Vietnamese prisoners. In our Army, a GI would be run out of the service for
                    doing this. However, the word got around among the Viet Cong that these were not
                    Western, long-nose types with all these fancy ideas about human rights; these
                    were Asians with a different view. So the Viet Cong soon learned not to engage
                    the Koreans in battle, since the consequences could be severe.</p>
                <p>With the ensuing and rapid pacification of their area, the Koreans became quickly
                    bored with their Vietnam experience and would spend their time shopping to the
                    PX to buy television sets and other inexpensive consumer goods to take home with
                    them at the end of their tours. The North Vietnamese scrupulously avoided
                    contact with the Korean troops.</p>
                <p>There was a Korean military academy in Kwangju, and when I was there, we used to
                    watch them come through the city while in training. They would double time
                    twenty miles to the exercise grounds and double time twenty miles back after a
                    whole day of training. You would see them running through the streets and there
                    wasn't an ounce of fat on them. They were very, very tough. This is what the
                    North Vietnamese were running up against in the war there. I can understand why
                    they didn't want any part of the Korean forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The mission had a variety of aspects to it. The major one was to interpret
                    American policy. For example, towards the end of my tour in Kwangju, Nixon
                    visited China, and the Koreans were absolutely convinced that Nixon had sold
                    them down the river. The Shanghai Communique was the only thing we could point
                    to with clarity to convince them we had not. Videotape was a big part of my
                    program and was key to the solution of this special issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>We copied off-air from Japanese television a tape of the Nixon-Zhou En-lai
                    toasts, the banquet, and the speeches and translated them doing a voice-over. I
                    had a transportable video unit consisting of videotape recorder, a transformer,
                    and a television set. One of my local employees, a driver, and I would show this
                    video at every possible university, business club, school, civic organization,
                    governmental organization, and anybody else I could find, if I could gather
                    three or four in a room together to see that tape. This was to discredit the
                    Korean government's version of what we were doing in China. That was direct
                    support of policy and was one of those rare instances in USIA where we had a
                    clear and unambiguous problem on policy that we could do something with. After
                    about two weeks of very intensive programming around the country, we essentially
                    discredited the Korean government's persistent claim that the U.S. government
                    had ignored Korea and was making secret agreements with the Chinese about policy
                    on the Korean peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a direct collision with the Korean government,
                        saying these Americans had sold us out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. At that time, the Korean press was essentially a handmaiden of the
                    government. We were getting hit by editorials, by political opinion columns, and
                    by slanted news coverage saying, “Aha! The Americans are double dealing us and
                    ignoring our interests to their own advantage.” They really were not. I saw
                    governors and mayors and went to the Korean CIA headquarters once, showing these
                    tapes that showed the real story. And it worked. It was a countrywide effort
                    with all the branches involved. We hit them with everything we had and were very
                    effective, I think, in getting Korean opinion turned around. However, the Korean
                    government was still uneasy with what we had done. I suspect it was Park Chung
                    Hee, himself, who was really ticked off.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One talks in Japanese terms about the Nixon “shokku”. How
                        did the opening of China go down when word came out that Henry Kissinger had

                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was what I was talking about. That was a shock. The Koreans weren't
                    involved and didn't know about it. It was as much a surprise to them as it was
                    to everybody else. The shokku that occurred in Tokyo had reverberations in Seoul
                    as well. But what we had to do was, quickly and without any kind of hesitation,
                    put out information on exactly what had happened; that was effective. The
                    repercussions of the disinformation from the Korean government did not last very
                    long. I don't know what happened in Japan.</p>

                <p>YATES: This was my best tour ever in the Foreign Service. It turned out that the
                    AID (Agency for International Development) people were pulling out as I arrived,
                    so I was the only American official left in the two southwestern provinces of

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Kwangju was in the agrarian part of South Korea. A major rice producer,
                    rape seed, sesame, and that kind of stuff. Basic Korean food items. There also
                    was good fishing off the coast. I had two provinces, Cholla Namdo (South Cholla)
                    and Cholla Pukdo (North Cholla). We had a fairly large American military base at
                    Kunsan in Cholla Pukdo (it is still there) and a contingency base in Kwangju
                    with a full Colonel as its commander. It was there in case there were a war when
                    it would become a rear area landing base and logistics transfer point. It had
                    the POL on hand...</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Right. On hand in case it was needed for actual combat. So the Kwangju Air
                    Force base was essentially a ROK air force base, or Republic of Korea air force
                    base which would also serve as a contingency base for American forces, should we
                    have to move them in. I think that contingency is still present, although the
                    American forces no longer reside. There must have been about 200 Americans at
                    the time I was in Kwangju as BPAO.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the outlook.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Absolutely. Kwangju is traditionally the opposition capital of Korea.
                    Korea historically was divided into three parts. Korguryo in the north, the
                    hunters and gatherers, as it were, and Paekche and Silla which are the two
                    southern principal kingdoms during the highpoint in Korean culture. The region
                    containing the Cholla provinces was called the kingdom of Paekche. Paekche had
                    close ties to Japan and was considered a cultural capital of the larger Korean
                    society. It also had ties to China. If you look at a map, you will see how close
                    the Shantung Peninsula of China is to the Korean coast.</p>
                <p>The southern part of Korea was especially affected by China, for some reason.
                    When I traveled in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, the language there
                    sounded like Korean, but of course wasn't; it was Cantonese. The Paekche and
                    Silla people did not get along. At the time I was in Kwangju, there was a sign
                    above a tunnel that goes through the Chiri mountain range which divided Honam
                    (Cholla Namdo and Cholla Pukdo), the old Paekche, from the Kyongsando region
                    (originally the Silla kingdom) that says, “This is where the language
                    changes.”</p>
                <p>The language, of course, is all Korean, and the nation is supposed to be the most
                    homogenous country in the world, but there are a lot of differences there. There
                    is the difference in attitude and language among other things. The Honam
                    provinces of the southwest provinces traditionally have felt discriminated
                    against. They spoke a dialect which was not standard. The Kwangju revolt of 1918
                    was one of the first civil revolts against the Japanese. The Tonghak rebellion
                    found its roots in Kwangju and the Silla area. The most prominent people of the
                    opposition today are from the southern area, including Kim Dae Jung who is from
                    Mokpo, the port city southwest of Kwangju.</p>
                <p>While I was there, they built the first four lane limited access highway from
                    Seoul to Pusan. It ran through Taegu, which is in the Kyongsando region. It came
                    down through areas outside of the Honam region. Therefore, much of the intense
                    industrial development of the time occurred on the east coast of Korea because
                    of this new highway. This was much to the chagrin of the people in the Honam
                    region who felt they were being ignored. They finally put through a double lane
                    “limited access” highway down to Kwangju and then over to Pusan. When I first
                    arrived, all roads outside of Kwangju and a couple of the other larger cities of
                    the region were gravel, unimproved gravel. I spent lots of time on the road
                    between Chonju, the capital of Cholla Pukdo, and Kwangju, where I lived.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes, I married a girl from Kwangju. For several semesters, I taught
                    American Studies at Chosun University where my wife studied and at Chonnam
                    University, the national university in Cholla Namdo. She was not a part of my
                    classes.</p>
                <p>The two classes I taught were particularly interesting, to me at least. I was
                    asked to teach by American studies professors, because they wanted to have their
                    students get a little bit of the feeling of how American classes are taught.
                    They didn't feel comfortable in that effort, so I agreed to teach a couple of
                    semesters in each school. According to school rules, I would have to be paid for
                    it. However, being a government employee, the money I earned went into a
                    scholarship fund for students at each school.</p>
                <p>I had an assistant teacher, particularly since the classes were in English. I
                    taught about what kind of country this is, the geography, the economy, etc. It
                    was kind of fun, because I was able to experiment with the teaching environment
                    that the Korean students were accustomed to. In the normal Korean classroom, on
                    the entry of the professor or instructor, the class would stand up. The class
                    monitor would then report the class attendance to the instructor, who would then
                    move to the front of the room where there was a podium and deliver a lecture for
                    almost exactly fifty minutes. At the end of the lecture, he would close his book
                    and leave. That was the way Korean classes worked. The procedure was to take
                    notes and then be examined on the information given in the lectures. There was
                    very little outside reading or individual research by students.</p>
                <p>I decided that instead of that essentially Confucian relationship between
                    instructor and students, we would do it straight American style. When I would
                    enter the classroom and the class would stand up, I would ask them to sit down.
                    I wouldn't stand in front or take an attendance report. They were told if they
                    did not attend, it would be all right with me, but that I could not be sure that
                    they would do well on the exams. I would walk around the room, write on the
                    blackboard, ask them questions from the back of the room, assign reading, try to
                    get others than the class leader to respond in class, and generally caused great
                    consternation.</p>
                <p>One of the most difficult shocks for the classes was the habit of asking
                    questions of the students who were not class monitors. Just about always, the
                    class monitors would answer the questions. The reason for that was that in the
                    traditional system, the students did not respond to questions from the
                    instructor since the teacher was the font of all wisdom and it was the student's
                    duty to absorb the teachings that were offered. How could a teacher question the
                    students? They did not have the knowledge unless first imparted by the teacher,
                    who assuredly already knew the answers. Tests were written exams at the end of
                    the course. Thinking independently was not required, even discouraged.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>If I had the brashness to ask a student a question directly, I would be told
                    politely to ask the monitor who speaks for the class. This direct interrogation
                    on the material, of course, was to indicate who had completed the assigned
                    reading, but always came as a shock to those who were unaccustomed to speaking
                    up. This was particularly true for the girls, who were always quiet. Yet this
                    was to be taught in the American mode, so I persisted.</p>
                <p>I also assigned reading, which caused some concern among the inferior students,
                    who certainly did not want such assignments. Professors always rehearsed to the
                    classes what was going to be on the exams, so reading on one's own outside of
                    class was a waste of time. To make matters worse, I assigned reading out of a
                    text book which I laboriously xeroxed and passed out. Some students did the
                    extra reading, catching the wave as it were, to learn a bit about the “American
                    way.” Some even tried to respond, albeit shyly and hesitantly, to my questions.
                    Rarely would anyone ask questions, so I would press, “Okay, who has a question?”
                    All that usually prompted was staring at the floor.</p>
                <p>I remember my first math class in Clarkson. With a brand new syllabus, the
                    instructor walked into the room and put his book down on the table, saying, “You
                    were all assigned reading for this first class. I assume you have all read it.
                    Are there any questions?” There was no response. He continued, “Okay, I guess
                    everyone knows what is required for tonight, I will see you tomorrow” and took
                    his book and walked off. That was the end of the class. I didn't go to that
                    extreme in my lectures in Kwangju, but I did walk into the class and said,
                    “Okay, now, you have all read the assignment, what do you think about it?” That
                    caused enormous stress for the students.</p>
                <p>I couldn't push it too far, but it was fun to do. I said that at the end of the
                    class there was going to be an exam like they had in their other courses, so
                    they understood that. But I also asked them to do a paper. They asked what was a
                    paper? I said that you go out and do some research. You pick a topic, go to the
                    library, find materials, read about it, think, and give me three or four pages
                    in a paper. The language of the paper could be in Korean. It did not have to be
                    in English. I told them if they produced a paper, they would automatically get a
                    one letter increase in their grade, regardless of the quality of the paper.
                    Therefore if a student got a B on the exam, he or she would get an A in the
                    course. Well, that went down heavy. I got some questions, but I didn't get even
                    one paper. I tried and tried to get them to write.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>A couple of the smarter students in the class came to me at the American Center,
                    which I ran, and said, “What do I do?” I would say, “Read books or magazines if
                    you want and find a topic”. “What topic?” “You pick something that interests
                    you.” It was hard for them to understand that they had to think independently,
                    which, of course, was the purpose of the exercise. A few students made an effort
                    to get started, but to my knowledge, nobody ever finished a paper. This was
                    Korea in 1972, but all is different now. American techniques are more prevalent,
                    particularly in the courses taught by professors who have received advanced
                    degrees in the US. I would suppose that the students still feel uncomfortable
                    with the system, since the high schools remain more closely identified with the
                    traditional way of teaching. The “American way” of challenging the students with
                    a professor who is more a guide to an investigation of a subject than an expert
                    whose knowledge is only to be emulated and repeated in the exam. That is the
                    Confucian tradition most commonly accepted throughout Asia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you follow any of these students who would go to
                        graduate school in the United States, or would any of them do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: We did know that Korean students going to the United States had desperate
                    troubles. I knew some of them in Philadelphia when I was there. The bank I
                    worked at hired a student going to Temple University, and he was having
                    desperate troubles. He could hardly speak English. There was an occasional
                    suicide of a Korean student who just got too far behind and couldn't manage. A
                    student going abroad to study from Korea was considered the best, the cream of
                    the crop, and the families usually sold the cow, as it were, to get them to go
                    and put a lot of pride and energy, money, and resources into these students.
                    When they got to the United States, they couldn't survive because of the
                    difference in the educational systems. So rather than go home in shame as a
                    failure, some simply remained in the U.S. and others even resorted to
                    suicide.</p>
                <p>It was hard on the students and on the schools. The instructors at these two
                    schools understood that there was trouble. One of the purposes of my class was
                    to give an inkling of the kind of experience they would have in an American
                    university. Whether it worked or not, I can't say, and I have not tried to see
                    if any of my struggling students ever made it to the U.S. for study. I would
                    think not, simply because one course in an American style of teaching is
                    insufficient to become really sensitized to a method which is so alien to the
                    practices of the time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think so, because I recall one of the young women
                        in my file room came to me and wanted some advice. Her brother was going to
                        go abroad to school, he was an engineer, and she wanted to know which ones
                        he should apply to for scholarships. One school was called MIT and the other
                        was Cal Tech. I said that they were the two top schools in the United
                        States, probably in the world, so either one would be fine. I was impressed,
                        because I had run consular sections in other parts of the world where the
                        students were often going to what I would call rinky-dink colleges which
                        were designed really to take money from foreigners. But these were first
                        rate. But it was in the sciences.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The Korean system of education, as with Asian educational systems which
                    use rote memorization in general, is more attuned to the kind of mathematical
                    proofs and memorization that is necessary in order to be successful in the
                    sciences. Many don't know English, but your skills are as good in Korean as in
                    English when mathematics is concerned. You don't need a lot of language. There
                    is a special international argot, anyway, to the discipline that you probably
                    will pick up in your country. But when you get into reading historical
                    treatises, expressing opinion, doing original research on a topic, those methods
                    were not common in Korea. The Korean system was not to take a Korean student and
                    show him or her how to learn. It was to teach the student what he or she should
                    know, and when they became professors, they would take that knowledge and expand
                    it more. They would have to learn the fundamentals from their predecessors
                    first.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Asian tradition of instruction also had good points that are too
                    often overlooked in the West. For example, when I was in Kwangju, I had a good
                    friend, Huh Baek Nyun, whose pen name was Yi Jae. He was an artist, a living
                    national treasure of Korea. He produced magnificent work based on classical
                    Chinese Southern Sung Dynasty principles of art. I would chat with him
                    occasionally in his studio and once in a while, would take a new book on
                    American art. He had long fingernails and would turn the pages very slowly. He
                    would stop and look longer at a particular example, and you could tell he felt
                    that particular picture was good, and usually it was. He had a very fine
                    eye.</p>
                <p>He was running an art school and had two sons. The younger son was a doctor and
                    the older was with him to be trained by his father. I asked him how his students
                    were? “Oh,” he said, “they are not very good.” “Why not, no talent?” “They are
                    too impatient,” he offered. “Young people don't understand. They think that you
                    can take a brush and make art. They are wrong. It takes seven years to learn how
                    to make a straight line with the brush. Seven years how to make a dot. After you
                    have learned those two crafts, then you can learn how to make clouds that flow
                    through the mountains, and that is another seven years. So after you know how to
                    make a straight line, and after you know how to make a dot, and after you know
                    how to make the clouds that run through the mountains, then you can begin to
                    create art.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Twenty-one years later!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That's right. What he was dramatically putting into perspective was that
                    you have to learn the craft, and until you have it mastered, you cannot produce
                    art. I have always taken that to heart, because I think that is a fundamental
                    Asian view of things. A student goes to a master, sits at the feet of the
                    master, and maybe in 20 or 30 years after studying with the master and mastering
                    the craft, can then begin to create his own interpretation. Even then, he is
                    still looking back at what has been done and principally repeating what he has
                    been taught and learned at the feet of the master, before he, himself, could
                    become a master. He doesn't even have the privilege of becoming a master until
                    the very last days of his life. Sort of the upside down from the way we look at
                    it now, with the idea that youth can carry the day and bring new ideas into
                    things and create something superior to the old. That concept of endless
                    progress is not an Asian concept. I think he had a point which showed in his
                    criticism of the American art he saw in the books I would bring to him. He said
                    that some of it showed promise while other examples were just junk and
                    untutored. Until you have the skills, regardless of how good you are, it is not
                    going to come out well. That was his important lesson of life.</p>

                        or dissent and were American ideas being used by the youth to see how to
                        oppose the government? We certainly were in the period of great dissent in
                        the United Statesthe anti-Vietnam feelings, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It was clearly a center of dissent. They felt wronged and not a part of
                    the major stream of things going on in South Korea. Kwangju is also the most
                    conservative part of the country, being agrarian. Conservative in the sense of
                    looking back to the old and unwilling to give up the traditional. If you have a
                    chance to see a portrayal of Korean culture such as the farmers' dances, that is
                    all stuff that comes out of the south. It is the farmer based agrarian culture,
                    which is at the heart of the Korean traditional culture.</p>
                <p>The bureaucracy is in Seoul. That is where the later Yi Dynasty kings sat and was
                    the administrative seat under the Japanese. But the real folk culture is in the
                    south. You don't have a large bubble of pressure down there of modern change.
                    You find a grudging non-acceptance of the bureaucrats up in Seoul running around
                    in their fancy cars and playing golf while the folk of Honam suffered down on
                    the farm, but they kept the traditional values. The Kwangju student revolt in
                    1980, of course, got out of hand and led to the later scandal and terrible
                    trauma within the country. The students were unhappy. That doesn't mean they
                    were unhappy in the sense that they could be seen as becoming Jeffersonian
                    democrats. Students in Korea, I would argue, don't trust the older generation,
                    but the result of their advocacy is not necessarily what we would see as
                    one-man-one-vote. They have a more obscure reason for rebelling, mainly because
                    I think they feel that certain groups in the society have an unfair advantage,
                    so they see themselves as being left out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I got some years later was that Park Chung Hee had
                        made a very wise decision, sort of social engineering, in that he was not
                        going to make the mistake so many dictators do and that is milk the farm of
                        everything in order to make bread or rice cheap in the capital city. He was
                        going to make sure that the farmers were receiving basically fair pay for
                        what they were producing. Was this true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I think that is a fair statement. Park Chung Hee was a product of a rural
                    environment. His father was a middle level bureaucrat, but the former President
                    was a small town boy who probably felt some of the traditional resentment of a
                    villager against those sophisticated from the city. However, he was a great
                    reader and that was one of his principal strengths. He read about other strong,
                    authoritative leaders. Kemal Ataturk of Turkey was one of his idols, a strong
                    leader. Nasser was also someone he had a favorable opinion of. There was also
                    talk about de Gaulle as being among his pantheon, but that was less clear. I
                    think it was unquestionable that he had a great deal of respect for Kemal
                    Ataturk. Those are people who had agrarian reforms in their basic programs.</p>
                <p>Park Chung Hee spent a lot of time on farm issues. He saw himself as a farm boy,
                    and I think he understood, as Mao Zedong did in China, that the fundamental part
                    of the country is agrarian. Of course, possibly owing to that prejudice, the
                    industrial worker didn't do too well. Korean labor was generally underpaid for a
                    long time and essentially was the way Korea made its economic leaps forward.
                    There were vertically organized monopolies in Korea, the Chaebol, that dominated
                    the country for a long time.</p>
                <p>The Koreans are basically tough people. They have had a difficult history, having
                    been walked on by the Chinese and Japanese and had to tough it out all along.
                    Americans appeared on the scene after the defeat of the Japanese and became a
                    presence in their society but were not going to be there permanently. Koreans
                    expect the departure of the Americans will come at some point, although they
                    don't want it right now. President Carter was going to pull us out, but the
                    Koreans got upset about that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was there at the time and it was a difficult timeYankee,
                        don't go home just now!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>YATES: An unusual message. The Koreans are not only tough but reluctantly
                    understand to varying degrees that a lot of their chestnuts were pulled out of
                    the fire because of the American willingness to fight against the communist
                    North. Younger Koreans forget that, they don't learn much of their own history,
                    particularly history starting with the Japanese occupation. Psychologically they
                    want to forget that period of subjugation. It was an embarrassment and a
                    terrible time that they would like to see go away. Iceland has the same feeling
                    about the Danes and won't even talk about them because they were in control and
                    that was an embarrassing period in their history. So the Koreans are reluctant
                    to think much about the Japanese occupation period.</p>
                <p>They don't like the Japanese for the suffering they received at the hands of
                    their overlords for almost half a century and will continue to dislike the
                    Japanese for the foreseeable future. In this, they are somewhat like the
                    Chinese. The Japanese haven't quite got a clear understanding that such a
                    feeling persists to the extent that it does, but none the less, that is the way
                    Koreans feel. So they are missing an important part of their recent history, a
                    basic part of their formative years as a modern nation.</p>
                <p>Most Koreans blame the U.S. for the division of the peninsula. We ran into this
                    all the time. Many think that the U.S. has a responsibility to put it back
                    together again. That question is open to argument based on the post-WWII
                    negotiations that began in Yalta, but I feel that is basically a false reading
                    of history. The naked truth would reveal that nobody thought about it. Perhaps,
                    that is an even worse insult: that nobody bothered to give serious consideration
                    to Korea; it was an after-thought.</p>
                <p>With the Japanese surrender, the American military was very reluctant to get
                    involved in Korea. General Hodge was in the Philippines at the time and was
                    deeply reluctant to accept the direct order to go to Korea. Americans knew
                    little about Korea, and apart from a few missionaries, we had almost no
                    expertise in the language or culture. In our post-war innocence, we had much to
                    learn about the complexities of the responsibilities we inherited with the
                    victory in the Pacific. Hodge rounded up as many experts, mostly missionaries,
                    as he could find, and flew to Kimpo to receive the surrender from the Japanese
                    who were fearful of having to surrender to their long-time rivals, the Russians.
                    The story of that decision, to get to Seoul in response to pleas from the
                    defeated Japanese, is one of the interesting side lights of the end of the war.
                    Evidently the basic decision was made in the White House, with a few relatively
                    junior policy makers and military (Dean Rusk, Marshall Green...) carrying the
                    day.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I don't know whether that was a hurried and ill-considered decision or not, but
                    had we demurred, it is likely that all of Korea would be communist today.
                    Mistake or fortune, we were ignorant of Korea and its problems and really did
                    not want to get involved. There was an effort in 1948 to unify the country with
                    a UN vote, but the North pulled out of it. I don't think too many tears were
                    shed in the South when the North pulled out. Korea is not a unified country,
                    despite all the propaganda which says it is the most homogenous people in the
                    world. They have very deep, historic antagonisms. The Paekche/Silla thing is
                    only part of it. The Northerners have always been Northerners.</p>
                <p>The split is something similar to divisions in the U.S. between the Yankees and
                    the Dixiecrats. There is a split there, and it is going to take a couple hundred
                    years for things to cool off. The Korean War didn't help it any. If we had
                    fought the Civil War four or five years ago, maybe we would be able to
                    understand the emotional scars more clearly today. I do not believe that the
                    Koreans themselves fully understand these emotions, but they have this emotional
                    thing in their stomachyes, we must be united, we are all one nation, but not
                    today. During most of the divided period, it was forbidden to teach about or
                    study the North. Collections of materials about the North were kept under lock
                    and key, and anyone attempting to learn about the North was subject to severe
                    penalties under the National Security Law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any discussion while you were there of what
                        would happen with unification?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Not in the way it would be discussed today. In those days it was
                    inconceivable because of their economies. The current discussion is that
                    communism is dead, even in the North, and they are no longer the threat they
                    were earlier. Certainly there remains an unambiguous military threat because of
                    the enormous size of the North Korean military, almost three quarters of which
                    is poised near the DMZ, ready to strike without warning. Yet there is no doubt
                    that Southerners do not have the same fear of the ideology of communism eroding
                    social stability there. That was not the case at the time I was in Kwangju.</p>
                <p>At that time, there was a real fear of infiltration from the North of spies and
                    saboteurs. There was an incident while I was there where somebody walked into a
                    village and asked for a bank that had been in the town during the Japanese
                    occupation. Villagers suspected that he was a former villager who had gone north
                    and had recently been infiltrated back into the south. They shot and killed him.
                    He was an outsider, but turned out to be just a guy who had moved to Japan and
                    had come back looking for his old boyhood home. Unfortunately, he did not
                    explain, nobody knew him, and he was taken as a spy. That illustrates the
                    intensity of the feeling and the sense of insecurity at that time. Nonetheless,
                    he should have known better than to mess around and not let people know who he
                    was. He was a casualty of the nerves of an era. I do not think a similar
                    incident would happen today, although we are not so many months past the
                    submarine incident where Northerners successfully infiltrated into the South and
                    were caught only when their submarine became beached on the southern coast.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: No, the word wasn't even spoken. Communists couldn't operate. If anybody
                    was even charged as a leftist, they would lose their career and family and be
                    ostracized. The commotion over the real or imagined leanings of opposition

                </p>
                <p>YATES: After the spring semester was over, students would come down to Kwangju,
                    where they sometimes would stir up trouble. We had demonstrations; we had
                    threats. I was there during martial law. Park Chung Hee in 1971, I guess it was,
                    declared martial law. I was in Chonju at a restaurant with several college
                    professors, including several law professors, when somebody came in and said
                    everybody had to go home quickly, because martial law had been declared. The
                    shock of the Koreans I was with was immediate and deeply felt. Q: What was the
                    cause of the martial law?</p>
                <p>YATES: I don't recall the immediate cause. They felt things were getting out of
                    control and decided to put a lid on and ban all assembly. If four or more people
                    found themselves together on the same street corner, they could be arrested,
                    even though they may not have had any sort of ulterior motives. In the American
                    Center, we had a problem with our programs, since the authorities had insisted
                    that we cease holding meetings. However, in consultation with the embassy in
                    Seoul, we concluded that, as Americans, we had a legal and moral right to
                    continue our calendar of programming. That unwanted decision was communicated to
                    the local authorities, with the invitation to the officials that they were
                    welcome to attend as well, if they wished.</p>
                <p>That caused great strain. Things got fairly tense. The Korean CIA had taken to
                    posting their agents in the front of our American Center where their purpose was
                    obviously to intimidate our library and program patrons. They would stand
                    outside our door, taking names and attempting to stop people from coming in.
                    Every day we had to clean up a circle of cigarette butts left in the spot where
                    a sequence of chain-smoking goons had been posted. Yet our attendance did not
                    fall off appreciably, for our clientele was a hardy lot of independent-minded
                    natives of Honam. Nevertheless, I was greatly irritated by the official action
                    of one of our close allies, and with Seoul's, concurrence had to take one of my
                    staff people, who was very reluctant to the point of outright fear, out to the
                    Korean CIA headquarters in the western part of the city to tell them to back
                    off.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>We went to the Korean CIA headquarters in Kwangju, which was located in a
                    secluded area. My staff said there was a snake pit in there where they threw
                    people they didn't like, so they were most reluctant to go. I assembled my
                    driver and Mr. Oh Hyung, my senior staff assistant, and said we were going to go
                    along with our videotape recorder, so that we might show a sample of our
                    programming and make the request for them to desist. I called the KCIA
                    headquarters in advance with the request for a meeting, and they said all right.
                    So I went out and saw the local KCIA chief.</p>
                <p>We showed him the videotape and left some pamphlets and told him we would be
                    happy to see him at our center any time for a discussion. Of course, we knew he
                    never would come. After the simple demarche, his people still hung around, and
                    the ring of cigarette butts continually marked where they had stood. Yet they
                    did get off our backs, and USIS policy in Korea continued to be that we would
                    not stop programming or change anything because of the dictates of martial law.
                    It did not pertain to us. And people came. We had better attendance then than we
                    ever had. The lesson to the Korean government was clear. We could be as stubborn
                    as they were and would not be pushed around. So on balance, the insistence to
                    continue programming as usual was a good move.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in trying to explain the American
                        protest movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It was red hot at that time in the U.S. but not in Korea. Koreans in
                    general didn't understand the student movement in the US. They generally
                    supported what we did in Vietnam, because we had done it in Korea and they had
                    benefitted greatly by it. So there wasn't a great intellectual uncertainty about
                    our actions. The Korean Government sent troops, and their people generally
                    agreed with that. There was a lot of television coverage about their own troops
                    in Vietnam. I don't believe that even today, they question our involvement in
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Our programming on protest in America interpreted American society more in terms
                    of how the American democracy works, and when there is protest in the US, what
                    it really means. Is it like the Korean demonstration in the street or is it
                    something else? One of the things that we did at the time was to try to
                    interpret American mores and policies to those who were likely to become future
                    leaders. I mentioned before the Kwangju 2nd Military Academy. There were about
                    2000 students there at the time. We made an arrangement wherein American Studies
                    classes were held for the student body. I contracted with local professors from
                    schools and colleges, who were competent in American studies in a variety of
                    fields...literature, economics, history, etc. I went out to the Academy and
                    offered to do a program for the cadets. I offered to pay the freight to bring in
                    these professors to do a lecture program on American studies for the cadets.
                    They were enthusiastic and agreed to make arrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>While I had expected small classes of a selection of cadets who had a special
                    interest in American subjects, I was unprepared for the result. They put all two
                    thousand cadets into the auditorium, all shaved head rows, not a hair in the
                    place. You walked in and two thousand people stood up and saluted and shouted a
                    military greeting. It was quite a sensation. You walked up and they had spot
                    lights, recorders, new chalk, and erasers on the blackboard. They had cadre
                    standing at the back with long bamboo poles. If a head went down, a bamboo pole
                    would whack it. This was to make sure no one fell asleep. Certainly, one would
                    not want to fall asleep at a Korean military academy.</p>
                <p>I took a couple of professors with me for the opening session. I gave a short
                    welcoming statement and then turned it over to them and left for the classes to
                    be conducted entirely in Korean. The concept of the series worked out quite
                    well. The professors I hired did not all have appropriate American Studies
                    lectures in the courses they taught in their respective universities. Therefore,
                    they had to do special work to prepare for the event. They would come to my
                    library to do research, an important objective for our library in the first
                    place. I paid them for the lectures, but they would have to do all the
                    preparations. I selected the topic, and they would have to gather the materials
                    and get up to speed for the lecture.</p>
                <p>Thereby, I got double value for my dollar because, being good academics, they
                    would naturally not want to spend all that effort for just one lecture. After
                    delivering a lecture at the academy, they would use the same prepared notes in
                    classes for their own students. I had about 15 people from different colleges
                    and universities do these lectures.</p>
                <p>I had one professor come to me at my office after he had delivered his lecture
                    out at the Military Academy, and he was very pale. I asked him what was the
                    matter. He said, “I have just come from the military academy.” “How did it go?”
                    He said, “I have taught for 20 years and have never, never taught two thousand
                    people at one time. I am just blown away by that. My nerves are shot and my
                    whole substance is all gone... two thousand people listening to me?” It was
                    really quite an experience for them. It was a great program. We did two
                    semesters out there.</p>
                <p>We also did a lot of videotape programs. This was when videotape was new. We had
                    3/4 inch videotape. We were taping USIA produced material in Korean - our own
                    motion picture unit did the conversion for us - and took them into Rotary clubs,
                    schools, government offices, businesses, anywhere that we could gather together
                    a few people who were prominent in the community. At the time, television was
                    brand new in Korea. I had a heavy, but small 12” color TV set, a tape recorder,
                    and a transformer. The transformer would enable us to boost or reduce the local
                    current to the nominal 115-120 volts.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Our small team would go into an office or meeting room with all our gear, set it
                    down, and while Mr. Oh Hyung and I had the usual polite cup of tea, my driver
                    would plug everything together. The tape was, of course, cued and ready to go.
                    For example, many times I would go into the Governor's office and set the TV
                    down at the end of his coffee table and do the normal tea plus greeting chat
                    while the equipment was quickly attached. In moments, I was all ready to go.
                    Often, he would bring in most of his top staff, and they would all stand around
                    while I played a videotape. They enjoyed it, because of the novelty and because
                    it broke up their day of a constant stream of supplicants and complaints.</p>
                <p>Any time I wanted to go and see the Governor or Mayor, I would just call and say
                    we had a new tape on something I knew they would be interested in. I could take
                    it in and get out in about 20 minutes. They loved it. I could get in to see
                    governors, generals, etc. at the drop of a hat. It was really effective. I could
                    take it to a Rotary club lunch and set it up on a high table in the corner and
                    show a videotape, talk about it, and have a question period afterwards. It was
                    really basic communications, but you had to have a gimmick. The gimmick was the
                    TV set, which was only a 12 or 14 inch set and was great at the end of a coffee
                    table. For the bigger shows, we had larger 18 or 20 inch sets. My driver and Mr.
                    Oh were pretty good at this. We would do four or five showings in a day. I would
                    go to Chonju and hit the university, the mayor's office, and business groups,
                    one right after the other, showing the same tape. While we were saying goodby,
                    my driver would re-cue the tape and pack it up, and we would then drive off to
                    the next stop. It was a real road show.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you married while you were there, or did you come
                        back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: While I was in Kwangju, right at the end of my tour. We came back to
                    Washington, mainly so my wife would have a chance to become acclimated to the
                    American scene and complete her citizenship. I, of course, had to find something
                    that would be of interest as a Foreign Service Officer in Washington. As it
                    turned out, I had an unusual opportunity.</p>
                <p>During my tenure as Center Director in Kwangju, we had a research study in
                    country on the use of our libraries. The conclusions of that study were at
                    variance with my experience and designs for our library, and I took the occasion
                    to draft a lengthy memo to Seoul, detailing the specifics and reasoning behind
                    my objections. I sent it to Seoul and forgot about it. When I came up for
                    assignment, I got a call asking if I would be willing to come back to the Office
                    of Research. My boss in Seoul, Mort Smith, had appended my protests to the Post
                    response to the study, and the head of Research, Jim Moceri, had evidently taken
                    a shine to it. He evidently had some sympathy for what I had written. He wanted
                    me to come back and show what I could do. So I got a year of university training
                    for social science research in preparation for spending a tour in USIA's
                    research division.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point. We will pick it up next
                        time in 1973. You took some time studying at the university and are going to
                        be in USIA research division.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. You were doing research in the U.S. when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I went back in 1972 and spent a year at the George Washington University
                    where I studied mostly statistics and things that were related to doing
                    statistical studies. This was in preparation for what was called the field
                    injection program. It was run by the Office of Research in order to bring field
                    experience back to Washington to fill what otherwise would be line jobs in
                    research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came into the research division in 1973 and stayed how
                        long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Until 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you tell us what you were up to, could you explain
                        where the research division fits in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The Office of Research is the office within USIA which evaluates USIA
                    products. Normally when we have a program or an event, you do an evaluation at
                    the end, but that is by the people who are doing it. This was an independent
                    evaluation of the effectiveness of USIA products. Did the products achieve the
                    goals for which they were designed, have the intended effect abroad, and what
                    possibilities would there be to improve on them? We looked at publications, film
                    shows, cultural center operations, the Voice of America, and other USIA
                    products. We also took social science or public opinion data from abroad and
                    produced what would be political analysis of foreign audience feelings about the
                    US, etc. That was the principal product which then got fed to the White House,
                    and as far as I know still does. It gives us a “state of the world” in regard to
                    impressions of the US.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in a way, there was a two fold mission. One, to see how
                        well you were doing and whether you could do something, and the other, just
                        to inform policy makers about how people looked at us.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>YATES: That's right. And whether or not the programs we were doing had a bearing
                    on those attitudes. So it was a measure also of effectiveness in a longer term.
                    The problem is that many USIA programs are hard to measure. You send a person to
                    the U.S. on a grant, and he may wander around the country for a month, meet a
                    lot of people in his field of interest as well as people in government, do a
                    little touring and stay with an American family, usually in the Middle West. He
                    gets a concept of what the size of the country is and some of the ideas and
                    policies behind it. How then does that person put into practice what he got on
                    that kind of trip? This is particularly the case for programs like the
                    International Visitor Program where you bring somebody here for about a month.
                    Nonetheless, the theory is that these people are communicators of a sort, having
                    positions in government, private business, etc. where they would then pass on
                    some of their more knowledgeable ideas about what the U.S. is about. It is
                    pretty hard to determine whether or not they do. That is what research is up
                    to.</p>
                <p>I joined the media side looking at products rather than generic opinion abroad.
                    While I was in the Office of Research, I worked on several projects. One of the
                    first things I worked on was a Brazil binational center study to see whether or
                    not it was reaching the audience it should. The study had been going on for many
                    years and was a dog of a study, since it was not very well defined. I didn't
                    spend much time on it, because it wasn't worth much and to be honest didn't
                    generate interest. Latin America was not a place where I had any experience. So
                    I went on to other things.</p>
                <p>First, I did a study of our Information Center operation in Lebanon. Information
                    Center as opposed to Binational Center. The Information Center was run and
                    staffed by us, a Binational Center was staffed by somebody else and usually
                    headed by a Foreign Service Officer. They would collect money, teach English,
                    and do things like that. Whereas an Information Center was chiefly a library, a
                    point of contact for the local audience.</p>
                <p>I made a trip to Beirut where we were doing the study. We had a Palestinian under
                    subcontract, a very smart guy who predicted at the time (1974) that the
                    Palestinians would not stop, the fighting would go on and get much worse, and it
                    did. I remember being in that beautiful city with its great places to eat and
                    nice people. Even then, however, after dinner at the home of the Public Affairs
                    Officer, she told me to be careful on my way back to the hotel, because there
                    was still some trouble on the streets. When I got out on the street, I could
                    hear the machine guns not too far distant - but far enough so that I wasn't too
                    worried - but it was a good reminder that things were not stable.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>While I was in Beirut, I took a weekend and went off to Baalbek, the old Roman
                    ruins outside the city. Very shortly thereafter, it became inaccessible. The
                    Bekaa Valley was the hot bed of Palestinian sentiment. On the way back from the
                    trip, the bus was stuck in a traffic jam. The president of Lebanon was out
                    there, and the local people were sacrificing a goat in the middle of the street,
                    so I got to see a little Lebanese culture. To go to the National Museum where
                    they keep the stone coffin which is the first direct evidence of a written
                    language was an interesting and enlightening experience.</p>
                <p>In the Center study, we were looking at the effectiveness of film shows, using
                    panels, a technique of interviewing people in a group on impact, etc. We didn't
                    get very firm results. First off, the troubles were starting to happen in
                    Lebanon. I think the results of the study fell by the wayside later, because it
                    no longer was important, given the general breakdown of the society.</p>
                <p>The second study I did related to an analysis of a quarterly Agency publication,
                    the controversial notebook compilation of technical articles on the American
                    economy called Economic Portfolio. It was a quarterly publication done under
                    contract with the University of Pittsburgh. The woman who ran it later became
                    the president of the World Bank. She edited this version of American economic
                    writings every quarter for USIA which then reproduced it and distributed it
                    worldwide in a very limited way. Recipients had to be high level economists in
                    order to understand the math and other contents of the technical volume.</p>
                <p>It was an experience to target a very small group of people who were very
                    important to us, the advisors to presidents, ministers of finance, and people
                    who dealt with economics on a day-to-day basis. I had full control of the
                    project, since the publication had been slated to be canceled as ineffective,
                    but the deputy director of the Agency at the time, Gene Kopp, thought that we
                    should at least have some empirical data on which to base the decision. I was
                    selected as the researcher, since it was not a mainline project and others were
                    simply not interested. That gave me full control. I designed the study, operated
                    the mechanics of contact, and did the final analysis.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>The study was a written one. I mailed out a questionnaire to all recipients of
                    Economic Portfolio and to the Public Affairs Officers who supervised the
                    programs in countries where there were recipients. Portfolio was going to be
                    closed as being too specialized, and those who generally rated programs had very
                    low regard for it, since they felt that it probably didn't have any effect on
                    the intended audience. Their logic held that it was a waste of time, difficult
                    to get together, and never on time anyway. The decision was based on almost
                    unanimous Post sentiment to cut it in favor of other, more productive programs.I
                    sent out questionnaires worldwide. It took some time for the responses to come
                    in, but the surprising thing was that we began to get some very remarkable
                    results. First off, many of the questionnaires were addressed to ministers or
                    advisors and very senior people in these governments, and most of them answered
                    personally, many in long hand. It turned out that the Economic Portfolio was
                    very highly prized. For example, while I was on the study, I got an urgent call
                    from the Greek Embassy in Washington. Evidently their minister was in the U.S.
                    for an IMF (International Monetary Fund) meeting and recalled an article he had
                    read in an issue of Economic Portfolio. He had not brought it with him and asked
                    the embassy if it could locate a copy of that particular issue, so he could use
                    it during the IMF meeting. That is what you call “direct evidence of
                    effectiveness.”</p>
                <p>I got long personal letters from people like members of the Bundestag, and even
                    the French ambassador to Japan, who had been receiving it before, wrote a letter
                    asking if it would be possible for him still to get a copy, even though he was
                    now in Japan. He prized the publication so much that he would appreciate it if
                    we could arrange it. We got almost 100 percent response, unheard of in most
                    surveys. Also, I got a letters from Guyana which was then communist-led. We had,
                    I believe, six copies that went into Guyana, and all six recipients wrote back
                    giving the publication the highest possible accolades. These were people who
                    were advising a communist government and taking American economic theory
                    straight off the top. An interesting situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to turn things around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, the Agency switched its decision despite the contrary opinion of its
                    senior program people. The parallel study, that assessing the related PAOs, came
                    out 180 degrees different. Assuredly because they knew little of economics and
                    could not understand the complex jargon it employed in its articles, they found
                    it boring and irrelevant. The real situation, as revealed in the larger survey,
                    was that the publication was having a direct impact on some of the world's most
                    influential economic thinkers, irrespective of the kind of government they
                    belonged to. That publication made a difference, but it was difficult to see
                    that in the results that the Posts regularly reported in their assessments of
                    their programs. It took some staff time to handle the bulky notebooks when they
                    irregularly arrived, and the people to whom they were addressed were not a part
                    of the traditional USIA country audience.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>The final result was a happy one, as Economic Portfolio was resumed. We didn't
                    miss a beat; every copy went out, because it had such a heavy impact on some
                    very important people. The principle was one that was useful but not very well
                    applied later. If you are careful at what you are designing and aim at the right
                    audience, they listen. I used that advice later on in Japan when I had an
                    assignment there for the same thing with some similar effect. But that was one
                    of the principal efforts in research.</p>
                <p>The third area where I had some impact in research was on the computer side. When
                    I arrived, they were still doing things with pen and quill, so to speak. So I
                    joined the fray to encourage the installation of computer facilities to process
                    data in house. Eventually, the Office of Research adopted that advice. Also, I
                    had a role in obtaining a statistical package called SPSS, the Statistical
                    Package for the Social Sciences, which I had used in my courses at the George
                    Washington University. I got USIA to buy a copy of that, so that the analysts
                    could use it in their work. They have gone much beyond that now, but it was an
                    important innovation at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a tendency that I have heard people talking
                        about, particularly AID, where you send a tree expert out to some country
                        and all of a sudden you have tree programs. If there is an anti-malaria
                        person to Iceland, you end up with an anti-malaria program there. Did you
                        find a similar thing happening in USIA where people would try to establish
                        whatever their specialty was? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I never saw it as a problem. That cuts both ways. If somebody has a
                    specialty in anti-malarial program and ends up being sent to Iceland, that is
                    not very practical. But usually the real situation was much different than that.
                    For example, somebody who was a very good exhibits person would go to a country
                    that hadn't used exhibits very well and would develop exhibits as a program.
                    That would be natural and was good. It gave variety to the program. In USIA
                    where you had people with different personal interests, it meant that they would
                    talk to different people in that country, so that programs had a better spread
                    within the society. If you only had political people coming through all the
                    time, you would end up with a bunch of professors and political scientists who
                    would be the only people that particular post would talk with. You need an
                    artist once in a while. You need somebody with a background in economics or even
                    computers. It spreads the impact of particular work.</p>
                <p>In the business of communications and personal contact, you never know when
                    things will appear from places that are most unexpected. In Kwangju, I had a
                    close friend who was publisher of a local newspaper, the Kwangju Ilbo. Mr. Kim
                    was an older man who spoke only Korean, no English. He was a little distant at
                    first, but I got to know him and his son who was heir apparent to the newspaper.
                    It was a very successful newspaper, and he decided to buy a radio station. He
                    named the radio station VOC, the “Voice of Chonil.”</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>Subsequent to the purchase of the radio station, I was in his office and said, “I
                    am curious. Why did you name this thing VOC?” He said, “There is a connection
                    with America. When I was a young man, I wasn't a student, wasn't in school, and
                    didn't have much book learning. In the late fifties after the war, I didn't have
                    anything, I was broke. The only place I could go in Kwangju which would make me
                    comfortable was the USIS library. I didn't speak any English, but I would go in
                    and look at the pictures in the books and magazines. In the summer time, it was
                    air conditioned, and in the winter time, it had heat.” So for him, it was very
                    nice. He said “Nobody there knew who I was. I walked in unannounced and wouldn't
                    talk to anybody or ask any questions. I just came and left. But nobody ever
                    threw me out. I wasn't the best dressed guy in town, but nobody ever asked why I
                    was there or accused me of doing anything wrong or being out of place.” He said
                    he never forgot that. He said his VOC was in some way a remembrance of the
                    experience he had in the USIS center and therefore a reflection of the name of
                    the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>This was an interesting lesson. He was one of those unknown people who would
                    simply show up in our locations. Not invited, but not rejected and not judged.
                    The activity was a passive one, in that we did not specifically target a
                    particular sector of the society or, at least, did not exclude those who might
                    not fit our preconceptions. Our libraries were exactly in keeping with the
                    design of Ben Franklin who saw them as a resource for the entire community. We
                    didn't keep their names and didn't know who they were, but they received an
                    impression, received something from their visits that lasts their whole life.
                    Mr. Kim Nam Joong, the owner of VOC, also later became the National Assemblyman
                    from Kwangju, a major player in the government party. At the time, he owned the
                    only big hotel in Kwangju and was rich and influential. But he owed us in a very
                    Asian way, a semblance of a debt, and the way to repay it was naming his station
                    VOC. The same kind of thing was true in other parts of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In USIA 1973-75, what was the spirit? This is both Nixon,
                        Ford, and part of Watergate. What was your impression of the
                        leadership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It was sort of irrelevant to what I was doing. As a Foreign Service
                    Officer, you marched to the drummer of the moment. That didn't mean that we were
                    politicized. Our programs were mainly talking about America, not the Republican
                    or Democratic Party or the intricacies of the political world in Washington.
                    This is not an inside-the-beltway operation except in Washington. Outside of
                    Washington, you are no longer within the beltway, and larger things become more
                    important. The Nixon experience had to be explained abroad as best we could. We
                    had to explain Ford and what he did. This was all important to other countries'
                    policy makers, but there are other channels for that. Embassy officers,
                    themselves, talk with their political counterparts and foreign ministries, for
                    example. So USIA itself was not always engaged in the depth of political
                    intrigue in Washington. It wasn't always relevant.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes you would get a leadership in USIA which had
                        very strong ideological or tactical points of view. Did you feel that then
                        or was this, as far as you were concerned, business as usual? Were you
                        concerned about the leadership at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: No, because the leadership in the agency over the years expressed those
                    ideological points of view principally in the Washington environment. One strong
                    example of that was when Frank Shakespeare was Director. Shakespeare had strong
                    conservative feelings and pushed a special agenda which, for example, mandated
                    that all career officers would have to spend at least one tour in a communist
                    society so as to learn the nature of that system. In principle, there may have
                    been some merit to knowing one's enemy, but in practice, it never had a chance,
                    since there weren't enough spaces in the communist world to permit all officers
                    to be circulated through. Moreover, not everyone was tuned to the Slavic
                    languages or cultures. The Foreign Service was a service of specialists who,
                    although generalists by design, were specialists at heart and would gravitate to
                    those parts of the world where they felt special resonance.</p>
                <p>Charlie Wick had very strong feelings about lots of things that were not always
                    carefully thought through in a political sense, but he certainly had good
                    connections in the White House. And I went through a whole lot of people who
                    didn't have any real political image at all. The best of the group were those
                    who had a strong image, and the reason was that they commanded attention.
                    Charlie Wick, who created Worldnet, was an example of that. Some people thought
                    he was crazy. He was famous for his office rages during which, it was said,
                    special distinction was given to the individual who was on the receiving end of
                    Wick's thrown glasses. His staff were reportedly always picking his glasses up
                    off the floor. He would get mad and toss them at the offending individual and
                    tell them that they were fired.</p>
                <p>Of course, he couldn't fire anyone, because Foreign Service Officers and Civil
                    Servants had tenure, but it made him feel better. That was the way he showed his
                    displeasure. He didn't hold grudges. Some people whom I knew felt he was very
                    human. Like Frank Shakespeare, Charlie Wick had the ear of the White House and
                    was able to maintain a reasonably stable budget. He was able to articulate to
                    friends or to people who agreed with him in Congress the importance of that
                    budget and why it was essential to keep things going. So the Director and the
                    political types inside the beltway kept the machine running, but the work of the
                    agency was done abroad, with the exception of Voice of America, of course.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: I arrived there in 1976 was and left in 1978. I had about three months of
                    Dari while I was still finishing up research projects. By that time, I had
                    Japanese, Korean, and now Dari. Dari is a variation of old Persian. To a Farsi
                    speaker, which is the contemporary form of Persian, it has an odd accent which
                    some see as crude; something like that heard from someone from Brooklyn if they

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Afghanistan was a monarchy, and the people had overthrown the king, who
                    left the country. Their prime minister was a prince of the royal family,
                    Mohammed Daud. The problem with Afghanistan was that it was never a unified
                    country. The borders were created by the British. The British invaded
                    Afghanistan three times and lost three times. They did foolish things. For
                    example, they would build fortresses as they would do in Europe and put them on
                    the highest hill to command the surrounding territory. This was great for
                    artillery but lousy for water. The Afghans thought they were crazy and they
                    were. Those fortresses the British built still stand unoccupied and pristine,
                    since nobody could ever use them because of the lack of water. If the British
                    built and occupied one of these hilltop fortresses, the Afghans would simply
                    surround them and wait for them to die of thirst. The British tried and tried
                    and tried. They saw Afghanistan as an important buffer between British India and
                    the Russian empire.</p>
                <p>However, the interior part of the country hasn't got much to pull it together.
                    The center of the country is mountainous and occupied by the Hazara. In the
                    north, you have all the Turkmen types. In the south, you have the Pashtuns. To
                    the west, of course, you have the Persians. You have the Dravidian culture in
                    the southern part of the Indian peninsula, the Turkish culture to the north and
                    the Persian culture to the west. In the middle of all this are the leftovers
                    from the time when Genghis Khan swept through, the Hazara. Alexander the Great
                    went through Afghanistan and was finally defeated by disease after his marriage
                    to an Afghan bride. Anybody who wanted to conquer anything sort of ended up
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the fun guys.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>YATES: All the fun guys did a lot of damage. Afghanistan is a beautiful land, and
                    the traditional kings that lived there had a very different life style from many
                    of their peers in other states. Kabul was the capital, but it got cold in the
                    winter, so they went south to the Helmand valley, which is a beautiful valley
                    that the U.S. had worked with the Afghan government to bring water in for
                    irrigation. The old kings, who predated the Mogul period in India, built palaces
                    - not fortresses - at Lashkar Gah, located where the Helmand and Arghandab
                    rivers meet. They had running water and sewer systems but no defenses. They
                    built a small citadel on a slight rise to which they retreated in case of
                    conflict. But the palaces themselves were not very well protected. It is graphic
                    testimony to the fact that the kings lived a rather pleasant, peaceful life
                    among the people.</p>
                <p>They each had a big palace with water fountains and all those things you see in
                    Persian literature. In fact, the architects who came from Persia did all the
                    architectural work which we now remember as part of Mogul India. These
                    architects influenced buildings like the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, and many other
                    places in and around Delhi. You found that the palaces that were in ruin in
                    Lashkar Gah and the mosque, part of which was still standing when I visited,
                    greatly resembled the things you see in India as examples of Mogul architecture.
                    It was a fascinating place to have visited. I always loved to go down there,
                    wander around the ruins of the palaces, and sit and look through those old
                    windows over the river.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our policy towards Afghanistan during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: We didn't have much of a policy, because we didn't have much interest in
                    Afghanistan. At the time, the Soviets really had control of the country. They
                    had everything but the flag. They were the advisors in the military and the
                    teachers in most of the higher institutes of learning. They controlled the
                    medical system, and there were strong communist supporters throughout the
                    government. Essentially, they had a throttle-hold on the country at that point,
                    so we didn't have any specific or direct influence. You may recall that back in
                    the Eisenhower days, the king asked the U.S. to supply them with weapons, but we
                    refused. He then went to the Russians, and the Russians came across with the
                    weapons. That is essentially what brought the Russians in, our refusal to give
                    them arms. Now, you can say this was a wise decision to stop the spread of
                    armaments, and this was clearly the intent of the Eisenhower administration's
                    policy. We have to draw the line somewhere, and this is as good a place as any.
                    But the consequences of that decision later on meant that the Russians had full
                    sway in Afghanistan.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>When I got there in 1976, the Afghans were making progress. They had leather
                    factories going and were making significant strides in women's rights, giving
                    them education and bringing them into the workplace. Traditionally in Afghan
                    society, women were not given an education. They were considered to be barefoot,
                    in the kitchen, and pregnant. That is what their function was. Only males could
                    receive education. When we gave aid under the USAID program, a stipulation was
                    that whenever we built a school, it had to be coeducational or at least divided
                    in the middle, so that all the boys were on one side and the girls on the other.
                    I visited some of those schools and saw the education that the girls were
                    receiving. Smart kids.</p>
                <p>On the other side, we gave aid also for social welfare progress. We had gotten
                    out of the capital intensive projects such as dams and roads. Previously, USAID
                    programs had built all of the east-west roads; the Russians built all the
                    north-south roads. The roadbeds were different, although all very good. Ours
                    were built for internal communication, and the Russians were obviously built for
                    external communication. The Russians were extracting stuff, copper, oranges, and
                    natural gas. They were sucking the place dry. It was clear what they were up to.
                    The Afghans were very unhappy, because the Russians were pumping natural gas out
                    of Afghanistan, but the meter telling how much gas they were taking was on the
                    Russian side of the border. The Russians would report to the Afghans how much
                    they had taken. The Afghans were not sure the Russians were being honest in the
                    amount.</p>
                <p>Afghans were uncomfortable with the Russians and didn't trust them. The Russians
                    were non-believers, atheists. They didn't have a book, the book being the Bible,
                    or in this case the word of Mohammed. They were ambivalent about Christians;
                    since they had a book, they must have a soul. The Russians had no book, and thus
                    no soul. If you shot a Russian, it was of no consequence. You would be more
                    distressed over shooting a dog, because, although the dog couldn't read, it had
                    a function, to protect the family or caravan. A Russian had no soul and no
                    function. There was nothing lost, in the Afghan way of thinking.</p>
                <p>The Russians had a big embassy in Kabul, much bigger than ours. Their policy of
                    assignment was that Russian Foreign Service Officers would be assigned there for
                    life. Every six months, we had a Russian/American night as part of our detente
                    activities, because the two Ambassadors had set the practice up as an expression
                    of good will. Nobody ever wanted the responsibility of setting these up, and it
                    was usually relatively junior members of the embassy who ended up doing it. I
                    remember one afternoon, I went to the Russian Embassy in order to fulfill my
                    responsibilities in organizing the next Russian/American night. The Russian
                    Embassy was located in a rather unkempt building on the other side of town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the Soviet Embassy at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes, but to the Afghans they were Russians. Anyway, I went to the Soviet
                    Embassy and was ushered into a very large empty room. In the middle of this
                    ballroom was a settee, two arm chairs, and a coffee table, all nicely covered. I
                    was met at the door by a younger staffer who took me into the room and sat me
                    down and said, “Would you like tea?” I said, “Thank you, yes.” He then left me
                    all by myself in the middle of this big room. I looked up at the walls, and they
                    had big portraits of Brezhnev, Stalin, and other Soviet leaders hanging there.
                    But there were a couple of places on the wall where there was an outline of a
                    former portrait which was gone. Obviously, there had been a change in the line
                    up, and they hadn't bothered to replace the portrait that they took down.</p>
                <p>Two or three minutes after my young man went off to the right, on the left hand
                    side one of the little panels in the side of the wall slid open, and a lady
                    comes through with a tea service and three cups, which told me I was obviously
                    going to be joined by somebody. Sure enough, a couple of minutes later in comes
                    another man. We conversed for a while, but there was still another cup, so I
                    knew we had another to join. He said, “Well, maybe it would be a good idea if we
                    had someone join us to plan this thing.” I thought that probably was all right.
                    About three seconds later, a door slides open and in comes a third person. The
                    Soviets obviously had cameras and microphones trained on us, because somebody
                    somewhere was communicating in and out of this room without my knowledge and
                    without direct contact. It was kind of fun.</p>
                <p>The KGB people, who were all over Kabul, were assigned to the embassy under
                    cover, but you could always tell who they were, because they would come to these
                    Russian/American nights dressed like Americans in sport coats and kind of flashy
                    ties, something you would see in a movie. They spoke very good English and were
                    very polished. They were very cynical about Afghanistan, obviously to try to
                    drag you out and make you express yourself cynically about Afghanistan as well.
                    One can only speculate on the reasons.</p>
                <p>The local stratification within the embassy was very clear. Policy people spoke
                    very good English, dressed well, and fraternized with Americans, but people who
                    were not policy people did not speak to you. If you spoke to them, they would
                    smile and run away. Most of them were women, probably spouses, or possibly house
                    servants. The Russians, of course, did not hire Afghans to man positions in the
                    embassy at any level. One of the basic differences among the foreign embassies
                    was that the east bloc would only be staffed with nationals of the country of
                    the embassy. Americans were always surrounded by Foreign Service Nationals from
                    the host country. In many instances, they were more important to the conduct of
                    bilateral relations than were a number of the Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>The Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) provided continuity - they often were career
                    people who spent decades working for the embassy. Their eyes and ears provided
                    insight into what was happening locally, apart from the public record in the
                    newspapers, and their responsibilities often were fairly senior. While Americans
                    set the policy and the direction of embassy programs, it was FSNs that offered
                    local judgement, gave counsel on contacts, served as intermediaries with the
                    leadership and other “movers and shakers” of the country, and assisted with
                    translation duties. Naturally, direct hires from the community supplied drivers,
                    cooks, cleaning staff, and other services that a complex embassy needed. They
                    kept all of us in touch and eased the problems of living abroad. Embassies that
                    did not utilize FSNs to the degree we did were seriously handicapped. In
                    addition to all their work, they also became good friends and really committed
                    to establishing and maintaining active bilateral relations. The Russians,
                    however, had none of these benefits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Ted Eliot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: He was very relaxed. He had worked for USIA at one point in his career and
                    had a lot of interest in what we did. Another reason was that in Afghanistan,
                    there wasn't much other work to do. We didn't have much in the way of economic
                    connections and no significant military programs to speak of. Politically,
                    Afghanistan was an important buffer state between the Soviet Union and the
                    subcontinent, but Americans had little connection there. Internally, there was
                    the usual intrigue and infighting that provided the fodder for political
                    reporting, but activities in that landlocked country did not figure large in
                    American concerns.</p>
                <p>However, the USIA program was a very vigorous one. We had one USIA center in
                    Kabul with a library and small auditorium, as well as a pretty good staff. We
                    operated throughout the country with our programs and while travel was
                    important, most of our contacts were in Kabul where all governmental activity
                    was concentrated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have always been surprised at meeting Afghans who, since
                        the unpleasantness in 1979, seemed to have gravitated to working in
                        libraries, at least in the Washington area. I have seen them in Georgetown
                        and George Washington University libraries. Very pleasant and obviously
                        well-educated people.</hi>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>YATES: USAID operated a very big dam and irrigation project in the Helmand area
                    during the late sixties, and as Information Officer, I came up with an idea for
                    a film explaining the project to the Afghan public. I wrote the concept, did the
                    research on location, took a film crew down to get some initial footage, wrote
                    the script, arranged for the soundtrack music, and completed the storyboard for
                    the film crew we used from Afghan Film. Because of the film, I made a number of
                    trips to Lashkar Gah, Kandahar, and the Helmand region. It was an interesting
                    story.</p>
                <p>We were having troubles with Soviet pressure on the Afghan government to withdraw
                    its support from the AID project in the Helmand valley. We had built a big dam
                    at Kajaki with support by the Afghans. The Afghan government was putting money
                    into this program in a matching arrangement with the original USAID grants. The
                    problem with the program was that we had irrigated the land, but the Afghans had
                    said they didn't want big drainage ditches. Their reasoning was that the ditches
                    were useless and would just take water away, while they wanted to keep the
                    incoming water in the area of the crops.</p>
                <p>Of course, since the water did not have a means to run off, what remained
                    evaporated, leaving behind a deposit of salts. Over time, the irrigated land
                    became saline, and crop yields were diminishing. The Soviets wanted the Afghans
                    to put the resources that they had into the Soviet-sponsored provinces. We had
                    the Helmand-Arghandab River area and the Soviets had the orange growing area in
                    the east and northeast part of the country. The Soviets wanted to see those
                    resources diverted and we didn't. So what I came up with as Information Officer,
                    was to do a film to explain the project and frankly deal with the desalinization
                    problem and show what can be done when you do irrigate with drainage
                    ditches.</p>
                <p>Wisely, USIA in Washington hired an American Director out of a Boston documentary
                    film company, Urban Image, to do the final work on the film. We produced a 15
                    minute documentary on the valley that I think was very effective. After the
                    revolution in 1978 when the communists took over, we closed up the embassy and
                    sent everybody home. I am told that the only thing that was running for any
                    entertainment in Kabul at all was that film. They ran it continuously about
                    eight or nine hours a day. They had full audiences all the time. There was
                    nothing else to do in town.</p>
                <p>There were even a lot of communists from the government who came over to watch
                    the film, because there was nothing else to do. They enjoyed the music. The
                    music that I picked was through a friend of mine named Madadi who worked at
                    Radio Afghanistan, a music major who was trained in Germany. He was a collector
                    of Afghan folk music, and would invite people from outside Kabul, sheep herders
                    and others who would learn self-taught flute and traditional instruments, to
                    come in to Radio Afghanistan studios at any time. He would record their music,
                    and if he liked it, he would put them on the air. You would get some beautiful,
                    haunting music, mostly based on local folk tunes and traditions. All of it was
                    recorded and then archived at Radio Afghanistan. It was wonderful music -
                    completely artless, pure music.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>I asked him to come up with some suggestions as to what he thought would be
                    suitable. He came up with a couple of tapes, and I went through them and picked
                    out the pieces I thought sounded right for the kind of story board I had put
                    together. I heard later there were some comments about where I got the music. It
                    was one of the most satisfying projects I completed in my career and possibly
                    had some sort of undetermined effect on the thinking of Afghans who watched it.
                    When I returned to the U.S. some time later, a friend rescued a print from the
                    archives that were slated for destruction, and I ran it through a “film chain”
                    to make a videotape copy. I still have that copy and will reminisce by watching
                    it now and then. It was a lot of fun to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the political officers. Was it
                        difficult for them to do anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: There were some dangers there, because the society at the time was at
                    least half communist and there were threats. The CIA station chief specifically
                    was threatened with death. Toward the end, we all were threatened with being
                    shot on the street if we were to come out. We got what was described as an
                    “educated Afghan” letter dropped in our library, saying unless the U.S.
                    government declared solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle
                    with Israel, they would start shooting Americans on the street at random.</p>
                <p>We had the usual security lectures. We were supposed to vary our route to and
                    from the embassy or our USIS offices daily. That didn't work at all, because
                    there were few roads and equally few options to use as variations. The threats
                    were serious nonetheless, and we all had to take precautions. For example, the
                    security officer brought a crew to the USIS compound to install solid metal
                    doors which he planned to have propped open during normal times, but which might
                    be dropped over the windows in an emergency. I protested strongly, since the
                    solid metal doors probably would not provide much protection in any event and
                    would serve principally to block the natural light from our offices and probably
                    diminish the flow of fresh air in the dusty climate. One victim of the plan
                    before the whole project was abandoned was a small tree outside of my window. I
                    had cherished that tree, since there were few green things in the compound where
                    we were located, and although it was not much more than a weed, it was a green
                    weed that softened the stark atmosphere of the office. Security problems caught
                    up with the embassy, however, and after Ambassador Eliot left, his replacement,
                    Spike Dubs was captured and taken to the Kabul Hotel downtown where he was
                    killed in a shoot-out between the rebels and the army. To my knowledge, no one
                    ever determined who was responsible for the Ambassador's death.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: I had a bird's eye view of it. I was in the office on the Saturday morning
                    in April, as usual to pick up the traffic and read and work on the wireless
                    file. A few of our local employees were in the back, working on a project for
                    our print shop. It was about 10:30 when I heard a commotion and a big explosion
                    somewhere outside, not very far away. In no more than about 30 seconds after
                    that, the telephone rang and the Marine guard at the embassy asked if I had
                    heard anything funny? The embassy was about a mile, or a mile and a half, from
                    the USIS offices. I said that I had. He thought I had better leave for home,
                    because there was something serious going on.</p>
                <p>The American Embassy where the Marine Guard stood watch was somewhat outside of
                    town on the road to the airport. He said that they had seen a column of tanks
                    heading into town a few minutes earlier. What had happened was, the tanks had
                    proceeded down the airport road and had come to a stop in front of the Ministry
                    of Interior, about a block and a half away from the USIS building. They had
                    fired a round into the ministry and that was what I had heard.</p>
                <p>I shooed everybody out, the local employees who were working in my graphics shop
                    and those in the print shop, locked the place up, and went home. By the time I
                    got home, things had started in earnest. I put the car in the garage and locked
                    the gate. Fortunately Young Ne had earlier gone back to the U.S. for a break
                    away from the boredom of the two-year tour. She was staying with my parents in
                    Mystic, Connecticut, awaiting my return at the close of my tour in Kabul several
                    months later.</p>
                <p>Inside the yard, our house man, Saqui, was mowing the lawn. We had an enormous
                    lawn. The house had been owned by a German couple many years ago and then a
                    mayor of Kabul or some other high ranking official had lived there. It was an
                    enormous piece of property. We paid a pittance for it, because the embassy had
                    leased it on a very long lease years before. Saqui was mowing the lawn, and I
                    told him there was trouble and he should come into the house, which had very
                    thick walls. Saqui said, “No, no, I am cutting the lawn, and I am almost done.
                    Just another five minutes, no problem.” He kept pushing the hand mower, and I
                    repeated my insistence that he come into the house. Just as I finished the
                    sentence, there was a “tut-tut-tut” through the trees above our heads and leaves
                    began to flutter down around our ears from the shells going through the trees.
                    Saqui then decided the idea was probably good and came into the house.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Afghans were fighting Afghans, so they were all using the same equipment and
                    wearing the same uniforms. Our house covered the better part of a half a block,
                    with the remaining part the block consisting of a Mercedes dealership and a
                    small battery factory. At one point, an armored personnel carrier appeared on
                    one side of the block. You could hear the grinding of the armored personnel
                    carrier as it crept slowly along, obviously searching. It had a machine gun
                    mounted on top.</p>
                <p>On the other side of the block, the other side of the compound, was a tank. If
                    you looked out the window, you could see the phosphorus streak of every third or
                    fourth shell when the tank fired. They weren't firing at us in the house, but
                    they certainly were close. This cat and mouse game went on for about an hour and
                    then ceased, as they tired of the game and moved away. I never knew what finally
                    happened. There also was a machine gun on the top of a police box which was
                    about a block away to the southwest, and whichever factions controlled the
                    police station kept firing over the yard beside the house. So there was a lot of
                    stuff flying around.</p>
                <p>I didn't feel directly threatened at that time, because the walls of the house
                    were pretty thick and would have stopped any kind of ordinance from a smaller
                    weapon. The danger was aircraft. In the early afternoon, they starting strafing
                    the royal palace which was about two blocks away on the other side of a park in
                    “Sharinow,” the new city of Kabul, near the Blue Mosque. I was on the
                    northwestern side of the palace. The jets were approaching from the south,
                    strafing the palace and then lifting up. Just about where the house was, they
                    would hit the afterburners to give enough boost to come around to make another
                    run. There were one or several jets continuously at the game for at least an
                    hour and a half.</p>
                <p>The problem was stray shots that landed in places that were unintended. At one
                    point early in the afternoon, I was in the kitchen. I had moved the refrigerator
                    slightly away from the wall, since I thought that crouching behind it would
                    increase my safety while in the kitchen which had thinner walls than the other
                    parts of the house and therefore did not provide the same protection. I decided
                    I would eat as solid a lunch as I could, before it got dark and we possibly lost
                    power. Behind the refrigerator was an interior wall and then a small room about
                    6 feet wide, somewhat bigger than a closet, where we stored firewood. It also
                    served as a pantry. On the other side of the external pantry wall was a battery
                    shop where they repaired car batteries.</p>
                <p>While crouching behind the refrigerator trying to wolf down a piece of steak I
                    had managed to fry for lunch, even though everything had to be done reaching up
                    from the crawling posture on the floor, there was a bang next door, a sort of
                    thud and crash. I didn't pay much attention to it, with all the noise of the
                    jets passing over. Not until later did I learn that a stray rocket that had been
                    fired at the palace hit the shop, was a dud and didn't go off. Luck was with me
                    that afternoon, since had the missile exploded, it would have blown me away or
                    at least buried me in the rubble of the pantry and kitchen wall. I was thankful
                    for the inefficiency of Russian arms. It was probably old ammunition. The
                    Russians were famous for giving the Afghans old junk that the Soviet forces
                    could not rely on any longer. At the time, I was thankful for that policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The strafing, noise, and vibration went on for about an hour and a half. Then
                    about 3:00 in the afternoon, there was a sudden violent thunderstorm. That sort
                    of event was most unusual in Kabul. Normally, a dust storm arrived around 3 to 4
                    in the afternoon. You could almost set your watch by it. On the days I was at
                    home in the afternoon, we would race around, slamming all the windows shut just
                    as the wind began to suddenly pick up and the rolling ball of dust would come
                    from the east and blanket everything exposed with a thick coating.</p>
                <p>On this day, however, all the military firing and explosions must have stirred up
                    the atmosphere enough to disturb the usual patterns and prompt thunder heads.
                    Whatever the cause, the heavy rain and gusting winds drove the jets away and
                    ended the strafing. When the rain let up, the jets did not return to the
                    strafing pattern over the royal palace, and the battle shifted more to the west.
                    Light bombers could be seen coming from the north east, probably from the Bagram
                    Air Base, on their way to the western part of town where the sound of explosions
                    could be heard. They were bombing military positions west of the city.
                    Thereafter, the bombing ceased in the vicinity of the Blue Mosque, although
                    small arms firing continued. The fight went on for about a day and a half. I
                    spent most of that time crawling around on the floor. I didn't dare go upstairs
                    where stray rounds might pick off the curious head above the window sill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your family with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Luckily Young Ne had gone off to the U.S. to study English at a summer
                    course at Georgetown. I was very thankful for that since it was a frightening
                    experience. She, of course, had similar experiences during the Korean War, and
                    the repetition of such events might have been unbearable for her. The worst part
                    of the fight was the uncertainty of what was going on and the prospect of losing
                    communication with others.</p>
                <p>When the fighting started, the telephone system was, of course, the first thing
                    to get damaged. I had one of those Motorola hand-held radios that the embassy
                    had issued for just such emergencies. Before the experience of the revolution,
                    those radios were a significant bother. They had to be left in a plugged-in
                    charger so that they would have a full battery, but the Marines used the
                    channels to run tests now and then, and the things could go off at all hours.
                    Those of us who had not gone through a real emergency did not have enough
                    experience to know how valuable they would become when things got hot.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>People who didn't have them suffered. In the beginning, I was able to maintain
                    contact with the embassy by telephone. When the telephone system started to go
                    down, it turned out I could call the western part of Kabul, but the embassy
                    could not. For some strange reason involving the exchange system, the embassy
                    could still call me by phone. So the embassy was able to relay a message to me,
                    and I could then call the AID people out in the western part of the city and
                    pass the information along. Of course, they could pass information on the
                    fighting in that area back to the embassy. If anything, their experiences were
                    much more severe than mine.</p>
                <p>I remember a call to one of the AID workers in the western part of Kabul. He
                    said, “What do I do? What do I do? I have two bodies in my driveway.” I told him
                    not to touch them and stay with his family under the heaviest furniture. The
                    greatest danger seemed to be curiosity, since the diplomatic community was not
                    among the combatants and had not taken sides. But inadvertently being in the way
                    was a real danger.</p>
                <p>For example, we in Kabul had a visiting baseball team from the American school in
                    Pakistan. Parents in Rawalpindi doubtless were worried about their children, and
                    there was a great sense of urgency to get word back that everybody was accounted
                    for and safe. We got most people accounted for. They were told to stay inside,
                    keep their doors locked, and stay underneath tables or anything heavy. As it
                    turned out, they did and no one was hurt.</p>
                <p>While unscathed, there was some psychic damage. The wife of one of the political
                    officers did not have a portable phone, and she could not understand anything
                    that was going on. Her husband was caught in the embassy when the fighting
                    started and could not return. Without his presence at home and lacking one of
                    the usually bothersome radiophones, she became distraught with fear and worry
                    and suffered enough psychologically to require medical attention, adding to the
                    concern of the rest of the community. The noise of the jets and the firing and
                    explosions just were too much.</p>
                <p>The only foreigners who were hurt in the fighting, as far as I know, were one or
                    two German embassy staffers who went outside and took pictures of the aircraft
                    while they were bombing and got hit in the legs by shrapnel or stray rounds.
                    Their wounds were only superficial, but later served as a warning to those who
                    would scoff at the constant remonstrations of the security people.</p>
                <p>The fighting gradually cooled over a day and a half. In the interim, I finally
                    lost telephone communication with the embassy and could no longer provide news
                    and information back and forth with the western part of the town and the USAID
                    compound there. Remarkably, however, the power remained on, and my trusty
                    radiophone kept me in touch. On the morning of the second day, I crawled
                    upstairs to look out and make sure that the quiet was real and that there was
                    nothing moving. I saw one taxi, as I peered over the second story window sill
                    onto the street running across the front of the house.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Unbelievable as it was, a tennis racquet slung over his shoulder, a German man
                    dressed in tennis whites pedaled into view on a bicycle, going to the German
                    club which was about a block to the north. To insist on the usual set of tennis
                    in the morning, in the face of the fighting and destruction of the previous
                    hours, was amazing, a display of total disdain for an obvious situation, one
                    that I had not seen before or since. He had to be either crazed by the fight,
                    simply did not care, or had found refuge in the sanity of habit. Perhaps he
                    reasoned it was not his fight, and no one would bother a diplomat on a simple
                    errand of tennis. I have no idea if he was able to play his game, but the sight
                    was remarkable, nonetheless.</p>
                <p>I later learned that several Peace Corps volunteers almost got hit, about the
                    same time as I was crouched behind the radiator. A live rocket that strayed from
                    its intended path into the Royal Palace flew over the Blue Mosque and killed
                    seven Afghans in an apartment immediately opposite the mosque. The apartment
                    that received the deadly munition was next to the one where the Peace Corps
                    volunteers were gathered. Fate was measured in fractions of degrees in altitude
                    and direction of the errant missile. It was perhaps the closest call for any of
                    the Americans resident in Kabul.</p>
                <p>After the fight was over, Afghan military people - I don't know from which side -
                    came around to ask if we had any damage and offered to fix whatever was
                    necessary. They went overboard to make sure that the foreigners who were not
                    combatants were not injured in any way. From all of the later reports, it was
                    evident that the Afghans took great pains to check on all foreigners and to
                    repair whatever damage their houses suffered from the fight. Some houses had
                    multiple bullet holes and other related damage, but no one had been seriously
                    hurt. Perhaps it was the traditional sense of Afghan hospitality in action.
                    Under the time-worn code, no harm must come to a visitor in your home, even if
                    he is your sworn enemy and has inflicted severe injury on you or your clan. As
                    long as the guest stays at your home, you are obligated to ply him with the best
                    food and hospitality. This is true, even though as soon as he leaves your
                    portal, you may murder him in retribution. Cruel code, but deeply imbued in the
                    Afghan psyche.</p>

                <p>YATES: The Afghan politics of the time were complicated. The previous king was
                    living in Italy. A prince of the royal family, Mohammed Daud, was serving as
                    President at the time of the coup and was summarily executed. There were a lot
                    of people who were similarly killed at the time of the coup, including people I
                    knew and had worked with. For example, Daud's son, who was a really quiet and
                    shy man with a beautiful wife and two young children, was a television producer.
                    I had worked with him on programming cultural events, such as “Clark Terry and
                    His Jolly Giants,” live on Afghan Television. As a producer, Daud's son had
                    worked with us several times on cultural programs. These programs had even
                    included a live performance of a U.S. Air Force band, the first such appearance
                    of an American military band in Afghanistan. He had no interest in politics. If
                    the subject of politics came up, he always politely and quietly demurred. His
                    only concern was his work at Afghan TV and his family. Later, I heard that he
                    was executed, along with his wife and two kids. They wiped out the family. The
                    Foreign Minister under Daud, Waheed Abdullah, with whom I had many visits to
                    bring in guests or reporters, was executed in his office. A lot of people whom I
                    knew from my work were either killed or driven out during that time. Some went
                    off into the hills and crossed over the border into Pakistan.</p>
                <p>The source of the revolution was partly ideological but more factional than
                    anything else. The Parchamists and Halquis were the two big major communist
                    factions involved in fighting the government. They feared that the government
                    was becoming more and more Westernized, and each had a particular vision of the
                    fate of the country and, of course, of the leadership which was to assume
                    control. The revolution was not founded on religious differences, even though
                    the communists, for the most part, were atheist, and the Muslims were
                    essentially on the previous government's side. For a long time, the communists
                    had complained about the privileged elite and the clear influence the royal
                    family still had in the affairs of state.</p>
                <p>How much direct influence the Soviets had on the event of the revolution is not
                    clear, although their agents thoroughly permeated every part of the military,
                    academic, and administrative sectors of society. Afghanistan was among the
                    poorest nations in the world, according to UN figures on per capita income, and
                    strong willed members of the communists placed blame for continued poverty on
                    those in charge.</p>
                <p>Supposedly, the Parchamists had strong ties with Beijing. In fact, I don't think
                    anyone ever proved conclusively that there was this kind of ideological tie. The
                    Chinese were certainly more friendly with one faction than with the other. The
                    Halquis, either by conviction or default, were considered more on the Soviet
                    side. But it wasn't very clear, at least to me. To me, both sides were of the
                    same coin.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>After the Saur Revolution, questions began to emerge about which faction would
                    take control. An effort toward a coalition government faltered and then fell
                    apart, as the several factions continued to squabble with each other. This
                    constant internal strife continued on during the later Soviet invasion and is
                    evident today, although with different players, even though the Mujahedeen
                    ultimately defeated the militarily stronger Soviet forces. Today the Taliban are
                    at odds with their former allies, as the unifying effect of a common front
                    against the hated Soviets was lost with victory. Afghanistan has always been
                    infected with factional fighting. The Afghans do things differently from other
                    nation states. They use the Koran as basis for conducting and resolving their
                    conflicts. That meant they had strict rules to their fighting.</p>
                <p>There is a little town that you can visit as you pass through from Kabul to
                    Peshawar in Pakistan. I drove back and forth to Peshawar several times through
                    the Khyber Gorge, a spectacular natural wonder that is unparalleled for rough
                    scenery. In contrast, the touted Khyber Pass is little more that a bunch of
                    rolling hills that had the good fortune to become the outermost limit of the
                    British empire and thereby was romanticized by generations of British writers.
                    In three frustrating wars, the British tried to subdue the Afghans and thereby,
                    prevent Russian influence on the subcontinent. Each time they were soundly
                    defeated. That defeat was perhaps as much from the difficulty of the terrain as
                    from the fighting effectiveness of the Afghans, but the result was the same, the
                    humiliation of the British Army.</p>
                <p>You have to go north through the Khyber Pass to reach the narrow roads and
                    multiple switchbacks that add a touch of adventure to the spectacular views. It
                    is as though one could drive up and down the mule trails in the Grand Canyon.
                    Particularly in the early or late hours of daylight, the canyons and rills were
                    particularly beautiful, even if the winding switchbacks were dangerous from
                    erratic busses and overloaded trucks plying back and forth to the border and
                    from falling rocks and an occasional herd of goats.</p>
                <p>A short distance outside of the Pakistani city of Peshawar to the south of the
                    Khyber Pass, there was a gate which was closed at dusk. It was a gate with no
                    fence flanking either side of it, and the road ran directly through the gate.
                    The act of locking the gate at sunset was symbolic rather than practical, as the
                    Pakistanis did not control the area next to the border, and it was a no-man's
                    land after dark. A small village at its midpoint was a bandit village called
                    Landi Kotl. It was said you could buy anything there that you wanted. You want a
                    DC10 tire? Next Tuesday they would have it. You want the latest refrigerator?
                    They would bring one in. Everything was smuggled.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Young Ne and I visited the town on one of our trips, escaping Kabul for the
                    cultural change from southwestern Asia in Afghanistan to the subcontinental life
                    of Pakistan. In Landi Kotl, people walked around the streets with bandoleers
                    similar to those you can see in the old western movies. All they needed were
                    sombreros, and they would fit right into the archetypal horse opera. They
                    bristled with guns of all sizes and shapes. Rumor held that if you could find a
                    picture of a gun in a magazine, a gunsmith in Peshawar could fashion a
                    reasonable likeness that performed something like the original. It was quite a
                    place. The Wild West in the middle of Asia.</p>
                <p>Everybody was armed in Afghanistan, and when the different factions would do
                    battle, they would always go to the mountains. It was against the rules of
                    Afghan warfare to fight in the villages or involve women or the children or the
                    elderly. The rules went so far as to stipulate that you never even involved
                    cattle. You never killed somebody's cow. You never fought in a person's home. So
                    if you were invited to an Afghan's home and he hated your guts because you had
                    killed his brother, he would be a wonderful host. As soon as you left his gate,
                    watch out, because he probably will put a knife between your ribs. But as long
                    as you were in his home, you were a guest. They have very strict rules.</p>
                <p>When the fight that swirled about the Saur Revolution spread outside the capital,
                    there was an incident in a mosque in a village south of Kabul. In the aftermath
                    of the struggle, into the village mosque strode a young, bright-eyed communist
                    cadre who pronounced, “All you old men get out of the mosque. This is going to
                    be a museum. We are doing away with religion.” The old men attending the service
                    got themselves up, grabbed him, cut his head off, and threw the body along with
                    its severed head into the river. Those in the revolutionary command in Kabul
                    evidently decided that they had to teach this village a lesson to intimidate
                    others who might have entertained similar measures to inflict on the new
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>Although I never had the full story, the commonly accepted version that was
                    passed from person to person was that the new revolutionary government in a fit
                    of anger dispatched jets to strafe the village to teach them a proper lesson.
                    Afghans at the time refused to believe that an Afghan pilot was at the controls
                    and guessed that it probably was a Russian pilot, for only a kaffir
                    (non-believer) could commit such a heinous act. Once the carnage became known,
                    it was as if an electric shock passed through the country. The purposeful
                    killing of villagers, women, children, elderly, and cattle was not done by even
                    the fiercest Afghan warrior. It was completely outside the code. It was not
                    Afghan. It matters little now just who sat at the controls of the offending
                    warplane, for the die had been cast, and the course of the eventual fight
                    against the new leadership and their atheistic supporters irrevocably
                    determined.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I had a young man on the staff who we knew was a communist. He was a very
                    talented graphic artist and a generally pleasant person who appeared to be eager
                    to learn and produce quality work for us. On that basis, I hired him. I didn't
                    care what his politics were as long as he produced the quality of graphics we
                    wanted. He would go to his political meetings and probably reported what he saw
                    and heard at work, but we didn't mind, since the messages we were sending were
                    intended as much for his coterie as they were for those who generally
                    sympathized with the West. On one of the mornings following the revolution, we
                    had managed to get the office back to semblance of order and one of my staff
                    came to me and reported that the young man was in one of the back rooms crying
                    and feared to be close to violence. None of the Afghan staff could get him to
                    quiet down.</p>
                <p>The reason was that, as a bright young college graduate and a nationalist to the
                    extent that an Afghan can be a nationalist, he had taken pride in the communist
                    revolution which he saw as taking back control of the country from the royalist
                    elite. That morning, he had been coming to work when he saw on the street what
                    he recognized as a Russian soldier in an Afghan army uniform. He became
                    distraught with the realization that this was not what they had fought for.
                    Their idealistic struggle had not been to turn it all over to the Russians. This
                    was a revolution upside down. He and others in his group had put their lives on
                    the line for those Russians! It destroyed the very fiber of his convictions and
                    violated his sense of justice as an Afghan. Through his tears he wailed, “This
                    is not what we fought the revolution for!”</p>
                <p>Afterward in my office, I asked the Chief of my print shop what he thought was
                    going to happen if the things the young graphic artist saw and the stories of
                    the jet strafing a village turned out to be true. He wordlessly shrugged his
                    shoulders and just stood there with his head cocked to one side, looking pained.
                    I pressed, “What are you going to do if the Russians stay; how are you going to
                    handle the Soviet pressure?” The Print Shop Chief who was also a head-man in a
                    small village in the outskirts of Kabul looked up and quietly drew his finger
                    across his throat in a silent threat to the Soviets who had violated his
                    religion, his tradition, and his people. He turned, and without further
                    explanation quietly left my office. For me, it was an encapsulated prediction of
                    what would take years of fighting and bloodletting on both sides to accomplish.
                    But that is essentially what happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The foreshadowing of the tragic Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the slow bleeding
                    of the Soviet forces in an unwinnable war, and the ultimate cutting off of the
                    head of the “Kaffir” Russian troops were summarized in the silently shrugged
                    shoulders and the finger across the throat. To my Print Shop Chief, it was
                    obvious. The Afghans have a creed: if you are wronged, you must redress the
                    injury, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. If you were wronged by any
                    member of another family or clan, the wrong must be avenged by a member of the
                    injured clan or family. The injury might be to someone you had never laid eyes
                    on, a distant cousin, but someone of the same blood had a debt of honor to repay
                    the wrong. When the Russians strafed that village, everybody who had relatives
                    who were killed, maimed, or injured was committed, regardless of their politics,
                    to redress the act. The effort to avenge the sin inflicted on Afghanistan had to
                    continue as long as one Afghan had the breath to continue the fight, and fight
                    they did to the everlasting regret of their Soviet tormentors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the 1978 revolt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Russians involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: While the incidents I recounted involving members of the Soviet military
                    were beginning to occur, the Soviet role at the time was on the sidelines,
                    supplying arms and giving moral support to their supporting faction. The Chinese
                    were also in the role of supporting the revolution, but either distance from the
                    action or a general wariness evidently kept them from a more direct role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Prince Daud's son, his wife, and children
                        were killed. What about the fact that they killed the wife and the
                        children?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>YATES: That's right. That act confirmed to true Muslims that these were
                    unquestionably “Kaffir.” Afghans believed that none of their kinsmen would do
                    such things. It is a society of harsh rules and similarly harsh penalties when
                    those rules are broken. Yet another example of this rigid code was played out at
                    our own house. We had two brothers who worked for us, doing chores and serving
                    as watchmen. The two were from the Panshir Valley, reputedly the toughest part
                    of Afghanistan and the bane of the Russian presence when they later took over
                    the country. Panshiris are born fighters and have a long history of real rough
                    and tumble.The two brothers had asked to go home once in a while to visit with
                    their families, so on alternating weekends one brother would go home, leaving
                    Friday night and returning the next Monday morning. We had to keep somebody in
                    the house all the time, because theft was a real problem, and a house untended
                    was an easy mark. One weekend, the younger brother, Mahmut, went home but failed
                    to return on the following Monday. Mir, the older brother, said that he did not
                    know where his brother was but not to worry, he would certainly be back the
                    following week. So we had one man left in the house that week, which meant he
                    couldn't leave, because someone had to be in the house all the time. The second
                    weekend came and went but still no Mahmut. I told Mir he should find out where
                    his brother was, because help was needed to watch the house. He tried to get a
                    telephone call through to the Panshir Valley, working at it all day. Finally,
                    his call got through, and after much animated conversation, Mir turned to me and
                    said he would have to go right then because his brother was in jail. I asked
                    what happened, and he said he was not certain. He went off in great haste and
                    much obvious worry.</p>
                <p>He was gone for more than a week without a word, so we concluded that the
                    brothers had to be replaced since we had an urgent need of help at the house. We
                    did not hear from the Panshiri brothers for more than a month. Finally one day,
                    the doorbell rang, and when the door was opened, there was the younger brother
                    Mahmut standing there smiling and requesting his job back. I replied that he was
                    gone for so long, how could he expect to get his job back. “Oh, yes, long story”
                    he grinned sheepishly. “What happened?” I pressed.</p>
                <p>As it turned out, he had gone back for the weekend, and during his stay, his wife
                    got into a fight with a cousin's wife over a coin found on the floor. They
                    started to shout and pull hair and ultimately drew the two husbands into the
                    fray. At some point, a large machete-like knife of the sort Afghan raisin
                    farmers use to cut grapes became a part of the fight. In the midst of the
                    struggle over the knife, Mahmut caused the end of his cousin's nose to be sliced
                    off. According to Afghan law, if you cause another to be maimed, it is an
                    automatic five year jail sentence with no questions, no trial, no lawyers.Mir,
                    the older brother, went back to find out what happened to Mahmut and to try to
                    get him out of jail. After arriving home, Mir was jumped by the members of the
                    maimed cousin's immediate family who proceeded to cut Mir's ear off. That act
                    balanced the earlier injury, so Mahmut was then eligible for release from jail.
                    Two wrongs might not make a right, but in Afghanistan, it can lead to a removal
                    of penalties. Everything was now settled. Mahmut was out of jail and Mir was
                    healing. Both of us felt sympathy for the plight of Mahmut and for the
                    well-being of his older brother, but by that time we had employed a replacement
                    and there was no job waiting. Mahmut understood but was very disappointed.</p>

                <p>About three months later, Mir appeared at our doorstep with a dark knit hat
                    similar to a ski cap pulled down one side lower than the other. Sure enough, he
                    was missing an ear. That is the level of toughness in that country. For some
                    reason, the Soviets either did not understand the code or choose to ignore it.
                    They did so at their peril.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Despite all this, the Russians kept their people at their
                        embassy there forever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, that is right. That is the big mystery. Either their communication
                    structure didn't work or they didn't want to believe. They had everything except
                    the flag, but insisted on that too, which drove them into a Vietnam-like
                    conflict. They were sucked into this thing and had no possibility of victory.
                    They would send helicopters into the Hazarajat, the center of the country. The
                    problem there is that the Hazarajat peaks are about 12,000 feet, and the Soviet
                    helicopters did not have the capacity to maneuver well in the rarified
                    atmosphere at that height. The problem was the Afghans with those old British
                    Garand-style rifles, not much improved over a long barreled musket, who would
                    sit on rocks on the tops of mountains, shooting down at Russian helicopters
                    which unfortunately had armor plating only on the bottom, assuming that ground
                    fire would be received only from beneath the flying aircraft. The Afghans with
                    their antiquated firearms were taking them out like flies in the Hazarajat.
                    There was another technique that proved remarkably successful for the
                    Mujaheddin. The Soviets would send a column of tanks and armored personnel
                    carriers up the mountain pass to bring unassailable force on the unruly
                    villages. The Afghans, in this case the Hazara, would simply wait until they got
                    into the interior a little bit and push rocks down on the pass behind them and
                    in front of them, so they were bottled up. Then the intrepid Afghans would sit
                    up on the rocks and wait. The sun would get higher and higher in the sky, and it
                    got pretty warm in those armored vehicles. As soon as a head would pop up, they
                    would shoot. So the forces in their otherwise impregnable vehicles died either
                    of thirst and starvation or from being shot when they came out. The technique
                    was a variation on the method used against the British with such effect in three
                    previous wars. The Russians couldn't get columns up the pass. They never did get
                    into the Hazarajat, and never obtained control over that part of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>It was an ugly war. A similar thing occurred in the vicinity of the Salang Pass,
                    a series of tunnels through the mountains at about 12,000 feet, connecting Kabul
                    and the southern part of Afghanistan with the northern part. The Afghans would
                    wait until the Russians got halfway through the tunnel and cause a landside at
                    both ends. Accounts of these exploits were frequent in the western press, but
                    the Russians had little choice but to move men and material over very few
                    roads.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The whole Russian involvement in Afghanistan was difficult to understand. I
                    remember sitting in a “Country Team” meeting chaired by Ambassador Eliot,
                    debating whether the Russians would invade. I was on the side that argued under
                    no circumstances would the Soviets directly enter the fray. They could not be
                    that stupid. Others argued that the Soviet-built roads ran north-south,
                    providing an easy invasion route, something the Soviets could not resist and
                    possibly the principal reason for constructing the highways in the first place.
                    Roads built with U.S. aid went east-west and completed the loop around the
                    periphery of the country. In any event, the roads running north-south go to
                    India and Pakistan, not to Afghanistan. I was convinced that the Russians would
                    not invade. It was a point not worthy of debate. The British had found that out.
                    I assumed that the Russians were sophisticated strategists, had long experience
                    in Afghanistan, and undoubtedly knew Afghan history well. But inexplicably, they
                    did enter. Perhaps the military command in the region took action on its own
                    without considering modern intelligence, or they had better intelligence on the
                    fractured alliances they held and decided to place a firm hand on the situation.
                    Nobody has ever explained to my satisfaction the rationale that led to the
                    Soviet foolishness. Maybe now that we have better relations, someone can dig
                    into the pertinent archives and come up with an adequate explanation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing I heard was how you had the geriatric group of
                        Brezhnev and his cohorts in charge and somebody got the bright idea of
                        teaching the Afghans a lesson. Nobody could figure out why they came in,
                        because it wasn't necessary at all. I think in 1979, there was another
                        little change-over in government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: There were some things, though, that were going on in Afghanistan that I
                    think the Soviets were unhappy with. For example, I mentioned before the IMET
                    (International Military Education and Training) program that the embassy ran.
                    The U.S. military attaches at the embassy were picking young colonels in the
                    Afghan air force and sending them to a base in the U.S. for a few weeks of
                    training. When they came back, they had remarkably different attitudes. These
                    were the brightest part of the Afghan military. They had a taste of something
                    entirely different from what they had known. Most had been Soviet-trained and
                    Soviet-equipped. When they went to the US, say somewhere in Kansas, they would
                    report to classes with American pilots. They would eat in mess halls with
                    American GI's and would be invited to the homes of Americans on the weekends.
                    They would celebrate holidays with others, go on picnics, hang out with their
                    American classmates, and were clearly a part of the student body.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>It wasn't that way in Russia. When the Russians trained the Afghans, they were
                    kept in separate barracks and not allowed to fraternize. Even when they went to
                    and from Moscow, which didn't happen very often during their training of one or
                    more years, they were isolated. On such trips, they had to pass through either
                    Tashkent or Mary, which necessitated an overnight stay. On arrival at the
                    airport, they were put into buses with the shades rolled down, taken to the
                    hotels, and locked in for the night. The next day, they were put back into the
                    buses and taken to the airport where they would depart for Afghanistan. The
                    Afghan ethnic groups extend across a wide region of the center of Asia and of
                    course, knew that they had relatives in those Central Asian cities. They had a
                    strong desire to meet their relatives but were not even allowed to see their
                    city of transit, never mind the relatives. So what was happening was these
                    young, smart, very carefully chosen Afghans, especially pilots from the Afghan
                    Air Force, were becoming very Westernized. I think the Russians felt they were
                    losing their grip on the best of the Afghan military. Although the IMET program
                    for Afghanistan was small and low budget, it was having a significant
                    impact.</p>
                <p>IMET is the subject of a lot of controversy. For example, when the Timor massacre
                    happened in Indonesia, Congress mandated that we kill all the programs that
                    supported the Indonesian military. One of the casualties was IMET. The military
                    fought very strongly to get that reversed. It argued that the people who went
                    into East Timor to try to straighten out the problem were the very people they
                    had trained in the IMET program. They were the good guys, the guys with the
                    white hats. By killing the IMET program, we were cutting off our nose to spite
                    our face. And that in fact is what we were doing. It was a reflex action, taken
                    ill-advisedly, because we did not have the sense to carefully weigh the
                    consequences of our actions at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: June, 1978.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: At that time, of course, the fighting was over. The revolution was over.
                    The Russians had not yet come in. There was much arguing among the factions, but
                    the ideologues clearly had taken over. The American Embassy had lost much of the
                    earlier close contact we had with the government. However, to me the
                    “revolution” appeared to be one of personal factions more than ideological
                    communist revolt. I have served in Beijing just after Tiananmen, Afghanistan
                    under communism, and visited the northern part of Korea after the death of Kim
                    Il Sung, but every one of those societies, at least in my view, is based
                    primarily on personal factions, not ideology. Ideology is the window dressing,
                    the veneer. The underlying causes and motivating factors in the politics are not
                    communist in the textbook definition. They are factional.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>If these states are looked at in that light, then I think it is easier to
                    understand why they do what they do. It is not very useful to run an analysis on
                    the dialectic and draw conclusions from it. It doesn't work. But explanations do
                    work if you consider factional dynamics, for these “communist” administrations
                    most closely resemble feudal states in their attitudes and functions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: I think it may be useful for your readers to hear something about the
                    media that were in Afghanistan, particularly the foreign media that we were
                    working with at the time. As I mentioned before, I was Information Officer in
                    Kabul, and there were a couple of incidents that illustrate how the foreign
                    media work in Afghanistan. There were no foreign media based full time in
                    Afghanistan. Rather, a number of major American newspapers and news services had
                    correspondents based in Delhi. Every time something happened in Kabul, they
                    would come rushing in on the next flight. Some of them were very good; others
                    were not so good.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I met Bill Borders of the New York Times in 1977. He was fairly new to the
                    foreign service of the Times and was assigned to Delhi. He strongly distrusted
                    government officials, particularly American officials. I recall when he came to
                    my office for the first time, he was stiff and formal, and certainly very
                    non-committal, as he stated he just wanted to let me know he was in town in case
                    something happened to him but wanted no assistance even if it was offered in
                    good faith. His attitude was one of suspicion and mistrust. I was a government
                    official, and he was a member of the press who did not deal with U.S. government
                    officials. Whether this was a product of a suspicion of all government officials
                    or simply a high-minded journalist wary of being corrupted by a slant or special
                    message, I never was certain.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A brand new reporter out of the Vietnam generation more or
                        less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. Bill was young at the time. He was a good correspondent, had a good
                    reputation, and was bureau chief of the New York Times in Delhi. I felt sorry
                    that he thought that somehow he would lose objectivity if he were to associate
                    with U.S. officials. He left the office after giving notice that he was in town
                    and proceeded into the wilds of Afghanistan on his own. At the time, such a
                    presumptuous action was very chancy, because Afghans didn't trust foreigners in
                    any case, that is unless you had something they wanted, and that situation did
                    not arise very often.</p>
                <p>I guess he went around banging on doors in Kabul, looking for contacts and the
                    information that would give him the desired hook on which to base a story. He
                    clearly did not get very far with that approach. Not long thereafter, he came
                    back to my office, not quite with his tail between his legs, but almost. I had
                    offered to help him if he needed any introductions, but at the earlier time, he
                    was not interested. Yet he came to the realization that the natural suspicions
                    of the Afghans were stronger than his resolve to remain unsullied by U.S.
                    government officials, and he did come back. We were able to open some doors for
                    him in the foreign ministry and get some real solid stuff.</p>
                <p>A savvy reporter, he knew enough to realize that he needed basic information
                    about Afghanistan and see that he would need someone the Afghans trusted to
                    vouch for his own need for information. Of course, once he established himself
                    as a reliable and careful reporter who was willing to listen and not abuse his
                    sources, the Afghans accepted him directly, and he was able thereafter to move
                    independently about the capital. Even though he achieved that degree of
                    independence, he came to accept that the U.S. officials in Kabul had their uses.
                    Every time he came to Kabul, the first stop he would make was to us to talk.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>As his trust grew, he learned to rely on at least some of the information U.S.
                    officials could provide as background for his visits in town. During some of the
                    stressful times, he would come in and use our typewriter to draft his copy. Bill
                    Borders was one of the best reporters to travel the Kabul beat during my time
                    there. I would read his copy as it appeared in the Times, and his observations
                    always rang true. Perhaps that consonance with what I knew to be true resulted
                    in part from his consultations in the embassy that provided a foundation of his
                    later work on the street.</p>
                <p>Other reporters who, like Bill, were particularly tuned to events in Kabul and,
                    therefore, were almost always accurate and perceptive in their copy included
                    Sharon Rosenhause of the L.A. Times, who also was based in Delhi at the time.
                    She did not have the need for as much briefing as Bill Borders, since she had
                    been in Delhi a longer time and knew more people in the Afghan capital. Most
                    often, however, the American press was at a disadvantage there, because they
                    didn't have very many contacts.</p>
                <p>One of the stories that I remember well, illustrated the relative lack of
                    expertise of the American press, bound together with a dangerous enthusiasm in
                    the pursuit of a story; it involved Barry Schlacter of the Associated Press.</p>

                <p>YATES: No, I do not believe so. Delhi was an important post. It was a major
                    branch covering a large part of a very complicated part of the world. Delhi was
                    a serious assignment that usually included the whole subcontinent and contiguous
                    areas. All together, it constituted a very large area and some of the most
                    heavily populated parts of the world. This broad area and convoluted problems
                    placed a degree of stress on those assigned there and some complained of the
                    constant travel and lack of hard information.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I recall one telling me he hated the work. I asked him why, and he said every
                    time he plans something with his family, he gets a call and he has to be gone in
                    ten minutes. He always kept a bag packed, was rarely home, and felt that his
                    wife considered him out of his mind. One occasion he related was especially
                    bitter. He and his family had planned a barbecue in Delhi for many friends, and
                    just as things were getting under way, he was called away to chase another
                    story. He left his wife behind to cover with his friends and very disappointed
                    children. Such occasions made him yearn for a return to the U.S. and a more
                    steady lifestyle. The life of a foreign correspondent was especially rough.
                    Perhaps domestic reporters encounter something of the same problem, but not as
                    large. Languages were not a part of most foreign correspondent's training or
                    background, and they flew blind most of the time. Every time there is a fire
                    storm someplace, the foreign correspondent has to scramble for the next airplane
                    without knowing what conditions will be on arrival or when a return home will be
                    possible. It is a tough job for them. Some did it well and some not so well. It
                    is testimony to their skill and perceptive abilities of the best that anything
                    remotely resembling an accurate interpretation of the news ever sees light of
                    day. Of course, not all correspondents were as successful as Borders and
                    Rosenhause in taking the time to carefully puzzle out the real story.</p>
                <p>Sharon Rosenhause was a very fine correspondent who had a special advantage. Her
                    copy was wonderful, but others wrote well also. The fundamental difference was
                    that she had a very large news hole in the L.A. Times. To enable the paper to
                    separate the incredible number of ads in each edition, the editors needed as
                    much good copy as they could get. She was able to take the space to expand on a
                    subject enough so that the reader had a chance to come to a better understanding
                    of the complicated political and economic situations that confronted governments
                    in the area. Borders, and others like him working on papers such as the New York
                    Times, were forced to submit very concise articles to fit very limited space for
                    international news, and there were some who always complained about their
                    editors taking articles and slicing them to bits.</p>
                <p>While I have no real proof, I harbor a strong suspicion that much of the
                    misinformation that is foisted on the American public is the result of heavy
                    handed editors who consider the politics of the story more than the truth of the
                    interpretation. That may be a bit harsh, but most of the time I found foreign
                    correspondents had a healthy curiosity, and a special talent for writing fast
                    but reasonably accurate copy. It was the editors who twisted the analysis to fit
                    the available space or dropped on headlines that were not supported by the
                    information in the story, at least as it was originally filed. Again, this may
                    be unfairly critical of editors of foreign news who are expected to be expert on
                    almost every corner of the world and make considered final decisions on what the
                    American public eventually reads as accurate information about foreign issues.
                    Such a Herculean task possibly can never be met with total success, but I would
                    be reassuring if editors of foreign news exhibited a bit more humility about
                    their essential tasks.</p>

                        about another reporter.</hi>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>YATES: Barry Schlacter was a young, backpacking sort of reporter. He would come
                    into Kabul and stay at those 50-cent-a-night flop houses where a lot of
                    Australian backpackers stayed when hitchhiking from Australia to Europe to see
                    part of the world and get a cheap ride to jobs and freelance. These news hounds
                    cluster together in the cheap hotels and will chase almost any lead to carve out
                    an exclusive for themselves</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They do this. This is their once-in-a-life-time adventure.
                        They go away for a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: They were all over the place. They would stay in these flop houses. Drugs
                    were easily available at very low prices, so if you enjoyed that culture, you
                    were in great shape in Kabul. I cannot say whether these people were in the
                    business for the adventure of far away places, the easy drugs, or the feeling
                    that they were “one of the people”. Maybe they were finding a better view of the
                    local society by staying with others who were foreigners and generally
                    out-of-the-main-stream individuals, lost in the movement between continents and
                    stability. Perhaps we will never know.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Barry would arrive in Kabul and leave sometimes without any notice or
                    seeming schedule. He showed up just after the Saur Revolution which we talked
                    about last session. Right after the heavy fighting stopped and the dust had
                    settled a bit, he moved out to find the pulse of the new political arrangements.
                    He was very aggressive in his objectives and worked his way into interviews in
                    the mosques. Of course, religion in Afghanistan was a very touchy thing. The new
                    government was avowedly atheistic and had decided that mosques had to be shut
                    down, because they were disruptive to the ideas of the people. Schlacter ended
                    up in Jalalabad, a border city to the south of Kabul near the Khyber Pass. There
                    he went into a mosque and was talking to some of the mullahs about their
                    thoughts on the revolution when the government picked him up. Some of the army
                    troops in the area heard about it and arrested him. They brought him back to
                    Kabul and after some “hot-potato” handling, he was deposited at the Ministry of
                    Defense.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>This immediately became a problem for the Afghan government, because by
                    international convention, they had to notify the American Embassy of the fact
                    that they were holding an American on some sort of charges. As Information
                    Officer who had charge of the press, I was called upon by the embassy to search
                    out the errant reporter, see him, and attempt to get him released. The
                    revolutionary government was uncomfortable working with the American government
                    or perhaps any other foreign government, because they were brand new. They
                    didn't know what to do with this reporter whom the Army had perhaps too quickly
                    arrested and brought back to Kabul. While they dithered about who was going to
                    handle the problem, they passed him from one ministry to another in a game of
                    musical chairs. When one phone call seemed to indicate that he was at the
                    Ministry of Defense, that would be denied by claiming that he was at the Foreign
                    Ministry. In turn, the Foreign Ministry would say that no, he was not there,
                    “maybe at the Ministry of Interior?” Repeated phone calls were made and some
                    visits, but I could not find the elusive reporter. This charade dragged on for a
                    couple of days with nothing to show for the effort.</p>
                <p>Finally, I got one of the translators from the embassy and said, “Look, we have
                    to put a halt to this. The only way we are going to do this is to do essentially
                    a physical demarche.” We got into a car and drove over to the Ministry of the
                    Interior, which was Schlacter's most recent stop and where, we had reports, he
                    had been seen. I walked into the ministry and was ushered into an office where
                    there was a very nervous officer behind a desk. He said, “Well, maybe we have
                    him.” So, I sat down and said to him, “Well, find him and get him here, because
                    I am not leaving until he is brought here and we have a chance to talk.” So
                    there my interpreter and I sat. We faced the deeply discomforted officer from
                    the sofa across from his desk. The poor man was in a prickly situation and was
                    at a loss as to what to do.</p>
                <p>Here he had an official of the U.S. government, together with a translator
                    sitting in his office, both refusing to move. He couldn't arrest me, as the new
                    government obviously had to keep relations with the U.S. straight, even though
                    the U.S. did not have strong relations with either the new, revolutionary
                    government or the parties that participated in the overthrow of the old. Either
                    his instructions were incomplete, or he was out of the loop, for the officer on
                    the spot did not admit that his ministry had Schlacter. He was in a very sticky
                    place. He talked incessantly on the phone, but mostly in a whisper or facing
                    away from his two antagonists. He began to sweat profusely. This stalemate
                    persisted for about three hours. Reports were always that they would work it out
                    and get back to us right away, if we would be patient and leave. I responded
                    they had been doing this for two days, and I wasn't going to move. We had to
                    resolve the situation before we would move.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>After about three and a half hours, a beaming Barry Schlacter was dragged into
                    the office and they said, “Here, take him.” Schlacter was amused and evidently
                    pleased that he had real first-person copy of an incarceration and release of an
                    American reporter. For him, it was a wonderful story, and he was happy to get
                    his own exclusive. As in other times, the reporter became his own story. But
                    those of us at the embassy had worked about three days on this missing citizen
                    and were decidedly less pleased with the process. However, American reporters
                    abroad must be considered first as American citizens and should receive as much
                    of the protection as anyone else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely. Did you have any impression of the
                        coverage and how reporters from other countries operated, like Japan for
                        instance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: They would operate out of their embassies essentially. It was the only
                    point of contact they had in town. Afghanistan had not been a hot bed of
                    interest until the revolution, and then everything broke open, but most
                    reporters could not get in. They were constrained by the flight schedules of
                    Afghan Air and other airlines serving Kabul. After the revolution,
                    transportation became erratic, so it was very difficult for them to move around.
                    It was possible to get across the border near Peshawar, but that meant you had
                    to have ground transportation or a big pocket full of money, so you could bribe
                    yourself across the border. The officials were notorious for giving hard times
                    to those who were looking for an exception or something to happen quickly. After
                    the revolution, crossing the border became suddenly much more difficult,
                    especially for reporters.</p>
                <p>I don't know what the Japanese press was saying, but the American press was
                    uneven. Some people were very good, very insightful, like Bill Borders who
                    worked very hard on his copy and Sharon Rosenhause. They were the best. Others
                    were less so; on a sliding scale that went way down to writing not very much but
                    the anecdotal and were of rather limited use. The American public is not very
                    well served by its press, unless their people abroad have experience in the
                    history and culture of the society being examined. They tend to follow whatever
                    rumors there are. The most famous rumor that surfaced during my tour in
                    Afghanistan was the death of the Shah of Iran. That was during the period in
                    Iran when the Shah was in power. BBC, AFP, and a host of other primary European
                    organizations would regularly broadcast the death of the Shah. At that time, of
                    course, the Shah was very much alive and still involved in the political life of
                    Iran. There were rumors about cancer, and they eventually proved correct. Yet
                    the press did not do a very good job, since the rumors that were broadcast were
                    put out, evidently under pressure to be first out of the blocks on the story,
                    and it was the public that usually ended up confused.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>As with the vitality of the Shah, Afghanistan was not very well understood. There
                    was a language barrier that could not easily be overcome. Additionally, there is
                    a significant cultural barrier in the sense of antagonism on the part of the
                    Afghans wanting to be left alone and not interested in seeing their story told
                    to the world. They rejected what they perceived as interference from the
                    outside.</p>
                <p>The media were always a problem. I can recall earlier when I had been in Teheran
                    for a study of the American Center there. I remember having a conversation with
                    Gordon Winkler, who was the PAO then. We were discussing how difficult it was to
                    talk to Iranians. One of the principal worries of the U.S. Embassy, at that
                    time, was the attitudes of the mullah and the rest of the religious community.
                    The embassy felt that they were almost completely out of touch with members of
                    the religious sects, and they were an important political force in the society.
                    We really had no means to get to them. We knew there was a problem. We simply
                    couldn't get through. They were not listening; they tuned us out.</p>
                <p>It was ironic, of course, that the mullah were the ones who came to power shortly
                    thereafter. There was much beating about the ears of the U.S. government for not
                    understanding and knowing of this; actually the government had a pretty good
                    understanding of the problem, but lacked a means by which it could address this
                    special difficulty. So one of the things I tried to do in Afghanistan was to get
                    to know people in the Ministry of Information. The Ministry of Information, at
                    that time, had control of mosques and religious propaganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the mullah were a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I remember sitting in the director's office of the Ministry of
                    Information. He was a known communist but beleaguered, because the mullahs would
                    have nothing to do with him. He controlled their newsletters and their nominal
                    means of communication, yet could do little to bring them under his control. He
                    frankly admitted that it was almost an impossible task. His observation was that
                    many of the mullahs were not intelligent, and those with intelligence most often
                    had little formal education. To be a mullah does not mean you have to go to
                    school. You simply show up at the mosque and pray a lot and after a while you
                    are recognized as somebody and are declared a mullah.</p>
                <p>Anyone can declare himself a mullah who wishes to become a member of the faith.
                    That means they can preach at will, and they do. Their preaching was not always
                    scientific in his eyes, nor was it enlightened. They purposefully paid no
                    attention to the director at all. So it wasn't just the U.S. government that had
                    a problem with the mullah and the religious community; their own government had
                    serious difficulties. He would sit and sort of cry on my shoulder about how
                    difficult it was. It was an interesting sidelight of how other governments don't
                    always work as efficiently as we give them credit for.</p>

                </p>
                <p>YATES: There is one other aspect of my time in Afghanistan that might be of
                    interest. Part of the job of the Information Officer was to handle, not only
                    American press reporting on the country, but also other members of the American
                    media community who would show up in Kabul. The most notable one of those was
                    Otis Chandler who at the time was chairman of the board of the Times Mirror
                    Corporation of Los Angeles - Sharon Rosenhause's boss, I guess. He came to
                    Afghanistan to do big game hunting. The mountain sheep that were in the hills
                    are a rare animal, one of a number of endangered species, and they only live
                    from about 12,000 ft up. You had to get up at least that high to find them.
                    These are the sheep with the big, curling horns. There are very few left in the
                    world, so the Aghan government at the time had a program of allowing big game
                    hunters who paid about $10,000 apiece to come and hunt them. Only several
                    licenses were granted each year, and Otis Chandler had one of them.</p>
                <p>He showed up in Kabul with an Alaskan dentist and one other person. They were a
                    three- man party. It was a very elaborate scenario. He first came to Kabul and
                    stayed for about a week and a half before moving with the party up to the
                    mountains to get acclimated. Kabul is about 5,000 ft, so he was staging himself
                    on the way up. He had been preparing for this hunt for a long time. The team had
                    all bought specially crafted rifles with special materials which would not be
                    affected by the extremes of temperatures or altitudes where they were going to
                    do the hunting. They were beautiful, dark, long, big rifles. The team had to go
                    up with a doctor, oxygen, and supply train, all of which was supplied by the
                    Afghan government within the $10,000 fee. The government guaranteed nothing.
                    They were allowed one sheep apiece if the hunters were able to find the sheep
                    and get them in their sights. That was their limit. It was entirely possible
                    that they would go home empty handed.</p>
                <p>While Otis Chandler was in town, I thought it would be a good opportunity for him
                    to meet some of the Afghan media. After all, here was the chairman of the board
                    of one of the world's largest media corporations visiting Kabul. I took him
                    around to meet the different notables in my contact group among the Afghan
                    press. The Afghan press isn't very big and the smallest paper at that time was
                    Hewad, essentially the communist mouth piece in Kabul. Despite its eventual
                    strength in Afghanistan, communism, at least nominally, didn't elicit very much
                    interest among the people. Hewad was the government newspaper and was
                    distributed by the government. Few ever read it. The man who was the
                    editor-in-chief of Hewad was a poet.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>I was taking Otis Chandler around to meet all these people, and he was very
                    patient with everybody, speaking to them with a disarming editor-in-chief to
                    fellow editor-in-chief manner. I brought Chandler into the office of the editor
                    of Hewad. The editor was not a stupid man; he knew who Otis Chandler was. He was
                    floored. He could hardly speak, stuttered and was embarrassed. You could see
                    this man who was in his office, about ten by fifteen, with kind of rickety
                    chairs and not much of a newspaper. And here was Chandler talking to himwell,
                    you are editor-in-chief, what is your circulation, talking about technical
                    things, how large a staff do you have, etc. We only spent about half an hour
                    there, but the effect of that visit on that man was just profound, beyond my
                    wildest imagining. He had always kept contact with me, even though he didn't
                    have much of a circulation or influence, but after that, he was very, very
                    friendly to those of us from the media on the U.S. side, even though he was
                    ideologically opposed to us personally, because we had done something like that
                    and treated him as one of the select few in Kabul. I think he appreciated that
                    more than anything else we could have done. I don't know whatever happened to
                    him. He was not young at the time. This was before the revolution. I suppose he
                    survived because he was a communist.</p>
                <p>The root of the story is that Chandler could have been very arrogant but wasn't.
                    He played it straight on a person-to-person basis. Those kinds of contacts that
                    USIA has been able to put together all over the world had an incredible impact
                    over the years. Sometimes you set these things up, and you don't know what is
                    going to happen. You don't have a plan for this; it is simply another check of
                    the editors-in-chief in town. The result was just an incredible impact on this
                    man's outlook towards us as a people and the American press in general.</p>

                        your job there?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>YATES: I was charged with overseeing the theory and operation of the Japan
                    program. At the time, Japan had five branchesSapporo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuokaand
                    Tokyo. My job was the Country Plan; I made the initial draft of it each year. I
                    handled all the public opinion and other research done by the post and also
                    handled the growing use of computers. In Japan at the time, we were just getting
                    into the computer age. While I was there, I installed a WANG VS-100 computer; it
                    was state-of-the-art at that time. Because space in the Tokyo embassy was at a
                    high premium, we had to locate the major works of the computer, the central
                    processor and the large disk drives, in a converted closet along one hallway. At
                    the time, the hard disks each occupied a device of its own and had
                    interchangeable disk packs with a stack of “platters,” each about a foot and a
                    half in diameter and stacked about eight high like pancakes. It was not as
                    powerful as a main frame of the time, but it was not too much different. It was
                    a serious computer and permitted a large number of terminals.</p>
                <p>In Tokyo, USIA was going to be the “lead agency,” as it was termed, for all
                    computers for the different sections in the embassy. The chief reason for that
                    arrangement was that USIS had the initial interest and me, who had some
                    experience in computers. So we got the original assignment to provide services
                    for all. The Wang VS-100 we installed was to provide such service for the entire
                    mission. The embassy was a ten story building in downtown Tokyo with about 20
                    different U.S. government agencies, such as the FBI, IRS, State, Defense, USIA,
                    etc. All of us were going to work on the same computer. That was at least the
                    theory in the beginning. So I wired the whole building, including
                    communications.</p>
                <p>After we got this thing running, I thought it would be a good idea if we could
                    hook up with communications directly and thus be able to send cables from my
                    desk as it were. I was told that could not be done. “Why?” was my question.
                    “Because we have a classified system.” The classified system was housed on the
                    top floor of the embassy and was inside a vault like installation to provide
                    maximum security. All that was needed was to connect my VS-100 through the wall
                    of the vault and I could then fully wire communications for the embassy. Such an
                    arrangement ran into difficulty, however, for I was told, “no, you can't connect
                    a black line to a red box.” The red box is classified and the black line,
                    unclassified. I argued that it should work fine and that, technically, there was
                    no problem at all. We would only use an unclassified circuit, we would have
                    unclassified control, and there shouldn't be any problem. “No, it is technically
                    not possible,” came the response. I thought that was funny, because we used to
                    have a thing called USINFO, an unclassified channel that used old teletype
                    equipment in USIA. That system was stand-alone, but we were able to receive
                    messages in the normal telegraphic traffic. It was mixed in with all the
                    classified traffic.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>USINFO was the original USIA network which was devoted to press materials, post
                    advisories, and other unclassified items. It was slow but serviceable, a sort of
                    bridge between the real “wireless” file that used to be broadcast from VOA relay
                    stations around the world and the later computer-to-computer transmission that
                    is now used. USIA posts around the world still used USINFO to receive longer
                    messages such as press stories, long articles for placement or translation, and
                    the usual internal messages such as transfers, admin messages, and the like.
                    USINFO was handy to keep bulkier traffic away from the usual telegraphic
                    channels.</p>
                <p>We used to get USINFO messages regularly, and a dependable flow was important.
                    Many posts without alternate technical means would receive USINFO traffic via
                    the usual telegraphic channel. Knowing that was possible, I stood my ground and
                    maintained that the “red” and “black” channels could coexist. I said, “You CAN
                    connect a classified network with an unclassified one, and I can demonstrate
                    that to you.” The communications technicians were adamant, “No, you can't. That
                    is completely out of the question.” Asking them to just wait a bit, I said I
                    would send a message to myself now and come back to the 10th floor to pick it
                    up. They thought I was crazy.</p>
                <p>I then went downstairs to the basement where we had a USINFO terminal and punched
                    in a message to myself. Since our traffic contained a large number of USINFO
                    messages in the telegraphic flow, it was easy to pick up an example with the
                    appropriate addresses. After I had completed my keyboard work at the aging
                    terminal, I returned to the 10th floor and asked for my message. Humoring me,
                    they checked the received traffic, and sure enough, there was an unclassified
                    message amid the classified incoming. I now had demonstrated proof of the mixing
                    of the “red” and the “black.” Once more, I asked that the connection between my
                    computer and the communications panel be made, so that I might enable
                    telegraphic transmission and receipt directly from each desk.</p>
                <p>While surprised, the communications people refused to budge but were curious
                    about how such an unbelievable mixing was possible. The story was a bit
                    convoluted but simple. The USINFO terminal is in the basement of the embassy.
                    The connecting line was an old U.S. Army 75 baud circuit which ran to the old
                    Sanno Hotel down the street. The Sanno Hotel was a U.S. military R&amp;R
                    facility and it, in turn, was connected to Camp Zama. Of course, from Camp Zama
                    via Hawaii, communications were connected to the Pentagon which maintained a
                    bridge to the State Department's communication system, and - voila - all the
                    U.S. embassies around the world including Tokyo. That is how the simple typed
                    message I sent from the basement arrived instantly on the 10th floor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Camp Zama was the American army headquarters in

                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>YATES: Right. We later found that if we could get an address in the large
                    worldwide cable system, we would be able to use that simple USINFO terminal as
                    the basis for connections world-wide. That would permit me to connect my
                    computer on the second floor of the embassy with the worldwide cable system. I
                    discovered that the Department of Agriculture had an extra address it was not
                    using and I could get it. Yet I ran afoul of a technicality, because the speed
                    of the USINFO line was too slow at 75 baud to be able to match up with the rest
                    of the network. The minimum speed to be acceptable on the network was 300 baud,
                    and the U.S. Army would have to upgrade its circuit to the embassy from 75 baud
                    to 300 baud. This involved the purchase of a $200 modem. They were not willing
                    to do this for our benefit since such older lines were being phased out wherever
                    possible. I was never able to get the connection.</p>
                <p>In reality, the Department of State really did not want to see such direct
                    communication enabled, because someone would be able to sit at his desk and send
                    messages directly by computer, transmitting them to any embassy in the world
                    over the State Department network. While the whole e-mail system was technically
                    feasible at that time, the problem was internal controls. Who would see what I
                    said? Who would clear what I had to say? This promising project floundered. The
                    technical people rejected it in the beginning, saying it wasn't possible. When I
                    showed them that it could be done, they got very bureaucratic about it, and the
                    promise of convenient and instantaneous communications, the stuff of e-mail
                    today, never had a chance. I thought this was too bad, because I thought at that
                    time we could really do something interesting in an unclassified environment
                    which would allow us communication with our other posts all around the world.
                    This was in 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just across the pond in Korea about this time, and
                        we were just experimenting with a WANG computer there. It was pretty
                        primitive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That time was very interesting. One of the other things I had to do,
                    because of my computer connection, was oversight responsibility for our mail
                    system, addressing, which in USIA is called “DRS,” the Distribution Record
                    System. I had control of that in Tokyo. One of the problems with our DRS was
                    addressing. In Tokyo, we had to use Chinese characters (Kanji) that are commonly
                    used in Japanese addresses, particularly for names. People would use the
                    phonetic syllabary, “kana” in combination with Kanji for everyday Japanese text,
                    but because of the large number of homonyms in the Japanese language, the kana
                    system is used primarily for inflections on verbs and simple connectives. For
                    such things as names and addresses, you need Kanji, which are based on
                    ideograms, and therefore carries a much more complex meaning than the kana. At
                    that time, Kanji-based language was beyond the relatively simple machinery of
                    the Wang VS-100, at least in addressing programs, and therefore made it
                    necessary to contract our address system out. We had no Kanji printing
                    capability in the embassy itself. I discovered, though, that computers were
                    starting to come into their own, and there were some programs available back in
                    the U.S. that might be able to handle our printing needs from there.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>In particular, I found a connection to a GE node in Beltsville, Maryland that was
                    being operated by the Japanese advertising firm, Densu, and they had a
                    multiplexed connection to Tokyo working 24 hours a day. What we would have been
                    able to do was to dial up a local number in Tokyo and get access to the GE
                    computer in Maryland. This would have been much like the Internet operates
                    today. In turn, they would connect us with our USIA headquarters here in
                    Washington, and we would be able to exchange data plus use the large variety of
                    programs that were online in Beltsville. They had a Kanji printing program that
                    Dentsu was already using.</p>
                <p>The basis of my concept was to do the processing in Beltsville and then, download
                    a print file to us in Tokyo where our address labels would be produced. The
                    advantage of this was economic, since the Japanese contractor was rather
                    expensive and through this process we would have full control in the embassy in
                    Tokyo. International computer connections were a relatively new phenomena, and
                    the Dentsu network was not being used that much. The whole process promised to
                    be a lot cheaper than the contracted services then in use, and we would have the
                    added benefit of all of the software that was otherwise not available to us in
                    Tokyo. As it turned out, we ran into all kinds of problems.</p>
                <p>This seems silly now, in light of the vast amount of personal data that is
                    available on the Internet, but at the time, we were worried about transborder
                    flow of information on individuals. We had a name list that, at the time,
                    included what we were sending them, when those materials were sent, plus a
                    record of when a given person attended a program with us. This enabled us to
                    maintain contact with our audience and have a better grasp about our
                    effectiveness. The target audience in Japan, at the time, was broken down into
                    different pieces. At the center, was a small group of about 300 whom we spent a
                    lot of time working with. These were key people in the media, economic
                    institutions, and the government that we wanted to talk with about U.S. policy
                    or simply to mail background material to them.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, we had a much larger group of individuals that we would invite to
                    programs and send materials to but would not devote much personalized time to.
                    These included junior professors, younger reporters, people who were coming up
                    but had not yet arrived. They were not members of our “core audience” but were
                    important to us, nonetheless, and certainly were a part of the audience we had
                    to maintain contact with. So we included them on name and address lists.
                    Altogether, we had about 15,000 in the data base for those sorts of individuals
                    throughout Japan.</p>

                <p>The operation of the DRS systems always was a controversial topic. Our local
                    staff members helped but were sometimes suspicious, believing that we probably
                    were feeding data collected about individuals back to Washington where it would
                    be used in intelligence or other conspiratorial needs. Of course, nothing of the
                    sort was done, but the more efficient the system and the more productive it was
                    for guidance, the higher the level of local suspicion and anxiety. Some felt
                    uncomfortable with the possibility that personal data on Japanese was possibly
                    being passed outside the country. For most, it was generally all right to keep
                    such information in Tokyo where our local employees had their hands on most of
                    the processes. Efficiencies, such as those offered by the Dentsu arrangement,
                    were understood, but the discomfort was palpable. Technically, it was feasible,
                    and essentially, we had it all set up. All we had to do was sign the contracts
                    to implement a system which, in a limited fashion, would have looked like the
                    Internet does today. Of course, few show much concern about trans-national flows
                    of information today, but at that time, it was a serious problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This time in Japan, 1978-82, from your polling what were
                        your particular concerns? Whither the Japanese public vis-a-vis the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was an interesting question. There were a number of Japanese polls,
                    the largest being the Jiji poll which had been done for many years. There is
                    what's called trend data available through the Jiji poll, because they have had
                    the same kinds of questions asked over very many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Japanese firm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, it is. We would do contracts with the office of research, because I
                    had been in the office of research before and my policy job in Tokyo included
                    research responsibilities. On occasion, I would contract for questions in
                    Japanese polls. For example, “What do you think of the American policy?” “What
                    do you think about the US-Japan-Security Treaty?” The interesting thing was that
                    we could take the results of these published polls and with the new Wang
                    computer, do some reprocessing for results that were important to us. Most
                    important was trend data, looking at similar questions over a longer period of
                    time. The Jiji poll was particularly useful. Mainichi Shimbun and the Yomiuri
                    Shimbun ran similar polls, as did most major Japanese news organizations.</p>
                <p>In the aggregate, the poll data on US-Japan relations over the years revealed the
                    basic trends in Japanese thinking on the relations between the two countries. By
                    analyzing data using a technique called regression analysis, you can condense a
                    variety of information into a single graphic representation and reduce
                    uncontrollable variation to reveal the fundamental change in the data over
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>A good example of this was Japanese impressions of America and its relations with
                    the power that had defeated it in the Second World War. For some data, if you
                    looked at it in the short period, you found dramatic rises and falls. This
                    related directly to the events of the day and the nature of the newspaper
                    headlines at the time of the poll. However, if the same data were combined with
                    that from other polls and the data were examined over a longer period of time
                    through the technique of regression, then in a period of about 10 or 15 years,
                    you found a gradual increase in the favorable attitude of the general
                    population. There was a lot of press commentary saying Japanese-American
                    relations were going down the tube or was at one extreme or another. The
                    revealed truth in longer period analysis was that the Japanese view of America
                    was fairly stable and positive.</p>
                <p>Yet every time there was an incident, such as when a U.S. submarine hit a
                    Japanese trawler, our poll numbers went down sharply. That was in reaction to
                    individual events. When you plotted significant international events in
                    Japanese-American relations, you found they very closely correlated with the
                    mood swings of the Japanese public. But if you did a regression analysis over a
                    longer period of time, it turns out there wasn't much change at all. That was an
                    interesting lesson for those who watch polls here in this country, the famous
                    one being the Dewey/Truman election. They looked at the spikes and didn't look
                    at the trends.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself almost odd man out? Here you were
                        playing with computers in an era when they were just beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: In USIA, computers for some were bad words, as it was throughout the
                    government. I think USIA probably was more receptive to most of this new stuff.
                    Yet for an ambitions Foreign Service Officer, a connection with computers
                    probably had a negative effect on his career. While I believe that the effect of
                    using computers to assist in communication programs had an enormous impact over
                    the years, I don't think I got much credit for it. It was considered out of the
                    mainstream of what a traditional Foreign Service Officer was concerned with. So
                    I tended to get odd jobs. I built the first audience record system in Korea that
                    was based on computer principles. That was in 1968, when I first entered the
                    Foreign Service. I had previously had a lot of computer experience while working
                    my way through university, so the development was a natural one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the bank?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes. So I had a base of operational knowledge to work from. When I arrived
                    in Korea, they were struggling with organizing data about the audience and
                    programs. Every officer would have a Rolodex on his desk or at least a business
                    card file, and it was on that basis that contacts were developed and managed.
                    The Deputy PAO at the time was Mort Smith, and he had within his
                    responsibilities managing this audience. I suggested we do something with
                    punched cards. We didn't have a computer and could not afford one - but punched
                    cards were available. I told them we could do a “key sort” system, which is
                    based on very primitive physical computer principles.</p>
                <p>I drew up plans for a key sort device on a piece of paper and got a local vendor
                    - literally on the street - to build it out of wood. It involved a box into
                    which we put cards which rested on a trap door on the bottom. Also on the
                    street, we located an umbrella repair man and bought umbrella staves from him.
                    We used these as the needles for the key sort system and designed a card that
                    had holes around all the sides. We got a company to drill the cards. You put the
                    person's name and something about them, what kind of audience, academic,
                    government, media, etc.. We coded the area, their interests, etc. We would then
                    use a mechanical punch to cut through from the drilled hole to the edge of the
                    card. Each card could then be coded with notches which opened the hole to the
                    edge. If you put the pin-like staves through the holes pertaining to what you
                    wanted to find out, those which had a punched out notch in the appropriate
                    location would fall from the rest of the cards when the trap door was opened.
                    This was a primitive card sorter. We then would put the selected cards in a
                    mimeograph-based printing machine and printed the name and address onto a piece
                    of paper which you could use to wrap materials to be sent to the audience. Then
                    you put the cards back in the box. Next time you would pick a different group of
                    holes.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>YATES: It was old at the time, but it was good enough to get us off the ground
                    with a machine based system without any real cost. The interesting thing was, in
                    order to make this work, we had to get the information and the names and
                    addresses. That was quite a problem in USIS at the time, because people on the
                    staff were not organized for information with that in mind. We had a Cultural
                    Affairs Officer who was very distinguished and who had very warm and close
                    contacts with some important members of the Korean audience. When the call went
                    out from the Deputy PAO, Mort Smith's office, to give their names and addresses
                    to me for my “machine,” this particular Cultural Affairs Officer resisted the
                    concept. He considered his contacts his own and was very reluctant to have them
                    shared with anyone else.</p>
                <p>There was a real row in the post about that. He was ordered to give his list to
                    me, and it turned out after all the fuss, he had only about seven names. Whether
                    it was out of indignation over the order to turn over his private set of
                    contacts to the general staff or masking his embarrassment that he had so few
                    genuine contacts, I never was sure, although I did suspect the latter.</p>
                <p>The key sort system was a precursor which had become outdated, as you pointed
                    out, and it did not last very long. There were physical problems. First off,
                    there was the problem of transferring the addresses from the cards to paper.
                    Sometimes, not all the cards would drop out; you really had to shake the box
                    hard. The mimeo-based system was clumsy and new cards had to be re-done after
                    only a few uses, because the chemical deposit on the surface of the card wore
                    down to the point that it no longer gave an image adequate for the postal
                    authorities to read.</p>
                <p>I heard that the U.S. Army declared some card sorters surplus at Camp Zama in
                    Japan. Under the U.S. procurement system, if any element of the federal system
                    has equipment that is declared surplus, any government agency can lay claim to
                    it before it is put up for sale. So we got the army to agree to give us a card
                    sorter. We had to modify it, because Japan ran on an electric current of 100
                    volts and 50 Hz. That conversion accomplished, we brought it to the office. We
                    then had to punch cards with a key punch which we got locally. We could then
                    prepare standard IBM punch cards, and it then became a real system. We could
                    process a much larger number of audience members and could sort cards quickly to
                    meet desired criteria. One disadvantage to a key sort system is, you can select
                    but you can't sort; you have to do it mechanically unless you do it through a
                    series of selections and then it is all screwed up and you can't put it back in
                    order again. The old IBM card system was much faster. We got it installed, and
                    although it still used a mimeographic address transfer system to prepare
                    selected address lists, it ran for many years after I left.</p>

                        technical side which we have already discussed, were their any other aspects

                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>YATES: I ran the research part, which was important, because we used the
                    information we developed to govern the use of our resources. Even then in the
                    late seventies, resources available to USIS were declining. There was a question
                    of how many cuts we could take and where to focus our resources. We stepped back
                    and took a look at the physical facilities we had in Japan. How could we best
                    use these facilities to reach a maximum number of people with the greatest
                    amount of information that was going to have the direct utility to them?
                    Questions raised concerned personal contact versus direct mail, versus
                    invitations, versus radio (such as the Voice of America), versus libraries.</p>
                <p>The problem of libraries was one of the biggest questions. A book was quite a
                    large investment, and you are never certain anyone is going to read it. However,
                    you are fairly certain people will read direct mail and can often make an
                    assessment based on direct feedback. So we had to make such relative
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>A controversial one was how many people could be effectively addressed with this
                    multimillion dollar program in Japan? We did the math backwards. We went back to
                    individual officers, asking how many hours a day an officer could spend with
                    people, given the usual office mix of administration, meetings, and the other
                    mechanics of operating in a large organization. Put in a different way, how many
                    people within their assigned duties would they be able to know well? The level
                    of personal intimacy was important. Could you possibly know something about a
                    contact's kids or his wife, and be almost on a first name basis (which you don't
                    do in Japan)? Could you be on a level of friendship with a person, so they would
                    trust you when you went to them with something that was important, an issue they
                    were concerned about? How many could you accommodate on that level? We looked at
                    this really hard, did a lot of talking. We came up with a number, about 30
                    people that, on average, could be handled at the defined level of closeness.
                    This would be 30 people they could really get to know, to be functional
                    with.</p>
                <p>If you multiply that 30 by the number of American officers we had in Tokyo, you
                    came up to something like 300 people. That became a very problematic figure. The
                    30 individuals for each program person thereby defined the “core group” in the
                    DRS. For our bean counting critics, the charge might be, “You mean you are
                    spending $5 million a year (or whatever we were spending at the time) on 300
                    people?” This would be leveled by congressional staffers who looked at our
                    program in Japan. “You can't do that. You have this big operation and you are
                    only talking to 300 people? That is outrageous.” On the other hand, if those
                    were the right 300 people in Japan, it would be worth putting all of our
                    resources onto them. But that, of course, is not the way people look at things
                    in Washington. The earlier PPBS (Program Planning and Budgeting System) was
                    tried in earnest, but was not in place so very long. Neither was “Zero-Based
                    Budgeting.”</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Real or imagined questions soon got out of hand for each of these systems. Some
                    asked to assess the value of the operation, based on how many people saw your
                    movie, or attended programs, or visited the library. Under PPBS, I remember
                    during my time in Korea we would show movies to assembled audiences containing
                    all sorts of people. For example, we might show three movies to 50 people in one
                    sitting. What was our contact? The total reported under PPBS was 150, but I only
                    had 50 people attending. The formula we were requested to apply asked for a
                    count for each screening. One film shown to 50 people counted 50, but three
                    films shown to 50 at one time counted 150. How this could quickly get out of
                    hand seemed obvious, and there was no assessment of the quality of either the
                    audience or of the impact those films had on their viewers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Carter administration came in, there was a great
                        deal of emphasis on the zero-based budget, too. This was the buzz word of
                        the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That's right. This was not the first time and downsizing (although we
                    didn't have that word then) was very much alive in Japan in the late '70s. We
                    were talking about cutting branches and reducing the budget by 15-20 percent.
                    One of the things I had to do was to look at the program and make suggestions
                    for where we might cut at various funding levels. If we got a 5 percent cut,
                    where would the axe fall? If we got a 10 percent cut, what would be eliminated?
                    Twenty percent cuts were unimaginable, but we were forced to consider the
                    possibility. From one year to the next, we never knew what we were going to have
                    in the next budget. It was a silly way to run a railroad, and much of the time
                    spent in such sterile exercises would have been much better spent in developing
                    contacts or better programs.</p>
                <p>One of the most strongly attacked parts of the system was the libraries, because
                    collections of books absorb an enormous amount of resources in staff, plant, and
                    investment - you had to keep your libraries current. Technology was changing
                    libraries a lot even then. Microfiche was a buzz word. It is probably gone now,
                    replaced by computers, but at that time microfiche was a big fad in library
                    science. So the question was, do we buy a lot of microfiche materials for our
                    libraries? If so, how do we reduce our book collection in order to offset the
                    cost of the new materials and the associated readers? We had a library in every
                    one of our centers, absorbing about a third of our budget. The question was,
                    were they paying off with a third of the return?</p>
                <p>The simple answer was “no”. The complicated answer was “maybe”. The presence of
                    the library in a community gave an institutional face to the whole operation. It
                    would be difficult to justify in local terms having a government operative in
                    their midst going to universities, if he is a propagandist passing out U.S.
                    government brochures. But if he is the director of the library, that is good,
                    because that is passive and something people want to have, a resource for the
                    community. Few wish to strike up close relations with someone whose only
                    justification is to sell a point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>However, if you are the head of a library, a source for learning and students,
                    you are accepted, even welcomed. So as cachet, a way of defining ourselves in
                    the interest of the communities, the library is very valuable. But that is hard
                    to convince somebody who runs a budget. The libraries cost x number of dollars.
                    How many people use them? We had to keep statistics on how many people walked
                    through the doors, but that didn't indicate what they read. Even those who came
                    to our programs held in the library were counted. It was a real game.
                    Unfortunately, at that time we were examining our navel on this one without
                    looking at the larger questions and understanding them and being able to
                    articulate them to those making the decisions in Washington. We just did the
                    numbers and aggregated the numbers worldwide. Later, Charlie Wick's “billions of
                    people watching TV in Europe on Worldnet,” was the illogical result of what was
                    supposed to be a scientific approach to the problem. The logic and its science
                    were flawed and led to a flawed conclusion. Instead of looking at the context,
                    they were looking at the volume and that wasn't very useful.</p>
                <p>While I was in Japan, we did another thing with our new computer. One of my
                    duties there was to help people apply new technology to make our traditional
                    programs stronger. We knew the library system needed a shot in the arm. First,
                    on our new WANG VS-100 we created an interlibrary loan system, so that all of
                    our library holdings could be accounted for centrally. If someone in Fukuoka
                    wanted something on a particular topic, foreign relations in the U.S. or the
                    Korean war, he could ask the librarian in Fukuoka what was available here in
                    Tokyo, as well as all the other branches in Japan. That meant we could reduce
                    our holdings countrywide. Maybe Osaka would be a center for trade, Sapporo, the
                    center for American history, etc. We could specialize our libraries, and we
                    would then have to buy only one copy of a “must have” title. This would save us
                    some money. I did that in COBOL at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: COBOL being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Common Business Oriented Language. That is the old fashioned stuff that
                    has for the most part disappeared or has been transformed into the “C” or “C++”
                    programming language and now has returned to being so much in vogue because we
                    are trying to get the year 2000 (Y2K) problem straightened out. I programed the
                    new inter-library loan system with something like 5000 strings of code to
                    provide reports and other data for the different branches. We would periodically
                    update them.At the same time, we had another problem with our libraries: to get
                    people to use them. If you are going to survive in a period of cuts, you must
                    keep attendance numbers up. We devised a direct mail “outreach” system, a way of
                    making the target audience aware of what we had available. In the traditional
                    approach, you make up a list of materials and send it out to your library
                    patrons. That wasn't good enough, because we didn't have enough library patrons
                    who were members of the all important “core group.” That group was generally too
                    occupied with business or government to have time to visit our libraries, so
                    were not members.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Therefore, we created an outreach system where, instead of sending out a list on
                    American history, for example, to all on the library patron list, we chose
                    instead to approach only those we thought most interested in the subject. Our
                    full country audience was about 15,000, but obviously, not all would be
                    interested in American history. Maybe 50 or 100 at best. American History is a
                    narrow field, particularly in Japan. On the other hand, we may have had 4000 in
                    our target audience who would have a special interest in the discipline of
                    economics.</p>
                <p>Since our DRS was categorized by topical areas, we were able to ask the libraries
                    to make up a list of recently received materials (no more than 15 or 20) in a
                    certain subject area. They would decide what good materials they had in that
                    areanew books, new magazines, etc. We then used our WANG VS-100 to find out how
                    many people in our audience had an interest in the selected topic. Once we had a
                    workable number of individuals to “target” for the selected materials, we would
                    send the instructions to a contractor who, with the specially prepared form,
                    would list the selected materials and mail the announcement to those names
                    topically selected.</p>
                <p>The recipient would then look over the listed materials, select up to an allowed
                    four, and return a tear-off portion of the form to the nearest USIS branch for
                    them to respond with the indicated items. The return reply form was postage paid
                    and, once torn off from the listing, would fold up into a format that was
                    acceptable to the Japanese mails. On the reverse side of the completed return
                    form was the original mailing address, so the only part the recipient would have
                    to complete would be the check-off blocks indicating which of the items he or
                    she desired. Completing the form by the recipient was designed to be fairly
                    quick and easy, so as to minimize the effort needed to complete the process.
                    Within four or five days, they would get an envelope back with the ordered
                    materials.</p>
                <p>For example, suppose we wanted to do something on our trade imbalance with Japan.
                    Once a topic was decided, within 14 days we would have completed an entire
                    cycle, including the target group selection, addressing, mailing the outreach
                    announcement, the response by the recipient, and the return of the ordered
                    materials. Of course, once the topic and materials were selected and the
                    contractor put to work to mail out the announcement, we would reproduce the
                    listed materials in sufficient numbers to cover the anticipated response and
                    send those copies out to the branches, depending on their proportion of the
                    target audience. We were able to use drivers and other people who were not
                    working on immediate tasks to receive the responses and assemble the orders.</p>
                <p>Thus, the materials would get to the target audience in the shortest time
                    possible. The assumption was that if we could respond in a rapid fashion, the
                    person ordering the materials would still remember his or her request and
                    therefore have a better chance of actually reading the materials than one to
                    whom the materials were sent blindly.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>We got an average response about 15 percent for each of our mailings and
                    sometimes it was as high as 20-30 percent on economics. But that was very high.
                    It meant that we were getting primary material that we had selected into the
                    hands of people that we had selected. This is a fairly high average rate for
                    unsolicited materials, but because we had carefully selected the target group as
                    one which we knew to be particularly interested in the materials, our high
                    success rate could be explained.</p>
                <p>We did not bother people with materials they did not want. Ideally, each time the
                    recipients found the outreach flyer in their mail, they would be conditioned to
                    recognize it as something they would be interested in. If they were not
                    interested in American history, they would not get anything on American history.
                    If they were not interested in the environment, they would not have to read
                    that. But if they were interested in economics, they got the economics
                    material.</p>
                <p>The whole outreach process revealed a couple of other things. It quickly showed
                    that our libraries were not always up to speed in those areas with the highest
                    priority in our country plan. The country plan now applied to the libraries. We
                    were beginning to get the pieces of the program to fit together under this
                    single outreach, or “alert,” as we called it in Japan. I don't know if it is
                    still running, but it did run for a good number of years. It was very easy to
                    do. It didn't involve very many people. It involved one librarian, at least, who
                    would develop a list of materials. It involved writing up those materials in a
                    summarized form, typing them into the computer, and sending them over to the
                    contractor with the characteristics of the audience wanted; the contractor did
                    everything else. They even mailed the alert.</p>
                <p>A blank form, which was the frame for all “alerts,” was pre-printed and on hand
                    with the contractor. Only the printing of the selected names and addresses and
                    the special list of materials was necessary before it could go in the mail.
                    Then, all we did was to reproduce all the materials and make sure the branches
                    had enough, so that they could then distribute them directly to the audience
                    when they mailed in their requests. The mail cycle of addressing and mailing
                    gave us enough time to reproduce and distribute on the first cut. The stuffing
                    of envelopes was done in each branch and mailed directly to the audience in its
                    area. After the order was received, the clerk who stuffed the envelopes would
                    separate the order form into two parts, that with the actual order and the part
                    with the return address of the person who did the ordering. The original
                    target's address did double duty. It was used with spray-on adhesive to address
                    the package of materials, so we could avoid the additional work needed to
                    address the envelope to the target member. The remaining piece of the original
                    order form had printed on it the membership number of the target recipient and
                    the actual order form on which the ordered materials were selected, so we had a
                    full record of the transaction to keep a running tally of our effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal problems USIA found in dealing
                        with the Japanese where we wanted to try to get them to understand our
                        position?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>YATES: Among a variety of trade problems were the major items of beef and
                    oranges. We had a citrus problem in Japan. The Japanese grew their own citrus,
                    called “mikan” - a small, very sweet tangerine, and prohibited or prevented,
                    through tariff and non-tariff barriers, the importation of American citrus
                    products. American beef was not imported into Japan. While beef was an important
                    U.S. agricultural product, the Japanese would not buy American beef, because
                    they had their own beef industry. Japanese “Kobe” beef was very expensive, and
                    they didn't want to have competition from the grass-fed American beef, because
                    it tasted better and was a heck of a lot cheaper. The Australians were selling
                    flank steak to the Japanese, which also was much cheaper than Kobe beef that was
                    raised on imported grain and sometimes hand massaged to increase the fat
                    content. So we had those two major trade problems.</p>
                <p>We also had the automotive imbalance, of course. At that time, Japanese cars were
                    getting hot in the US, and they were making enormous strides in sales of
                    automobiles, while we were doing nothing in Japan, mainly because of what were
                    non-tariff barriers. For example, a shipment of General Motors cars came to
                    Yokohama but were all impounded at the dock and could not be released for sale.
                    The reason was the amount of light in the rear lights that leaked between the
                    area of light that was the brake light and the area of the light that was not
                    the brake light. Under Japanese law as interpreted by the customs officials,
                    that was not allowed. The problem had nothing to do with the safety of the car,
                    its reliability or its value. It was purely a non-tariff barrier which the
                    Japanese customs people could use at the port of entry.</p>
                <p>The folks at GM had no idea such a law existed but had to retro-fit all the
                    imported cars with a special gasket in the taillight to prevent light from
                    leaking from one chamber to the other. This example is indicative of the kinds
                    of things that we were up against. A similar kind of tempest in a teapot also
                    occurred regarding “medfly” on U.S. apples going to Japan.</p>
                <p>In addition, we had a military problem. About 32,000 American GI's were resident
                    in Japan, principally in Okinawa. There was a constant battle over the presence
                    of those GI's and their tendency to get into trouble in the social life that
                    tends to swirl around military bases. We had a training site on the side of Mt.
                    Fuji which was always a sensitive issue, because Mr. Fuji was considered to be a
                    Japanese national symbol and we were shooting artillery shells into the
                    mountain. That, of course, raised sensitive feelings, particularly on the part
                    of the Japanese who were uncomfortable with our presence.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>And then there was the problem of noise generated by military aircraft. This was
                    a special problem at those bases where carrier aircraft were moved when a
                    carrier was in port at Yokosuka. Since those large ships could not conduct
                    operations while in port, pilots would have to maintain flight status and keep
                    up training schedules from alternate sites. Of special concern was night flying.
                    Military emergencies may occur at any time, day or night, and the pilots needed
                    night flying experience. However, the people who were aroused at 2:00 am by the
                    roar of the jets taking off and landing at Yokoka Air Base or other military
                    bases could not be expected to be sympathetic to the military need. American
                    military aircraft don't have the noise abatement fittings that commercial
                    aircraft do. As housing developments pressed closer and closer to U.S. military
                    installations, the problems increased.</p>
                <p>If that was not enough, there were nuclear problems as well. Over the past
                    several decades, nuclear power became increasingly prevalent in major American
                    ships. The Japanese had a nuclear phobia and were unhappy with American nuclear
                    powered vessels showing up in their ports. The Japanese' three no's - no
                    production, no holding, and no use of nuclear weapons - were a symptom of this
                    particular nuclear phobia. They would give us a lot of trouble on that, and
                    there was always a question of whether American warships that visited Yokosuka
                    were carrying nuclear weapons. The Japanese had the right to ask, but chose not
                    to, thus most times successfully avoiding the problem. But those were serious
                    questions.</p>
                <p>Perhaps you remember the soybean incident during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,
                    when he cut off the supply of soybeans to Japan? The soybean and its various
                    products represent an important staple in the Japanese diet. Tofu, for example,
                    is made from soy, and everybody uses soy sauce in Japanese cooking. Some
                    Buddhists and other vegetarians eat practically nothing but tofu. When Japan is
                    not self-sufficient in soybean products, and when, during the Carter years, it
                    was decided to stop supplying Japan because of official pique over trade
                    difficulties, the Japanese went into shock. They realized how dependent they
                    were on outside sources for something that was very, very important to their
                    diet and did not like the feeling of insecurity.</p>
                <p>A related issue is rice. American rice is very good - as a matter of fact, in the
                    opinion of some, better than Japanese rice in terms of taste and quality.
                    However, in Japan with arable land at a premium and rapidly diminishing because
                    of the pressures for housing or other more profitable uses for open land, rice
                    production sharply declined. Perhaps in part because of the shock of the soybean
                    crisis, the Japanese attitude toward self-sufficiency in rice became much more
                    rigid. They clearly felt that something so vital for national survival should be
                    fully supplied from domestic production. That led to very high price supports
                    for rice farmers and an astronomical cost of rice in the market. U.S. rice was
                    much cheaper, but the Japanese felt deeply enough about the problem to continue
                    to pay a very high premium for their rice simply to avoid a situation where they
                    would be beholden to foreigners for the supply of such an important staple. The
                    import of rice was completely banned.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>The extremes to which this particular paranoia could be taken can be found in the
                    prohibition of the import of wild rice. While a grain, wild rice is not rice but
                    a completely different product that the Japanese do not grow. Still, since it
                    contained the term “rice” in its description, it was fully banned as an import
                    into Japan. For a long time, the prohibition against the importation of rice has
                    cost the Japanese taxpayer dearly. Politically, however, the Japanese voter
                    accepted the burden as the cost of retaining “food independence” and to avoid
                    the national embarrassment that the soybean shock had created.</p>
                <p>Those were the principal issues that faced the bilateral relationship during my
                    tenure in Tokyo. From time to time, other minor things would come and go as
                    immediate issues. Nonetheless, we had definite public affairs problems, all of
                    which were to be addressed through the methods I have describedthe outreach, the
                    alert system mailings, the DRS to design the audience around these issues, so we
                    could target the Japanese press and media.</p>
                <p>Not all of the problems in Tokyo were of a bilateral nature. One special kind of
                    experience occurred when a CODEL (congressional delegation) came into town.
                    CODELs came and went through Tokyo all the time, and they were always playing to
                    their home audiences while they were in Tokyo. A congressman from the mid-west
                    would come and have no interest in what the Japanese were thinking, but only in
                    what impression his constituents might receive while he was in the news from
                    overseas. Ostensibly addressing the international press on international
                    questions, he would actually be speaking, not to the press in Japan, but to his
                    constituents back home. That always led the Japanese to great seizures of angst
                    about “what are the Americans saying now? Is this a trial balloon? What are they
                    trying to tell us?” We would explain to Japanese journalists that we were trying
                    to tell them nothing. This was simply a Congressman on a junket in Japan but
                    talking to his or her folks back home. So don't worry about what he says, and
                    particularly do not take what he said as indicative of the attitude of the
                    American government. The Japanese didn't understand this and always felt they
                    were missing something.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>One time, Steve Solarz from New York came into town. We got a call from the
                    embassy political section one afternoon, saying that Congressman Solarz was in
                    town staying at the Okura Hotel and wanted to see me, because he understood that
                    I had poll data on Japanese opinions. I asked what information he was interested
                    in, and he said he wanted to see the data. I responded that I could pull
                    together all the information on a specific subject and save time for him, but he
                    insisted he wanted to see all the data in its raw form. I had about six large,
                    bound books of data, so I picked them up and took them to the Congressman's room
                    at the Okura Hotel. I sat for a couple of hours in Solarz's hotel room while he
                    went through the books page by page. I was dumbfounded. Once in a while he would
                    ask a question. He was an intelligent, careful observer of this information and
                    was actually reading the data with an analyst's eye. For me, this was a
                    revelation, because I had never expected a member of the American Congress to be
                    interested or capable of absorbing information at that level. Whether or not
                    this was the best use of his time was a bit beside the point. He evidently
                    wanted to see the raw data unedited and undigested by others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am interviewing Steve Solarz now, mainly on Africa. His
                        way of operating was to go to a place, have people lined up for him, and
                        then he would also talk to other people. He would vacuum up everything.
                        During the period I am interviewing him for now, he was chairman of the
                        subcommittee on Africa; then he went to the subcommittee on the Far East.
                        But he could talk with tremendous knowledge, because he talked to everybody
                        and did the things you are saying. So he was able to draw on real data and
                        real contact. Sometimes he could be a pain in the ass, because he wanted to
                        be everywhere, but I think he was also respected, because he did what you
                        are saying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Although I spent a lot of time in the Foreign Service, I had only the
                    slightest contact with American Congressmen. Solarz, with his evident hunger for
                    straight data, was an exception. Of course, the reason was that I had the data
                    he was interested in. I did have respect for Solarz, although there were a
                    number of CODELs that I had no respect for.</p>
                <p>One such instance occurred while I was in Afghanistan. Lester Wolf from New York
                    came to Kabul. An interesting man. My recollection is that he was only there
                    about six hours. He was interested in drugs, illicit narcotics. The embassy had
                    made several discoveries in the area of interdicting narcotics and had come to
                    an arrangement with the Afghan government on the means to handle such
                    investigations. They held announcement of the new arrangements off, to wait for
                    his arrival so that he could attend a show and tell about the progress that was
                    being made. At the news conference, he said, “I came to Afghanistan, and despite
                    all these bureaucrats, I broke the log-jam in the narcotics problems here in
                    Afghanistan.” Such a grab for the glory that was based on the hard work of
                    others did not endear him to the hearts of the people who had done so much to
                    make it possible for him to be a part of the final success while he was in
                    town.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>That kind of offhand treatment of Foreign Service and other officials working
                    abroad is something that happened very, very often. I saw congressmen and even
                    their staffers coming through, using embassy resources and then spitting on the
                    people who had done so much to help them and made sure their visit was
                    successful. Following an overseas visit where every effort was made to make
                    their visit productive and comfortable, members of the Congress would turn
                    around and criticize imagined standards of living abroad or such things as the
                    “booze budget,” the funding needed to provide receptions and food to visitors on
                    such occasions as the Fourth of July. They simply were feeding stereotypes at
                    home to make it appear that they were champions of stringent budgetary
                    guidelines, but the cost of one CODEL far exceeded representational events where
                    real governmental business was transacted to the benefit of American business or
                    the taxpayer.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were people in the government who were not like that. In the
                    Carter administration, there was Jodie Powell, whom I had some association with
                    while he was at the G-7 in Tokyo. Normally, when a presidential visit would
                    occur, we would have to supply materials, and everybody in the embassy would
                    take a different part of responsibility. In USIS, one of our responsibilities
                    was to prepare Wireless File materials, a news service we provided to the
                    mission. Included in the Wireless File were summaries of public opinion in the
                    host country and of world events in other areas. The basic service was to keep
                    the presidential party abreast of what was going on and what the local press was
                    saying about the visit. Naturally, USIS would also handle incoming foreign press
                    and briefings and interviews.</p>
                <p>Powell was particularly good, because he was accessible. Each day, I would put
                    together the local media reaction plus wireless file materials and get it over
                    to his office. He worked in the basement of the Okura Hotel, which was a hotel
                    next to the U.S. Embassy, so it was easy for us to access. He had a windowless
                    office in the basement, about 7 feet by 8 feet. A very small office, it had just
                    enough room for a desk and a chair. He was always in this office reading. The
                    rest of his people often were pushy and insufferable. But he was smart, capable,
                    knew what he was talking about, didn't waste time, and was always respectful of
                    people who were trying to help him. That was very important for those of us who
                    were grinding out the information.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, some of the advance people, in particular, were not very
                    smart. Political advance teams that come out, even for presidential visits, are
                    not always the best and brightest. They were often campaign workers who were
                    given an overseas trip as a reward for their campaign work. I recall one member
                    of the advance team for the Carter visit to Japan that was supposed to be at the
                    airport at a certain time; embassy officials couldn't find him. They were
                    supposed to go to the airport, bring him in, brief him, and get him set up for
                    his work. He had disappeared in Tokyo. After an exasperated search, they finally
                    discovered him in Tokyo.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>The story was he had gotten to Narita, gotten off the airplane with his backpack,
                    and went into the terminal to find transportation into the city. Not knowing
                    that he would be met, and evidently not appearing to be of presidential advance
                    team caliber to those who were tasked with meeting him, he checked the cost of a
                    taxi to Tokyo, which was astronomical, and the fare for the airport bus, which
                    was evidently too much as well. So he hitchhiked along the expressway back into
                    Tokyo. He put out his thumb out and got a ride. The great amount of effort spent
                    to track him down because of his ignorance of how things are done created much
                    frustration, a quick spreading story, and did little to encourage respect for
                    the incoming presidential advance team.</p>
                <p>There was another incident with the Carter advance team at the time of that
                    visit. As usual with such trips, the President had one schedule and Rosalyn
                    Carter had another. One of the things she was going to do was visit Kyoto and
                    one of the gardens there; I believe it was Ryoanji. The young lady responsible
                    for that part of the trip traveled to Kyoto to set up the visit. She took one
                    look at the stone garden and said this would not do. She wanted carpeting put on
                    the rocks, so that when Rosalyn came and walked out into the garden, she
                    wouldn't slip on the rocks. It took a lot of tall talking to get the advance
                    team to understand that this would not be something that would be possible,
                    because of Japanese sensitivity to the aesthetics of the location. The advance
                    team fought long and hard on that principal, but finally relented when it became
                    evident that the Japanese and the embassy, would not budge.</p>
                <p>During the visit, Carter was to make a major speech on economics. Somebody in the
                    bowels of the White House wrote the speech. I don't know who it was, but he or
                    she knew nothing about Japan, its culture or its sensitivities. Luckily, we got
                    an advance copy, took one look, and knew it wouldn't fly. In the last hours
                    before the speech was given, we had to literally rip the whole thing apart and
                    rewrite from sentence one, because it was so crudely written. One wonders how
                    the government manages to keep things connected at home. On the road, it is
                    evident that things fall apart quickly.</p>
                <p>When we have had important officials abroad, more than a few times the saving
                    grace has been some poor guy sitting out in the brush who knew the situation and
                    could say, “No, no, don't do this. You are going to screw it up.” As we downsize
                    and shut facilities, as we remove people, there are fewer and fewer experienced
                    people to do this, and the logic would be that we are going to make more and
                    more mistakes, as, I guess we did, on the recent trip to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Carter got hit by the press at least twice. Once was in
                        Poland and another time was making a remark about Montezuma's revenge in
                        Mexico City. Neither went down very well.</hi>

                <p>YATES: You have to have somebody with local ears, local eyes, and local feelings
                    to be able to say “Don't say that,” or “I think, Mr. President, that isn't quite
                    what you mean,” and correct it on the spot. If you wait for three days, you are
                    lost. You do a lot of damage and negate a lot of the effort that has gone on and
                    millions of dollars that were spent to try to get people to understand American
                    policy and attitudes. And, more importantly, to understand that the American
                    people have respect for people in that country. A presidential slip, a gaffe by
                    one who is speaking for the American people, can undercut a lot of good will
                    that has been established. Maintaining goodwill sells American products, which
                    means American jobs back home, and builds our own reputation abroad as an
                    important place in the world. So as we are shutting down, we are losing this

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Japan is different, light years away from Korea. During my time in Japan,
                    I went over to Seoul on consultation only once. Since I had been in Japan for
                    some time and other places before that, I had lost my sense of the Korean
                    environment. When I stepped off the plane, it was immediately apparent. You
                    could just feel the difference, a sense that the air is different. The reason, I
                    believe, is in the attitude of the people. The Japanese don't feel comfortable
                    with physical contact. They aren't comfortable with a relationship that gets you
                    too close to their personal lives. It is all right to have an official
                    relationship, and they are very happy with that and are wonderful friends, but
                    if you get too close on the personal side, they are uncomfortable, because you
                    don't fit into the Japanese scheme of things. For example, there have been many,
                    many books written on the difference between the Japanese and other culture's
                    business practices, and these are best sellers in Japan so that their readers
                    may feel more comfortable when traveling abroad.</p>
                <p>Koreans, on the other hand, are physical. They are in your face. They are much
                    more open and you can joke and carry on - to a point - with a more relaxed
                    feeling than you could in Japan. On a Seoul street, you get bumped into and no
                    one will say, “I am sorry.” In Tokyo, it is a great crisis. If they bump you on
                    the street, they bow and are very apologetic. A Japanese friend and I had formed
                    an international club, the International House. We brought in speakers from
                    different embassies and had a cultural exchange. He was a very quiet and
                    personable man and has since died of a heart attack.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Before I left Japan, he invited me to lunch to say goodbye. It was a nice,
                    pleasant restaurant at one of the smaller hotels in Tokyo on a side street. We
                    were sitting eating, when all of a sudden I crunched down on a piece of glass in
                    my rice. I put it on the side of my plate and ate the other things. My friend
                    asked, “What is the matter with the rice?” I replied, “I think there is glass in
                    it.” “We probably should say something or someone else may be hurt eating the
                    same rice.” So he called the waiter over, and he asked what was the matter. “My
                    friend here found glass in his rice,” he said. The poor waiter almost fainted on
                    the spot. He picked up my plate and rushed off to the kitchen and bedlam ensued.
                    The chef, the restaurant manager, the hotel manager, waitresses - everybody on
                    the staff - suddenly appeared, bowing and almost knocking their heads on the
                    floor saying, “This is unacceptable. We run a good restaurant and are deeply
                    sorry.”</p>
                <p>In fact, my friend got away with a complete free meal, because when we left,
                    there was no charge. The whole staff turned out to say goodbye in the parking
                    lot and once again apologize. There was a great intensity in everyone's
                    apologies. In a good American restaurant, the waiter might say, “I'm sorry, I
                    will bring you a fresh dish and you will not be charged,” and you might even
                    receive an apology from the manager. I would not expect the entire staff to turn
                    out in a display of contrition. But in Japan, there was an extreme sense of
                    embarrassment. My friend said if we had not been cordially treated, we could
                    have simply picked up the phone and called the health officials in Tokyo, and
                    they would have come and closed the restaurant, because an infraction of that
                    type could cause a serious health problem if left unaddressed. A much less
                    dramatic but similar situation can be seen if you buy something in a Japanese
                    store. The clerks spend minutes wrapping up a relatively cheap purchase. The
                    Japanese do things with a different sense of aesthetics and responsibility,
                    which I think is sometimes surprising to westerners who are accustomed to a more
                    casual approach to service. But the Japanese consider it important and
                    necessary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you wife feel about being Korean in Japan? Was
                        this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. One of the dark sides of Japan is that they are not as racially
                    tolerant as most of rest of the world. This is true for much of Asia. We had a
                    problem when I was in Kwangju with the black GI's. In the late '60s, American
                    blacks felt they were deeply wronged in the US, and if they could only get
                    outside of this country, things would be okay. We had black GI's at the air base
                    in Kwangju who would go off base, thinking they had finally gotten away from
                    this racist society and run right smack into a racial antagonism which was far
                    deeper than anything they had encountered in the US. It caused severe
                    psychological problems for the black GI's in Kwangju and the military brought in
                    a psychiatrist to handle them. The military were very uncomfortable, since at
                    one time, they had a policy of not sending any black GI's to Korea because of
                    the racial tension, but that was no longer an acceptable course of action. Korea
                    had not changed, however, and the problem persisted.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>A similar effect could be seen in Japan. The Japanese are more sophisticated,
                    perhaps, because there is a basic cultural attitude not to confront people or
                    things directly. This leads to the image that all is fine. But under the
                    surface, there are powerful feelings that have deep cultural roots. The Japanese
                    do not like Koreans, and the feeling is passionately reciprocated. Up until very
                    recently, they fingerprinted all ethnic Koreans resident in Japan, even though
                    they have never been in Korea and don't speak Korean and may be a second- or
                    third-generation Japanese citizen. They were still considered “gaijin”
                    (foreigners) and had to have an alien registration card. So how did this basic
                    animosity affect us?</p>
                <p>The first reaction of Japanese who are not internationally experienced when
                    seeing an Asian woman with an American man is to assume that they are an
                    American GI and a Japanese bar girl. That is a hard image to get over. Once they
                    discovered I am not a GI and she is not a bar girl, it was all right, but she is
                    still Korean. From a distance, my wife would appear Japanese to most people in
                    Japan. It is only when she comes closer that they will recognize that she is
                    Korean. Americans probably wouldn't notice the differences. There are
                    differences in cheek bone, in the color of the hair, and in the length of the
                    thigh bone, due to the respective national diets. In Korea, there is much more
                    calcium in the usual diet, as well as a larger quantity of vegetables and less
                    salt.</p>
                <p>When my wife went into a shop, if they weren't paying attention, the sales people
                    were very warm and treated her like just another Japanese customer, but if they
                    recognized her as a Korean, they became very cool. That caused some problems,
                    although I think my wife was usually comfortable there because, generally
                    speaking, the Japanese don't make a point of differences unless they are forced
                    to confront you directly. If you are in an environment with them, they are
                    oblivious to you, even as they are oblivious to other Japanese. Their houses are
                    enclosed by walls, and they keep a very intensely private area. Japanese
                    architecture and the shape of a Japanese garden focus internally. You don't buy
                    a Japanese house for the view, you buy it for the garden and focus
                    internally.</p>
                <p>They do this in their personal relations, which made her tense. Westerners, the
                    round-eye, long-nose type of person, are treated more like children: cute in
                    their own way and distant from intimate Japanese concerns. A Westerner who
                    speaks a little Japanese is adored. It is a wonderful feeling, you are coddled,
                    they fawn over you...to a point. The point comes when the foreigner's Japanese
                    gets good enough that it is no longer a barrier to communication. No longer
                    cute, a foreigner who speaks Japanese well must be made to fit into the social
                    fabric, even to allow discourse to proceed. Of course, that is virtually
                    impossible without a long residence and acquaintance with the Japanese person
                    encountered.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>A good friend of mine who has been a professor of Japanese language and
                    literature for a number of years and whom I served with in Hokkaido when I was
                    in the army, married a Japanese girl, whom I also knew. A very fine woman. They
                    went back to the United States, and he studied Japanese and became very
                    proficient. They returned to Japan where he studied in Kyoto as a researcher in
                    the Japanese language. He told me that he found the Japan he returned to very,
                    very different from the Japan he had left as a GI. The reason was that his
                    Japanese had improved to the point where it was no longer something that
                    separated him from Japanese society. The problem in Kyoto was that the Japanese
                    now were cold and distant. At the point that he no longer had a barrier in
                    communication with them, he had to be categorized within their system. He could
                    never become Japanese. Sort of like those Hawaiians who become sumo wrestlers.
                    They are wrestlers, but they are always gaijin. Some become Japanese citizens,
                    but they are always gaijin.</p>
                <p>The problem for my Japanese speaking friend was that he found his experience in
                    Japan not so much distasteful but much, much harder, because the Japanese he met
                    did not know where to classify him. The Japanese carry business cards which give
                    a lot more information than we probably would have on our business cards. But
                    this is because you must be placed in the system, so people will know how to
                    talk to you, how to relate to you, and what kind of a relationship they should
                    maintain with you. When you are a cute, stumbling gaijin, it is easy. If you are
                    a Japanese person, you don't let your daughter talk to those male foreigners,
                    but it is all right to socialize in a remote sort of way. You invite them out,
                    entertain them, give them gifts. Everything is fine. It is much as it would be
                    with foreign visitors here. But when you become closer, the relationship
                    changes. Maybe it is true for immigrants here who, after living in an American
                    town for a while, become one of the people but are still seen as different. It
                    then becomes harder for them, since they feel at home but not really
                    comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The ambassador during my whole tour in Japan was Mike Mansfield. He was
                    there for more than ten years. Mansfield was a phenomenon. He had more energy
                    than almost anyone else in the office. As I mentioned before, USIS was on the
                    second floor and had big windows that stretched across the entrance. I could
                    walk down the hall and see Mike coming and going. He had a spry step, getting
                    into and out of the car. I guess he must have been about 80 at the time. An
                    amazing man.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>When I installed the Wang VS-100 computer at the post, we were very proud of the
                    accomplishment and wanted the ambassador to come and officially begin its
                    operation. We arranged for a photographer, and I had a special terminal set up
                    in my office for him to use. He was going to go to it and touch a key and it
                    would say “Welcome Mr. Ambassador.” So we brought him to the second floor. I
                    still have a picture of him sitting at the terminal, holding up his hand and
                    saying, “What now?” That was because he had pressed the key and the screen went
                    blank. We had tested this repeatedly before, and it always had been fine. My
                    guess is, when he sat down at the terminal, he leaned on the table or something
                    like that, and the cable at the back had come loose. But Mike was a great guy
                    and never lost his cool. He always called me “Ted,” although I can't think
                    why.</p>
                <p>He also had great influence among the Japanese. First of all, they knew he was
                    very well connected in the Democratic Party and Washington. He was very credible
                    in interpreting the mood of Congress to the Japanese. But he would also do
                    things differently. In his office, for instance, he was famous. When he would
                    invite a guest in, he would say, “Would you like some coffee?” Of course, the
                    Japanese always had coffee and would say, “Sure.” He would say, “If you will
                    just wait a moment, please.” He would walk into a little small Pullman kitchen
                    on the side of his office there, and he would make the coffee and serve it. To a
                    Japanese bureaucrat or an official who is waited on by flocks of young office
                    girls, coffee or tea comes automatically; you don't ask. The fact that the
                    Ambassador got up and made and served the coffee became sort of a social bit of
                    cachet in Tokyothose who had coffee made for them by the American ambassador. He
                    used little things like that to great effect. He obviously knew what he was
                    doing. It was a nice touch.</p>
                <p>We had a particularly difficult incident in which Mansfield was especially
                    effective. It was on the occasion when a Japanese trawler went down. We had a
                    roaring time with the press; they were taking us apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the record a submarine surfaced...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: The submarine was coming up, and the conning tower hit the bottom of a
                    trawler and it sank. The submarine crew did not realize they had hit the small
                    trawler. Three Japanese crewmen lost their lives in that incident.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>We were getting roasted by the Japanese press on it. Ambassador Mansfield
                    singlehandedly turned the entire incident off. The way he did that was to get
                    his picture taken by the press with one of the surviving families. In the
                    picture, he was standing before the family bowing and apologizing for the
                    incident. The whole episode instantly vanished as an issue. It was no longer
                    relevant. He had the sensitivity to understand that one single act was what was
                    needed. By making the apology, the matter was concluded. Sort of like my
                    friend's ear in Afghanistan. It was over, and the Japanese got back to business
                    again. An interesting bit of sensitivity exhibited by the grizzled old coal
                    miner.</p>
                <p>Mansfield was an interesting ambassador to work for. I didn't work for him
                    directly, although I had opportunities to go sit in on the country team
                    meetings. In the morning, he would come into the meeting briskly, once everyone
                    was in place. Everyone soon learned not to be late for one of his meetings, for
                    they never lasted very long. He would brook no shuffling of feet or mumbling or
                    carrying on. He would come in and say, “What's up?” If everyone said everything
                    was okay, he would say, “It sounds good,” and get up and leave. When there was
                    discussion and you indicated you had something to say, hesitation would cost you
                    the chance and he would go on to the next person. As a result, Mansfield's
                    country team meetings rarely went longer than 15 - 20 minutes. His philosophy
                    was, if you have something to say, say it; if not, shut up and let us get on
                    with other business. He also had an enormous capacity for statistics and
                    numbers. At a briefing, he could spill out trade numbers and problems at a level
                    of detail that would knock the socks off the press people. An amazing person and
                    a very, very good ambassador, I think.</p>
                <p>When the administration changed, the mainly Republican business community in
                    Tokyo was fully of the opinion that they wanted Mansfield to stay. Which
                    important Republican politician wanted to come to Tokyo was immaterial, because
                    Mansfield was so good in maintaining contacts with the Japanese and keeping
                    everything on an even keel, that they didn't want to lose that capability. He
                    remained there for many years.</p>

                        normal assignment or one requested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: This was sort of an odd situation. I was getting ready to move on to
                    another assignment from Tokyo when I got a call asking if I would be willing to
                    go to Iceland as Public Affairs Officer. Being a PAO in my business is something
                    you very much want to become. It gives you the opportunity to design your own
                    program, to struggle with the many details of communicating with your audience,
                    and to get a seat in the discussions of policy. I had no previous wish or
                    thought of ever going to Iceland on assignment. I didn't know much about it. The
                    situation was that my predecessor there had evidently run into some rough waters
                    with the ambassador and was coming out rather quickly. They needed someone to go
                    in right away who they thought could put some oil on the troubled waters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might add that often diplomacy is more within an embassy
                        or a consulate or in the Department of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That is certainly true. The case in point was the ambassador at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It was Marshall Brement, who had previously had experience with USIA. He
                    had been a PAO in Indonesia many years before, so he knew USIA work and had some
                    very clearly defined ideas of what a Public Affairs Officer should do for him.
                    His concepts and expectations obviously were not being met by my
                    predecessor.</p>
                <p>The embassy in Iceland was in a unique position, although this is not unusual,
                    but for a European country perhaps it is. Much of the embassy's work was public
                    affairs. The reason was that our major connection with Iceland was political and
                    related to our image rather than the more tangible issues typical of most
                    embassies. Certainly among the major factors was not bilateral trade, because
                    Iceland was too small to be a significant trading partner. Its principal export,
                    salted fish, had no market in the US, and its resources were mainly in hydro and
                    thermal power, something that does not transport easily. One of its most famous
                    exports, natural wool sweaters, proved too warm for much of the climate in the
                    US. Tourism had leap-frogged over Iceland with the advent of long range jets
                    which allowed non-stop travel between the U.S. and European capitals. Iceland
                    had been a major stopover on the trans-Atlantic routes in the days of the
                    propeller airplanes which could not carry enough fuel to make the leap in one
                    hop.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>In fact, our automobile companies had sort of abandoned Iceland. Whereas they had
                    sold virtually every car on the road in Iceland up to a few years previously, at
                    the time I served there, the Japanese had taken over the automobile business.
                    The Icelandic market was just too small to bother with. GM, for instance,
                    covered Iceland from its sales office in Greece. Iceland didn't export much to
                    the U.S. except sweaters and some artifacts.</p>
                <p>Iceland is an unusual country. Icelanders claim to have the oldest, continuous
                    parliament in the world. The Danes invaded and took control in the 1400s and for
                    a while there, it was a breach in the Icelandic democracy. But in spirit, they
                    have a pretty good claim to being one of the record holders. There is still very
                    deep seated resentment, I think, toward the Danes because of their occupation.
                    Danish used to be their official language, but they scotched that very quickly.
                    In some curious way, the Icelandic experience parallels that of Korea where the
                    Japanese took over and changed things like language, the economy, and the
                    educational system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as an historical note, the Danes came in when and
                        why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I'm not certain of the exact date. They came in as part of their empire
                    building. Iceland is a northern European society. Their roots are old Norse.
                    Without much argument, it is the oldest language in continual use in Europe. A
                    modern Icelander can pick up the sagas, which are some of Europe's oldest
                    recorded history. The Icelandic “skalds” (loosely translated as poets) wrote
                    some of the earliest history preserved in Europe. They had nothing else to do up
                    there, I guess, except to learn to read and write. And they did that. Most
                    Icelanders consider themselves to be at least amateur poets, authors, artists,
                    or having some other skill concerned with the arts. They have a very strong
                    affinity for the arts. They have a parliament called the Althing which is very
                    old. It goes way, way back to when the chiefs of the different tribes on the
                    islands would get together and have what was essentially a parliament to make
                    provisions for the governance of the entire community. Icelanders feel very
                    strongly that theirs is an important contribution to the democratic tradition.
                    It is a fascinating place to be. The more I studied it, the more profound the
                    history became. Then again, perhaps something similar can be said about most
                    cultures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1982 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>YATES: Until 1985: three years. Iceland is technically in Europe but is
                    positioned about half way across the North Atlantica very critical place and why
                    public relations are so important there. During the Cold War, much of the Soviet
                    strength was in the Kola Peninsula which sticks up north of Europe. The only
                    outlets from the peninsula without crossing other national boundaries are either
                    by air or by sea, right past Iceland. That meant if we wanted to keep track of
                    Soviet surface, air, and sub-surface activity in the whole Atlantic region,
                    Iceland was the right place to do it. The U.S. military felt that it probably
                    was the single most important military outpost outside the continental US,
                    except, of course, for Hawaii. It was the base they valued the most outside the
                    United States, because it controlled the whole access to the North Atlantic. The
                    Soviets could come out via the Mediterranean, of course, but it was harder
                    because they had to go past all those countries and get through the Straits of
                    Bosporus and Gibraltar.</p>
                <p>A special problem for them was their very large nuclear fleet. Virtually all the
                    Atlantic Soviet nuclear submarine force was based on the Kola Peninsula. It was
                    from there that they could threaten the entire eastern seaboard of the US. When
                    their air flights would go to Cuba, for example, the bombers flying on missions
                    for armament supply or communications, they had to fly right by Iceland because
                    they couldn't overfly Norway or other parts of northern Europe. They had to fly
                    over international waters which meant past Iceland. When they came around the
                    top of the Kola Peninsula, the Norwegians would pick them up on their radar and
                    scramble interceptors to escort them, and then they would pass them off to the
                    U.S. Navy in Keflavik, a base outside of Reykjavik. Keflavik would watch until
                    they, in turn, passed them off to the Brits who would then carry on the
                    monitoring of the flights until they were well along into the Atlantic. U.S.
                    commands would pick them up again when they got closer to Cuba. By then, they
                    were well identified, and we knew exactly who they were and where they were
                    going.</p>
                <p>The submarine activity was the most important part, because they were missile
                    boats which would be stationed off the east coast of the United States and a
                    direct threat to our society. They had to pass by Iceland through a rather
                    narrow channel. They were watched by U.S. technical means.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of the security situation was that Iceland was also one of our
                    most important points of contact with the Soviets during the Cold War, because
                    of the large Russian fishing fleet that was out there. They were always getting
                    themselves into trouble. The North Atlantic is treacherous water and
                    difficulties for fishing fleets are not uncommon. If you are bent on finding
                    difficulty, that is probably where you will find it.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>The U.S. Navy had based an air and sea rescue unit with the “Jolly Green Giant”
                    helicopters at Keflavik. In 20-30 minutes, they could be over almost any spot in
                    the region. They were always rescuing Icelandic fishermen who fell overboard or
                    were injured on a boat. They would go out and pick them up and bring them back
                    to a hospital. We lived in a house in a valley just south of Reykjavik, and just
                    up the hill was the main hospital where the helicopters would take people. At
                    all hours of the day and night, you could hear the chop, chop, chop of the
                    incoming helicopters. Because it was a service that was used often, for
                    Icelandic fishermen the base at Keflavik was a very important benefit. Others in
                    the society found the Keflavik Search and Rescue Teams a great comfort as well,
                    since many of them were related to fishermen. They had sons, husbands, whatever,
                    out on the water and in constant danger out there because of freak storms. You
                    couldn't survive very long out there in the cold North Atlantic water. You had
                    to get out quickly. You can't do that by boat, you have to do it by air.</p>
                <p>We had incidents where Russian submarines ran into trouble under water and had to
                    surface. At those times, people may have been injured, or there was a fire on
                    the boat, or something happened to cause casualties. The U.S. Navy would go out,
                    pick them up, and bring them to the hospital. Usually, the Russian ambassador
                    would then come over and present his appreciation to our ambassador for the act
                    of assistance. It actually made for quite a happy relationship there between the
                    Russians and the Americans in Iceland.</p>
                <p>One of the more curious aspects of the security situation in Iceland was the
                    position of the Chinese Embassy accredited to Reykjavik. The Chinese Embassy in
                    Iceland was one of their largest, and the Chinese ambassador never failed to get
                    any American he could find in a corner and lecture him or her on the importance
                    of NATO. It was a strange phenomenon, to have one of the major communist powers
                    in the world lecturing the head of the democratic bloc that they had to maintain
                    strong defenses in the North Atlantic. But our presence in Keflavik and
                    effectiveness in keeping an eye on possible Soviet adventures in the North
                    Atlantic was important to the Chinese, because it bottled up a major portion of
                    the Soviet forces that might otherwise be positioned against the Chinese.</p>
                <p>So Iceland was a very important place in terms of security concerns. On the other
                    hand, Icelanders are very independent. They are an island people, and fishing is
                    a tough and often solitary occupation. In this country if you know New England
                    well, you will understand the breed of independent and tough-minded people. If
                    you are a foreigner in Iceland, you are not considered very desirable, you are
                    an interloper who is often left alone unless there is specific business to be
                    dealt with. Therefore, the presence of about 5,000 Americans just outside of the
                    capital was irksome to many. One said to me once that, in terms of proportions,
                    it was as if a quarter million Germans or others were to be quartered just
                    outside of Washington DC. How would we Americans feel in such a situation?</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>So they sometimes were uncomfortable with the American base at Keflavik. There
                    was a strong communist movement in the country. Physically, Iceland is quite
                    large. If you look at it on the map and locate the major population centers, it
                    is very much like Afghanistan in some ways. There is a mountainous range in the
                    middle and around the edge along the coast is where everybody lives, whereas in
                    Afghanistan they would be arrayed along their landlocked borders. Reykjavik had
                    a population of about 860,000 people when we were there; not a very big city,
                    but it contained more than half of the country's population.</p>
                <p>Of course, there were small towns and villages scattered along the coast line.
                    These generally isolated communities were a hot bed of communist activity,
                    particularly within the trade union movement. It is a little hard to measure
                    Icelandic political involvement; because the country is so small, it has more of
                    the characteristics of a village or small city than it does of a major
                    power.</p>
                <p>However, this small country is a member of NATO and the UN. Its voice is
                    important in world affairs. But the Foreign Ministry is very, very small. All of
                    the government staff could probably fit into a not-so-large auditorium. This
                    intimacy can lead to surprising situations. When we first arrived, for example,
                    we were in town for two or three days when one of my staff came to me and asked
                    if I would mind going over and having a session with the president. I said that
                    it was unusual for a Public Affairs Officer to be invited by the president of
                    the country to have a chat, one on one. “Oh, yes,” was the reply, “please bring
                    your wife.”</p>
                <p>Vigdis Finnbogadottir was president and probably still is. We replied, of course,
                    we would go whenever she wanted us to appear. We went to her modest office and
                    spent about 45 minutes in her office, chatting about where we had been, what we
                    had done, what our plans were in Reykjavik, and about ourselves. She is a very
                    engaging woman who was a French teacher, yet spoke very fluent English, like 99
                    percent of her countrymen, it seemed. Their intonation is strangely American,
                    which is odd, since they have such a strong influence from the continent.
                    Television, for example, is virtually all BBC.</p>
                <p>The president's office shares a house with the prime minister's. You walk into
                    the center corridor of the house, and on one side is the president's office and
                    on the other, the prime minister's. Literally, you could walk along the outside
                    of the building, tap on the window and wave to the president as she worked at
                    her desk. More than likely, she would wave back and return to her duties without
                    another thought. There was absolutely no security. By law, no guns are allowed
                    in Iceland except a few hunting rifles which were very carefully controlled. So
                    there was a very low physical threat, although we did have a bomb threat at my
                    center.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>That incident was rather strange and came at a time when we were preparing for
                    the visit of then-Vice President Bush. Although he was stopping only as a
                    courtesy and for a brief rest after an official visit to Moscow, the Icelanders
                    were excited and our small staff were working flat out in support of the
                    incoming mission. One afternoon just after the visit began, we were all working
                    in the third floor offices of the American Center building when someone
                    discovered a suspicious package on the stair landing. No one had been seen
                    coming in or leaving the building, and no one could account for the package. It
                    was innocuous enough, but had a message scribbled on the top of it saying
                    something like “for Israel.” Well, that was enough for me; we evacuated the
                    building and called embassy security to deal with our problem.</p>
                <p>That was not a welcome notice. Our American Center was across town from where the
                    Vice President was housed, and even the press center at the hotel was several
                    blocks away. The Vice President's security did not want to deal with the
                    situation, since there was evidently no direct threat to the Vice President and
                    his party. Of course, we could not resume work and had to find a way to remove
                    the offending package so that we could get back to work. I could not allow the
                    staff, or anyone for that matter, to re-enter the building. We went back to the
                    phones to insist someone take some action. Finally the Icelandic police were
                    called in and embassy security showed up.</p>
                <p>Although Iceland has no military, it does have a police force, and there is a
                    special unit in the police that is formed to deal with emergencies. With their
                    jaunty berets and special equipment, that force would, from time to time,
                    practice emergency storming of our building as a part of their emergency
                    training. They were always fun to watch during their drills, but most usually
                    did so with a sense of humor since no one really believed that they would ever
                    be called upon. Yet there we were standing outside of our Center building when
                    the Icelandic version of a Swat Team arrived. All agreed that it probably was a
                    fake, but no one could be sure. That meant that they could not just go in and
                    pick it up, and there were none of the special devices available to go and fetch
                    bombs that you see on TV. The fire department, which had also arrived to our
                    growing scene of excitement, suggested that they take a hose and use it like a
                    water cannon to blow it down the stairs. With visions in my head of the general
                    destruction of our library from a high pressure water stream destroying much of
                    what we had built in a plain but very attractive American library, we tried a
                    bit of negotiation to find a less violent way.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, we decided on a fishing technique. With a large fishhook and some
                    strong line, we snagged the package and with the line running down two floors of
                    stairs and out into the parking lot dragged the hooked package outside. Bouncing
                    down the stairs shredded it fairly well without the feared explosion, and it was
                    discovered to contain only animal feces. A bit of a smelly let down after all
                    the excitement, but still a relief and the limp conclusion allowed us to get
                    back to work in support of the visit.</p>

                <p>Iceland is a fascinating place with a complicated set of political and national
                    allegiances. If I remember correctly, three times in recent history, the
                    Althing, their parliament, passed a resolution dis-inviting the U.S. from
                    Keflavik. The American Naval Air Station there was noisy, and the local folk did
                    not appreciate it any more when jets took off at 3 in the morning. So there were
                    some base-community relations problems. The communists each year staged a march
                    over the approximately 30 kilometers from Keflavik to downtown Reykjavik. They
                    would drive or be bussed out to the base and then march back to Reykjavik with
                    banners flying as a show of solidarity that the base should go. That was an
                    annual, nettlesome problem for us. The communist movement, however, didn't have
                    much else to talk about. That was essentially their issue around which to rally
                    their supporters and demonstrate to others in Iceland their relevance to an
                    issue that most people harbored some degree of frustration.</p>
                <p>At the time, the country had very high inflation. It was so bad that they even
                    despatched a team to Israel to see what could be done. Israel had a very
                    successful program in controlling inflation, and it was thought that they might
                    be able to provide answers for the Icelandic problem. To those of us who lived
                    there, the problem was seemingly less complex than it was being made out.
                    Iceland had a socialized system where there was free medical care, free
                    education including university, and so on. The problem was that all those free
                    items were very expensive. I would have debates over this with my staff. For
                    example, I would come in at the start of business and one of my staff people
                    wouldn't be there. I would ask where she was. “She isn't coming in today, she
                    has gone to the hospital.” That worried me. “The hospital, that's terrible,” I
                    fretted, “what's wrong?” “She has a headache,” was the response. That puzzled
                    me. “Why go to the hospital for a headache?” “Why not just take some aspirin and
                    come to work?” With a wave of the hand my concerns were dismissed, “No, she will
                    get something from the hospital.”</p>
                <p>Sure enough, a couple of hours later she came in. She had been to the hospital,
                    and they gave her aspirin. I asked why she went to the hospital when all it took
                    was a couple of aspirin to solve the not very complicated problem. Her response
                    was, “because it is free.” “But,” I protested, “ it is not free, it costs
                    money.” She took time away from the office, she had taken her own and the
                    doctor's time, time consuming paperwork was done, and there always was the
                    “free” aspirin. My point was that somebody, somewhere has to pay for it.</p>
                <p>And pay they did. Taxes were outrageously high, as they are in most socialized
                    countries. It was very difficult to get them to understand that it wasn't free
                    and that they paid for it through their high taxes which they didn't like and
                    went to great lengths to get around. So there was a constant state of tension
                    between the people and the government on paying taxes, but the people liked the
                    idea of free schools, free college, and free medical treatment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in 1982, I assume you sat down with
                        the ambassador and he, having had problems with his former PAO there, must
                        have been sort of the equivalent of a contract about what you were going to
                        do. Could you talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: There was no contract. What I was supposed to do was in my marching orders
                    from my agency. I didn't work directly for the State Department, although every
                    official American in the country has to account for the wishes of the
                    ambassador. He is the man in charge, the personal representative of the
                    President. I had to use the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) and the USIA Manual of
                    Operations (MOA) as guides for what I did legally. There were some questions
                    there about what was being done. An example was the USIA international visitors
                    program, which the Ambassador considered his personal program. He would select
                    the people to go, make the announcement, wish them well, and welcome them back.
                    It was his direct connection. He saw it as a good tool through which to build
                    contacts in Icelandic society and, of course, that is the program's purpose.</p>
                <p>But in terms of the strict legal aspects of the program, it should have been
                    administered through a committee, not including the ambassador, that was to be
                    formed within the embassy to review the people suggested for the international
                    visitors program. That wasn't operating at all in Iceland. I told the ambassador
                    that it had to be done, but he did not want things done that way. He didn't
                    think it was efficient. He felt that the program would be most effective in the
                    manner he preferred. My first reaction was that, by regulation, he could not
                    manage things that way, but on the basis of the argument that it would be more
                    effective in Iceland if he were to continue in that somewhat different approach,
                    I agreed to give it a shot and see how things worked out.</p>
                <p>Sure enough, we ran into some trouble very quickly. The trouble came when the
                    ambassador felt the editor-in-chief for Helgaposterin, a communist tabloid,
                    would be a good candidate to go to the United States. I agreed that he would
                    make a good candidate. As the first step, the ambassador asked me to get the
                    editor to come to his office to extend a formal invitation. The catch was the
                    ambassador wished that meeting to be the first news of the invitation. I was
                    asked to bring the editor in without any particular pretext. Since the paper had
                    strong communist leanings, that meant that the editor would be particularly
                    queasy about simply walking into the American ambassador's office. I inquired
                    what the ambassador expected me to give as the reason to the editor and got the
                    response that he did not care, as long as I did not reveal the possibility of a
                    grant.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>So I called and asked if he would be willing to come to the embassy and pay a
                    call on the ambassador. He naturally asked, “why?” I finally convinced him to
                    make the call, and he grudgingly agreed to come. I met him at the front door of
                    the embassy and escorted him to the ambassador's office where he sat on the
                    sofa, still wearing a suspicious look. Ambassador Brement greeted him and said,
                    “Well, thank you very much. I want to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime,
                    to go and have a 30-day expenses paid visit to the United States. Isn't that
                    wonderful? When can you leave?” The editor responded immediately, “No.” The
                    ambassador was clearly taken aback; this probably had not happened to him
                    before. There was an embarrassed and pregnant silence. The next words out of the
                    ambassador's mouth were “Well, how is your family?” The conversation sort of
                    dragged down from there. After about ten minutes more of embarrassed foot
                    shuffling, I finally took the editor down stairs to put him in a cab. He was
                    fuming. He said, “How can you people do this to me? What do you think I am? Is
                    this a game?” Far from pleased with the prospect, he was explosively angry.</p>
                <p>I attempted to put as good a face on the situation as I could and said, “Look, I
                    will put you into a cab and get you back to your office; then in about a week I
                    will come talk to you.” That gave the editor a bit of time to reflect, and when
                    I next got in touch with him, he had cooled to the point of seeing the benefit
                    of such a month-long trip to the U.S.. When the trip was completed, the
                    ambassador's instincts were confirmed. It was a good and constructive grant. For
                    the editor of an important opinion-shaping weekly, it was an important trip.
                    Following his almost uniformly positive travels in the U.S., the editor came to
                    see the country as a more complex and attractive society than he had believed
                    before. He was, therefore, an important and successful international visitor who
                    finally realized what the program was. It was not an exercise in propaganda, but
                    a first-person, direct exposure to the U.S. and its people and culture. The
                    program was highly successful.</p>
                <p>However, the painful beginnings had a salutary effect on the ambassador. After
                    putting the editor in the cab, I had gone back up to the ambassador's office and
                    said, “Look, this is the kind of reaction you risk. If I had informed the editor
                    beforehand what was going to happen, none of this would have occurred. If he had
                    been violently against the possibility of travel to the U.S., then we would have
                    shut it off in the beginning, and you would never have had that embarrassing
                    encounter. With the chance to ease the thought to him carefully, explaining the
                    purposes and scope of the international visitor program, I probably could have
                    talked him into seeing the good in the offer. By the time he arrived at the
                    ambassador's office, he would have been able to graciously accept.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Ambassador Brement realized that was probably the case. So from there on out, we
                    convened a committee as required by the USIA Manual of Operations and selected
                    people from a group nominated by those in the embassy who found candidates that
                    would be suitable. The ambassador still made the official announcement to the
                    selected individual. He would welcome them and give the official laying on of
                    the hands. But we began the practice of telling people in advance that they had
                    been nominated as an international visitor and that the ambassador would like to
                    make the official announcement directly. In all subsequent nominations, they
                    proved delighted to come. The process was thereby made whole and in compliance
                    with the spirit and letter of the regulations. Yet that episode was an example
                    of a difficult situation where the Ambassador was not comfortable with the way
                    things were running, and there were some personality conflicts. The nominations
                    he provided were almost always good, for he had close contact with a broad
                    spectrum of Icelandic society. The international visitor committee at post,
                    thereafter, usually approved those the ambassador nominated, but we did have a
                    broader range of candidates to choose from and not infrequently found others who
                    were equally deserving. The process became more solid.</p>
                <p>There were other problems at the post. After my arrival, I found that the
                    Fulbright Commission was almost entirely dysfunctional. There were too many egos
                    involved in the management of the program, and the effort suffered as a result.
                    The Fulbright Commission is the one that chooses Fulbright grantees to go to the
                    U.S. for academic study. It is an important use of resources. In order to select
                    the best candidates, you must examine a large number of applications and then
                    have to make hard decisions on who is most qualified. The process is laborious
                    and often tedious. Examining and comparing research fields and work proposals
                    for what sometimes are arcane or radically different subjects makes for quick
                    frustration and not always soundly developed conclusions. The commission was not
                    working in selecting candidates and had to be restructured. The ambassador knew
                    it wasn't working but didn't feel that the post had previously failed to do the
                    appropriate things to make it go. It was a tough situation. It took me about a
                    year to rewrite the bylaws and get some rotation of those serving on the
                    commission. What had happened was a group of fairly senior and well-respected
                    people had been serving on the commission for a very long period of time. This
                    had led to a gradual ossification in thought and policy. Nothing much moved.
                    They regularly failed to come to any sort of consensus on program direction and
                    this led to a slowing of initiatives. Each was stubborn and unwilling to yield
                    on what they saw as matters of either principle or individual conviction. The
                    Commission was having financial problems and difficulties holding on to the
                    director and other staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I sat down with a young lawyer, a returned Fulbrighter, and, since I also served
                    as chairman of the commission as a consequence of my duties as PAO, I could
                    maneuver things to the point where we were able to rewrite the bylaws, get some
                    of the older members to agree to yield their seats on the commission, and get
                    some of the younger returning Fulbrighters as new members. After very gently
                    massaging the egos of the long-standing members of the board and a gradual push
                    to reform, things began to move. I hired a new director for the Fulbright
                    Commission and things began to perk up a bit. The newly constituted board moved
                    more quickly on nominations and agreement was obtained to keep business
                    moving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the library work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: We had a very good advantage in Icelandm, because our USIS physical
                    location was separate from the embassy. That was important for a variety of
                    reasons, not least because there were a number of people in the embassy who were
                    unhappy with their situation in Iceland. Ambassador Brement was a very hard
                    taskmaster, and some in the embassy did not appreciate his way of managing the
                    staff. I quickly learned you never objected to anything in a staff meeting. It
                    was possible to raise differing opinions at a later time, when he was willing to
                    listen and was convincible. Holding a reasonable discussion on a pending
                    decision at a staff meeting was impossible. Ambassador Brement evidently felt
                    that those meetings were primarily to disseminate his directives, rather than
                    for obtaining the views or thoughts of the staff.</p>
                <p>So if you felt strongly enough about things or had a different opinion, it was a
                    tactical error to table it during a meeting. It was better to wait until the
                    meeting was over, hold back a bit, and be the last one out the door. After all
                    others had left the room, one could mention an idea as an afterthought, or shut
                    the door and come back and say, “How about this?” Nine times out of ten, he was
                    happy to listen and almost as many times would agree to what might be out of
                    phase with what he had said in the meeting. I found him to be a nice person and
                    very thoughtful - as long as there was not a meeting in progress. There were
                    people who had really strong feelings against him at the embassy and that caused
                    a bad atmosphere. There were occasions when someone would speak up at a meeting
                    and be summarily cut to pieces by the ambassador. That was one of the primary
                    causes of the hard feelings. Personally, Ambassador Brement was a very shy
                    person who evidently saw group discussions as adversarial or at least was
                    uncomfortable enough to feel defensive about anyone who might raise a question
                    or consider an alternative.</p>

                <p>Since I was “across the lake,” as it were, on the other side of the lake in the
                    middle of town, I had the luxury, if I didn't get what I wanted, of putting my
                    tale between my legs and going home. It was a small embassy, so interpersonal
                    relationships of people working side by side all day long in very small quarters
                    made for frayed personal relationships, and that exacerbated the personal
                    relationships with the ambassador. Perhaps because of my distance and
                    unwillingness to challenge any point made in a meeting, I never had significant
                    difficulties with Ambassador Brement. Rather, I came to respect his solid
                    intellect and special, perhaps audacious, confidence in his own ability to set
                    an objective and follow it through despite the reluctance of his staff. At
                    times, I felt that he had little respect for the experience and capacities of
                    those who worked for him and relied too much on his own. Consequently, many felt
                    that any successes of the mission were assumed by the ambassador as his own, and
                    any failings were seen as lapses by his staff. That, of course, led to hard
                    feelings.</p>
                <p>Yet when something spectacular was done, the ambassador usually had a direct hand
                    in it. One example was “Crafts USA,” an exhibition of American folk craft
                    artists we staged in Iceland. As I noted, all Icelanders think of themselves as
                    being artists. There was a large art museum called Kjarvalsstadur in Iceland's
                    national museum and the largest available in the country. It is named after
                    Kjarval, Iceland's most famous sculptor, who did an enormous amount of work. We
                    got one half of the museum gratis for a major show. The concept came out of the
                    thoughts of Ambassador Brement and his wife, Pamela, who had connections at the
                    Corcoran and other museums in the U.S. that had specialized in American craft
                    art.</p>
                <p>USIA had no interest in it whatsoever. It sounded expensive, difficult, unwieldy,
                    and a one-country effort, which meant it wouldn't be worth the money because it
                    could not be spread across several country post budgets. As it ended up, we got
                    no money from USIA. All the money for the support of the show had to be raised
                    among the American community or businesses that had ties with the U.S.. The
                    embassy's economic officer at the time, Al Rimas, and I went around and visited
                    all the people and businesses we could think of, asking for either cash or
                    kind.</p>
                <p>For example, we arranged to get shipping of the artifacts from the largest
                    shipping company in Iceland. Getting insurance money was difficult, but we were
                    able to get it out of the largess of the Icelanders and the American community.
                    Iceland Air donated tickets, so we could get people to fly over. We brought over
                    14 American craft artists to demonstrate their work during the exhibition. It
                    ended up as a major exhibition of craft art, including furniture, textile,
                    glass, ceramics - the full panoply of American crafts. The people at Keflavik
                    from the U.S. Navy contributed an amateur Country &amp; Western band. California
                    wine growers contributed champagne. From all the cooperation and help we
                    received from Icelandic artists, the business community, and the unstinting
                    support from the museum and other professionals in town, we had a black tie
                    opening with square dancing and constant demonstrations by the visiting American
                    craft artists.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>The 300 works went on display. A thick catalogue was printed with an introduction
                    by Joan Mondale, wife of the vice president. It was a splashy event, the
                    invitation was the biggest social event in Reykjavik that year. Anybody who was
                    anybody would kill to get one of these invitations. It was black tie and free.
                    The whole town turned out. We got a double page spread in the largest newspaper
                    in town. It was a very major show and had a significant impact on the Icelandic
                    view of American art.</p>
                <p>At the end of the show, of course, we sold off all the art. To ship it back to
                    the U.S. would have been prohibitively expensive. After we covered the cost to
                    the artists and paid off the few expenses that we had, the rest went into a
                    scholarship fund to finance the travel, room, and board for one or two Icelandic
                    craft artists each year to travel to Deer Island, Maine for a summer workshop in
                    craft art. Contributions in local labor made a big difference in keeping the
                    costs down. For example, the display itself was all set up by a local artist and
                    some of his helpers, voluntarily. On his own initiative, he got a construction
                    company to loan glass blocks, the kind you use to build walls, and made circular
                    walls with them inside the exhibit space. That same crew of artists built and
                    painted risers to support the art closer to eye level. The national theater
                    loaned lights to provide illumination for the exhibition. It was quite a show, a
                    true international effort. Such a happening was not a matter of placing a lot of
                    shipped-in art in a large room. It took a lot of dedication and effort of dozens
                    of Americans and Icelanders. The result was a professional show that was, at the
                    time, the largest exhibition of American craft art ever mounted outside of the
                    US. It looked like a show and was something for all to take pride in. At the end
                    of the show, as I said, we sold the works and realized a total surplus after all
                    expenses of about $35,000. At the time in Icelandic banks, the rate of return
                    was about 10 percent. So we put the money in an account, and the interest was
                    used to pay for those summer sessions for Icelandic craft artists. It was not a
                    lot of money, but about $3,500 got them air fare on Iceland Air which gave them
                    a discount or free ticket to Deer Island, Maine. Their expenses at the school
                    would be paid. So from the show, there emerged an on-going exchange of craft
                    artists with the U.S..</p>
                <p>The bookkeeping process was not easy, because any time anything like profit
                    emerges from direct or indirect activity of the American government, the
                    situation can become tricky. You have to be very careful making sure there are
                    no impropriety, because there are funds involved. We had very strict controls,
                    and it worked out pretty well, so well that when we later had a team of
                    inspectors at Post, they looked at this real hard and couldn't find anything
                    wrong with it. We were very pleased with that.</p>
                <p>Right after I arrived in Iceland, we had gotten our feet wet with another effort
                    at an exhibition. We called it “Scandinavia Today.” Scandinavian countries had
                    identified the same problem with us as we had with them. They wanted their image
                    to be put across. They formed a consortium of Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Finland,
                    and Sweden and decided to go to the U.S. and make a presentation of their
                    cultures jointly. The problem was, they didn't know who to pick. There were
                    inter-Scandinavian rivalries among them, so they decided to pick the little guy,
                    Iceland, because it had no royalty and precedence would not be seen as favoring
                    one over the other. The leader of the delegation was the President of Iceland,
                    Vigdis Finnbogadottir.</p>
                <p>In Icelandic culture, the practice in naming children is that their “last” name
                    becomes the “first” name of the father followed by “dottir” or “son,” depending
                    on the gender of the child. Consequently, President Vigdis, as she was known,
                    was the daughter of Finnbogir. Therefore, since there is no consistent
                    patronymic, in Iceland, the names in the telephone book are by first names. For
                    example, in the Icelandic fashion I would be listed under Ken in the telephone
                    book. If I were an Icelander, my name would be Ken Ernestson, because my
                    father's given name was Ernest. The “last” name does not indicate family lineage
                    and changes from generation to generation. Because there is no other way, lists
                    of people are given by their first names.</p>
                <p>As head of the Scandinavian delegation, President Vigdis swept the U.S. and
                    received a very strong reception. She is a very personable lady and accordingly,
                    appeared as a real celebrity. Despite the planning of the other Scandinavian
                    countries to select Iceland so that all would receive relatively equal
                    treatment, she stole the show. The entire event became a romp for Iceland across
                    the U.S.. At least as the Icelanders told it, the other participating nations
                    were a bit miffed that Iceland was able to hold center stage at their
                    expense.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>At my USIS center, we scraped together as much of the press reaction as we could
                    from Washington and other sources, built a small exhibition with “foamcore” and
                    “Abstracta” framing, and planned individual shows around Iceland. The exhibit
                    had a reverse twist. We were showing Icelanders what Americans were seeing of
                    Iceland and other Scandinavian countries. In doing so, we made a statement about
                    American interest in Iceland and built interest in that nation of things
                    American. The “Abstracta” structure we used is a favorite USIS tool. It consists
                    of a collection of chrome plated rods like an erector set with plug-in
                    connectors. You can make big squares and mount foam core panels in a very
                    flexible arrangement. On the foam core, pictures or other items can be mounted
                    for exhibition. Since it all can be assembled and disassembled quickly, it
                    provides a relatively simple means of constructing a movable exhibit that can be
                    mounted in a variety of venues and then easily shipped among them.</p>
                <p>With the “Abstracta,” we had lights that clip on and other items that allowed the
                    set to be constructed almost anywhere and be presentable. We could move into a
                    bare room and mount an incredible exhibition with lights and everything else.
                    There were about 15 panels plus a collection of loose leaf notebooks with
                    plastic sleeves in which we put press notices. Icelanders like to look at things
                    in print, so they were well used.</p>
                <p>After we got this whole thing together, we had an opening in Reykjavik, showed it
                    there for a short period, and then took it around the country. This was a good
                    opportunity for me to meet a lot of people and make contacts in places we rarely
                    had the occasion to visit. We had fairly good success. However, the show
                    directly led to a very dangerous situation for my wife and me.</p>
                <p>One of the exhibition sites was in Akureyri, which is the so-called northern
                    capital of Iceland. The Arctic Circle almost touches Akureyri and sweeps by only
                    a short distance to the north. My wife and I decided we would drive up to
                    Akureyri for the opening of this show. We decided to do a bit of touring and
                    familiarization on the way, so we drove east along the southern coast to the
                    eastern town of Egilsstader. It was during the spring period in April and the
                    weather was getting warmer. It was a delightful time in Iceland. There is much
                    to see as you drive along the southern coast of Iceland. At one point, there is
                    a small lake and a minor glacier on its northern shore where large chunks of ice
                    break off to float in the middle as icebergs. In the same vicinity, there is a
                    stretch of black lava sand. We stayed overnight at Egilsstader and had a chance
                    to meet a few contacts at the school while in town.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>The next morning we were preparing to leave for the next leg on the trip,
                    Myvatyn, a notable tourist stop in northern Iceland, but a bit out of the way.
                    It was the prime reason to travel on the eastern route on the way to Akureyri.
                    That morning as we were leaving the hotel, I asked the desk clerk how the
                    weather was expected to be on the road to Akureyri. She asked what I was
                    driving. I said that I had a 4-wheel drive AMC Eagle. She dismissed my possible
                    concern, saying that we certainly would have no problem. So with a stop to top
                    off the gas tank, we were off.After about an hour of driving, it began to snow.
                    This was sort of unusual because it was April and spring was well under way.
                    Despite its name, Iceland is not a cold country. It ranges between 30 and 50
                    degrees all year long. But it is windy, and it can be unpredictable. The
                    uncertain weather is the result of arctic lows which come off the cold mass of
                    Greenland, another mis-named bit of geography just to the west of Iceland. The
                    Gulfstream waters come up the east coast of the U.S., cross the northern
                    Atlantic and split around Iceland, keeping Iceland not toasty, but warmer than
                    you would otherwise expect. Greenland does not benefit from the warmth of the
                    Gulfstream and therefore remains frigid. The prevailing west winds blowing
                    across Greenland are very cold and dry. But when those winds encounter the warm
                    Gulf waters on the sides of Iceland, a dangerous mix is created. Out of this
                    unstable situation come small but violent storms. These mini-cyclones, intense
                    little storms, often slam right into Reykjavik or somewhere else in Iceland.</p>
                <p>On that balmy spring morning, we encountered one of the fiercest. The storm began
                    with a light blowing snow. We had no way of knowing what to expect. At least,
                    this was true for us tourists, unfamiliar with the hazards of the northern
                    coast. As we drove along, another car, an ambulance of all things, passed us
                    traveling toward Egilsstader. That I knew was not common, for very little
                    traffic uses that road and there are few stops between Egilsstader and Myvatyn
                    Lake. There were a few houses along the road, but the scenery was mostly bleak
                    lava fields, the kind that brought U.S. astronauts to Iceland to train in
                    terrain that is among the places on earth most similar to the surface of the
                    moon.</p>
                <p>Although the light blowing snow continued, I was not particularly concerned since
                    I had seen traffic moving in the other direction. We kept on, although I slowed
                    a bit in the snow. As usual in Iceland, not much accumulates, because the wind
                    keeps anything falling moving along generally horizontally. The snow that does
                    reach the ground is soon lifted again in a swirling mass. If the snow gets heavy
                    enough, the swirling mix becomes very thick and results in a white-out where
                    nothing can be seen. Because much of this white-out is simply blowing snow, it
                    usually does not extend much more than a dozen feet or so directly up and often
                    disappears as quickly as it comes, swept away by the marauding wind.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>I wasn't going much more than 35-40 miles per hour, but the road was reasonably
                    clear and there was no evidence of a heavy storm. In this situation, I was still
                    confident that we would soon pass through this aberration. Coming up a slight
                    rise and rounding a corner to the left, I suddenly came upon an eddy of packed
                    snow across the road where the shape of the hill had resulted in a drift.
                    Suddenly I had all four wheels off the road, as I pancaked up on the hard-packed
                    snow. We slid to a stop. Now, I was in real trouble. We were in the middle of
                    nowhere. Nobody knew where we were. What had seemed to be a mild annoyance had
                    suddenly become a real threat. The storm showed no signs of abating, and things
                    clearly were becoming worse very quickly.</p>
                <p>My wife and I had no way out. We were ten or fifteen miles away from the closest
                    house and the wind chill factor of the storm made any thought of walking back
                    impossible. Since this was spring, we had no really warm clothing with us and
                    certainly no survival gear. So there we sat, hoping vainly for the storm to end.
                    It did not, and the snow kept deepening around the car, slowly burying us and
                    the engine that just kept running.</p>
                <p>We sat there for a very long time with nothing but our thoughts and fears. The
                    storm continued to build, and it became quite a bit darker as the white-out took
                    over our diminishing world. The temperature was obviously dropping quickly, but
                    the engine kept idling and provided the warmth of the heater. Luckily, when we
                    hit the pack, I was facing almost directly into the wind which meant that the
                    exhaust from the car was being sucked out through an open eddy formed at the
                    back of the car. With the exhaust went the carbon monoxide that certainly would
                    have killed us in almost any other circumstance. As a precaution, I left the
                    window on the driver's side open a crack, but the snow kept blowing in and we
                    were losing heat. Gradually the snow built up around the car. The blowing snow
                    got so intense that at times I had trouble making out the hood ornament in
                    front. It got up to the rails on the roof of the car. We were literally being
                    buried alive. As the snow built up, the engine was obviously straining to keep
                    running. As the minutes turned into hours, I could see that I was gradually
                    losing control of our lifeline to heat. Eventually, even though the engine was
                    running, I could no longer control it, because the linkages were gradually
                    freezing up. We had no blankets, no extra food; we were in deep trouble.</p>
                <p>After what we later found out was about four and a half hours of sinking deeper
                    and deeper into what appeared to be a cold tomb, I heard a snuffling sound at
                    the small space at the top of my window. The snow had reached almost to the
                    cracked-open window, but this was different. It was the very welcome black nose
                    of a dog. There was life outside in the darkness. We knew that if there was a
                    dog out there, there had to be someone with it. Sure enough, we soon heard the
                    sound of digging and not long after, the man with a shovel had made a dent in
                    the drift sufficient for us to open the door and climb out. We scrambled through
                    the blowing snow into the cab of his pickup truck, the dog bounded into the
                    rear, and he drove across the dark lava fields back to the small group of
                    farmhouses we had passed so many hours before.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>The farmer turned out to be an occasional hand working in the area. He did not
                    speak much English, nor did the kindly people of the farmhouse where he took us.
                    As we were chilled completely through, the wife of the house prepared tea, while
                    her daughter who had studied English at school helped us get a call through to
                    Reykjavik, letting people know of our predicament and reporting that we were
                    cold but miraculously safe. Our rescuer had found us through the efforts of the
                    desk clerk back at the hotel we had left earlier that day. The girl at the hotel
                    had heard the radio reporting that a vicious storm had struck along the north
                    coast and had affected the whole area. She had the presence of mind to recall
                    our departing questions about the condition of the road and became alarmed. She
                    called the farm houses along the road sequentially to see if anyone had seen a
                    car pass in the morning. There was so little traffic in that area, a passing car
                    was something to notice. With so few houses, there were not too many calls to
                    make, but when she reached someone who said that no car had passed that morning,
                    she was able to guess approximately where we were stuck. She then called the
                    first farm back to relay the information. The wife there told her she had no
                    car, because her husband had gone to the hospital in Egilsstader with a
                    perforated ulcer that same morning - that explained the misleading presence of
                    the ambulance - but she said that the hired man up the hill probably was there
                    and had an all-wheel drive truck. However he had no phone. Somehow they reached
                    him, and he thought he might know where we were, since there had been trouble on
                    that highway before at the same place. He took his dog and tried to reach us. As
                    it turned out, the storm was so severe that he was forced to detour over the
                    lava fields, off the road, in order to reach us. We had to take that same track
                    across the lava on the way from the buried car to the farmhouse.</p>
                <p>We unquestionably owe our lives to him, because we could not have lasted much
                    longer. The engine was pretty much done by the time he reached us. Later, when
                    the storm cleared and the man and I drove back to the AMC Eagle to attempt to
                    dig it out, I found in the four and a half hours we spent marooned in the car, I
                    had burned less then a quarter of a tank of gas. We were very, very lucky. I
                    never had the chance to meet the girl at the hotel again, but we sent her a gold
                    chain necklace as a token of our sincere appreciation. I hope she still has it.
                    The storm taught us never to take Icelandic weather lightly, no matter what the
                    apparent circumstances. The episode also demonstrated the care and thought that
                    all in that storm ravaged nation take to insure lives are not lost. We will be
                    everlastingly grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, did you work with people at the naval
                        station? It seems to me if you have 5,000 troops there, it is quite a
                        difficult mass to deal with in a small country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, it was, and that is what caused most of the friction. Community-base
                    relations was an important part of the bilateral political relationship. There
                    was a U.S. Navy Base Public Affairs Officer who was charged with trying to
                    strengthen ties, but my office held responsibility to monitor the situation for
                    the embassy. One of the major problems for the base was the annual march the
                    anti-base groups in Iceland would mount as a demonstration of their desire to
                    have the base removed. They would march from Keflavik back to Reykjavik, about
                    30 kilometers.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>At times, the political forces in Iceland would make a bold statement and vote to
                    dis-invite the Americans at Keflavik. In each instance, the internationalists
                    would jump into the fray and raise popular sentiment to keep the status quo. It
                    was the effect of public affairs relations that would come to our rescue and
                    protect an important defensive outpost and a multi-billion dollar U.S. taxpayer
                    investment. It was a petition drive, not done by us but by Icelanders who felt
                    strongly that we shouldn't go. We were not only important in the defense of
                    Iceland, which has no army or other defensive means, but we were also important
                    to the people who live in Iceland for rescue and other things.</p>
                <p>There is a famous story that illustrates this special relationship. One of the
                    volcanoes off the southern coast of Iceland erupted, I believe in the '60s. At
                    that time, the lava flow threatened a fishing village on an island in the
                    Westmanjar group off the southern coast of Iceland. At that time, the U.S. Navy
                    brought in tug boats and pumped salt water up on the lava, cooling it enough to
                    slow it down and form a natural dam north of the village. There was some
                    controversy whether this was the initiative of the U.S. Navy or whether an
                    Icelander actually thought of the idea, but it was effective.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the Westmanjar people, who were fishermen and exposed to the dangers of
                    the North Atlantic, felt very strongly that the American Navy was a very
                    positive thing to have around and any time the question of dis-invitation was
                    raised, they lobbied strongly for us to stay. Consequently, when the Althing
                    passed the resolution to ask the American Navy to leave, a petition drive would
                    start around the country, and a lot of people would sign, putting pressure on
                    the Althing to reverse itself.</p>
                <p>In this environment, public affairs played a critical part in maintaining the
                    base's presence. It wasn't a Marine base, like we have in Okinawa, it was a
                    technical base, Naval Air. You did not have ships pulling in, with crews coming
                    ashore on liberty. These were pretty settled people, with families resident at
                    Keflavik. They were pilots and technical people. The educational level of the
                    average U.S. military person at the base was much higher than would be expected
                    at other military installations. Keflavik also benefitted from its status as a
                    remote tour, an assignment that all careerists had to accept at one time or
                    another. Yet, although it was technically remote, families could be brought
                    along. At most other remote sites, you had to be apart from your family for a
                    long period. That meant, despite the weather, Keflavik was a relatively
                    attractive posting for career Navy people. This also meant that the relative
                    stability of the base was higher than other locations.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>It also meant that entertainment was more contained on the base than it was at
                    other places with a lot of unattached young males who had off-duty time on their
                    hands. For example, it meant that there was no street of bars immediately on the
                    periphery of the base. Many of the personnel went home from work, had dinner
                    with the family, and spent the evening at school functions or watching videos.
                    Iceland was a relatively liberal country, with less rigid mores about
                    co-habitation among those who were not married. While this attitude in other
                    locations would lead to an explosion of U.S. military setting up house with
                    local women, there was not much fraternization in Iceland. The Icelanders
                    preferred it that way. The base at Keflavik was very much an island apart from
                    the rest of the society. The capital of Reykjavik was only about 30 miles to the
                    north, but the quirky weather and the stand-offish nature of the Icelanders
                    conspired to keep most of the roving lovers on-base.</p>
                <p>Still, there was friction. Unavoidably, there were younger people that had the
                    normally active hormones of youth, and since the Icelander's view of sex was
                    relaxed and Icelandic women tall, blonde, and blue-eyed, the attractions were
                    still strong. Icelanders were famous for enjoying a drink or two, and alcoholism
                    was a national disease. Reputedly, the largest nightclub in Europe, the
                    Broadway, was located to the southeast of Reykjavik, and partying was
                    constant.</p>
                <p>The noise of military jets and the usual activity of a major military
                    installation was the source of other strains. There were fishing villages near
                    the base, and the sudden scrambling of fighter jets in the middle of the night
                    to intercept one or another Soviet appearance from the north got many from their
                    beds. These negatives made base-community relations a bit prickly at times. Of
                    course, there was the usual exercise of base tours and Fourth of July
                    celebrations to which the locals were invited, but the strains persisted.</p>
                <p>We had to devise programs that siphoned off as much of the resentment as
                    possible. One of those devices was the NATO tours that we ran from the USIS Post
                    in Reykjavik. Usually reserved for more senior members of the government who
                    were part of the decision making process in the capital, the tours were a staple
                    in our programming. The NATO tours consisted of an occasional program of sending
                    Icelanders to other NATO members in the region to receive briefings on the
                    reasons for NATO and how the base at Keflavik fit into the mix of defenses that
                    protected Europe as well as the US.</p>
                <p>We especially liked to send the Icelandic NATO tours to Norway. There, the
                    Norwegians, the linguistic cousins of Icelanders and their closest cultural
                    relatives in Europe, did not do any verbal sparring on the subject of defense
                    and gave the rationale for the U.S. naval base at Keflavik in the bluntest
                    terms. In the northern reaches of their country, the Norwegians had a border
                    with the Soviet Union and had nasty memories of the Second World War to
                    encourage them as strong proponents of NATO. There remained Norwegian animosity
                    toward the Soviet Union, and it was not leavened by the even closer geography
                    that Finland had, despite a similarly bad wartime experience. The Finns have a
                    longer, more southern land border with the Soviet Union and face them directly
                    across open water.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>So we could always send a NATO tour to the Norwegians, just drop them off, and
                    let the Norwegians take over and give the Icelanders the straight story with
                    much more credibility than we were able to muster. This was especially good,
                    since it showed them that the base was not “American imperialism at work,” as it
                    was characterized by some of the local opponents, but something that others all
                    over Europe had a common interest in.</p>
                <p>One of the key elements at Keflavik, and one of the major noise-making offenders
                    at the base were the P3s, the picket aircraft. They would go out and sit on
                    station for a long time, looking for naval or air activity in the defense sector
                    surrounding Iceland, such as Soviet bombers and the surface and subsurface
                    fleets. These aircraft had to fly all hours. Although they were not too noisy,
                    if they found something, they were the trip-wire alarms that would cause fighter
                    aircraft to scramble for an interception.</p>
                <p>This sudden blast in the middle of the night would wake everybody up in the
                    villages surrounding the base. Therefore, there was a lot of animosity toward
                    the base, not only because of the presence of the Americans and the beastly
                    noise that stirred their sleep, but also, the main airport for Iceland was
                    co-located on the base. If an Icelander wished to travel to Europe or the US, he
                    or she would have to pass through U.S. base security posts to get to their own
                    airport. For the fiercely independent Icelanders, this was particularly galling.
                    A new airport separate from base security was being built while I was serving
                    there, but this expensive work went slowly and every Icelander who used the
                    airport to travel in and out of the country was pointedly reminded of the
                    American presence.</p>
                <p>Naturally, the Americans also were uncomfortable with admitting the general
                    population onto one of the most sensitive intelligence-gathering bases in the
                    world. The situation was made even more stressful by the fact that members of
                    the Russian, Chinese, and other eastern bloc nations would also have to use the
                    airport/base to move in and out of their assigned country. There were numerous
                    occasions when traveling to the base I could see Russian, East German, and even
                    Cuban transport aircraft lined up on the tarmac only steps away from one of the
                    most sophisticated U.S. military intelligence outposts in the world. For all, it
                    was a most uncomfortable relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>It was therefore incumbent on the USIS operation in Iceland to take on the public
                    relations difficulties at the base and come up with innovative ways to take some
                    of the pressure off. Icelanders have a very traditional social structure. For
                    example, the elders of the village had a lot to say about what people think in
                    the town and how they consider outsiders. Their opinions were more important
                    than most. So using this social characteristic as a stepping off point, we
                    organized a special NATO tour for the elders around the base. This would involve
                    the most significant opinion makers in directly experiencing why their
                    discomfort was for an important cause. Although we could do little to relieve
                    the occasional roar of aircraft, we could bring them to understand why that was
                    necessary in the larger scheme of the defense of Iceland and her neighbors.</p>
                <p>Unlike the usual NATO tours, we flew them on P-3s, one of the aircraft that were
                    often flying over their heads. To get permission for civilians to fly in
                    military aircraft, we had to go to great lengths to convince the legal minds at
                    the Pentagon that it was necessary for the success of the program. We had to go
                    all the way up the line as far as Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger for
                    approval to carry civilians. We were in a period in which the civilian use of
                    military aircraft was being severely criticized, so we had to get approval from
                    the highest level. Yet it was considered important enough, because we were
                    having serious troubles around the base.</p>
                <p>Selecting a number of the most senior officials from the villages surrounding the
                    base, we put them on the P-3, took off, and let them experience what the P-3
                    does. They were taken on an unclassified mission, flying low over the water and
                    learning how those planes intercepted surface activity. The detection of
                    sub-surface activity was classified, and they had to settle for tracking Soviet
                    warships on the surface. Then they flew them to England and Scotland and let
                    them talk to people.</p>
                <p>It worked magic. It took much of the steam out of the complaints from the
                    communities surrounding the base. These respected elders could go back home and
                    tell their families and neighbors what was happening when those noisy machines
                    took off in the middle of the night. They could re-live for others their
                    first-person experience of what it was like and relate why it was so important
                    to keep track of the military activity that threatened them, as well as the rest
                    of Europe and North America. They were still wakened but now had a more visceral
                    and intellectual understanding of why. That program was very successful in
                    taking a special problem and taking much of the sting out of it, even though the
                    basic cause of the difficulty could not be removed.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>I had other duties to manage in regard to the base, but mostly they involved
                    staying in touch with the base information officers and monitoring their
                    programs to insure that they were fully consistent with overall policy and
                    offered no unintended damage to the delicate balance of the larger Icelandic
                    public opinion. The base information program was perhaps more intensely aimed at
                    troop morale than it was at off-base problems, and I had nothing to do with the
                    base newspaper or the other morale and recreation activities conducted there.
                    The only time I was brought into the picture was when their activities moved
                    outside the base and affected Icelanders.</p>
                <p>It was not only the problems of the base that bothered the Icelanders. U.S.
                    policy in other parts of the world often intruded into the Icelandic
                    consciousness, many times with negative results. Iceland was upset, at the time,
                    with American policy in Latin America. This was the time of conflict in
                    Nicaragua and Guatemala, and things were not going very well for us in Central
                    America. We were getting hit domestically on our policy in that region, and many
                    Icelanders were really upset, particularly Iceland's university students who
                    identified with small nations evidently being pushed around by a superpower.
                    There was a special nest of post-sixties radical students on the University of
                    Iceland campus, and they were hitting us hard on Latin America. We were getting
                    much bad press, and a barrage of critical articles appeared. Even the newspaper
                    that was most often supportive of U.S. policy was giving us a hard time. Of
                    course, the American press itself was highly critical, and the Icelandic press
                    was simply picking up much of their copy from their usual sources. The result
                    was an alarmed and antagonistic people, upset with our policy.</p>
                <p>At that time, we also invaded Grenada, and that simply added heat to an already
                    hot issue. One of my most difficult times in Iceland was to go on Icelandic
                    state television for a half-hour interview about Grenada and getting hardball
                    questions thrown at me. What was the purpose of our presence there? What does
                    all this mean? Is this an example of continuing American imperialism? Is this
                    “manifest destiny” in operation? Such questions were of the “have you stopped
                    beating your wife” kind. I am not sure I convinced a lot of Icelanders, but I
                    think the program helped to pour a bit of oil on the roiling waters.</p>
                <p>More effective was a program we brought in from the US. A woman, a former nun who
                    had married the Nicaraguan minister of labor after leaving her order, had very
                    strong feelings about what was going on in Nicaragua at the time. She came to
                    Iceland under our auspices, to bring a first person account of the Central
                    American problem to Icelanders. She was not a strong fan of American policy and
                    found much to prompt criticism. Yet she wasn't terribly bitter about it and knew
                    from her own direct experience what was going on there. She understood that the
                    fundamental problem was locally generated and did not have a great deal to do
                    with the Americans. We just got caught in this web.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Her husband had been incarcerated, and she had had a very bad time of it. The
                    first person account and her church training in presenting a story in the most
                    human terms made everyone who heard her come to a new, more complex,
                    understanding of the virtually unsolvable problem of Central America. We brought
                    together many of the people from the university, our strongest critics, younger
                    people, and some of the older radicals in town. Most of the people who came to
                    the meeting were communists or inspired leftists. They were a group who were not
                    among our usual crowd at the USIS Center programs and library. Many were highly
                    suspicious of our motives and came to scoff.</p>
                <p>Yet the topic had enormous drawing power. They had such deeply held feelings,
                    they had to be present for the discussion. The program had a stunning effect on
                    them. There were people in tears during the meeting. The empathy that the former
                    nun was able to develop with these people was just incredible. She reduced all
                    the coolly distant press coverage down to the most human terms. Her credibility
                    was high and her presentation effective. Almost overnight, the drumbeat of
                    criticism of our Central American policy stopped in Iceland. Icelanders still
                    did not agree with us on the principles and remained suspicious of our big-power
                    motives, but they began to become more sophisticated in their thinking and more
                    aware of the real situation.</p>
                <p>A student leader from the university, the one who was the spearhead of this whole
                    effort on campus, was at the program. After the program was over, he walked into
                    my office alone, sat quietly on the couch, and said, “I want to make sure you
                    understand. I am not a supporter of American policy in Latin America, but I
                    didn't realize how much I didn't know. I am going to have to go back and study
                    more.” That was a great victory. What it meant was that, for the first time
                    among the left in Iceland, reason and intelligence was being applied to the
                    problem. It essentially knocked the stuffing out of support for radical opinions
                    on the motives for US' Central American policy. It is rather unusual for a USIS
                    programmer to see the direct results of a specific program so starkly. It also
                    was one of the times that confirmed an emotional commitment to the work and
                    offset all the times that “evidence of effectiveness” hadn't seemed to surface.
                    So much is usually taken on faith when a particular grantee returns from a
                    month's international visitor program in the U.S. or a visiting lecturer comes
                    and goes, seemingly without a ripple, yet the cumulative effect builds unseen
                    and unsung. This experience, however, was different and most satisfying.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say there was a communist party in Iceland. Was this a
                        Soviet controlled party?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>YATES: The Soviets didn't control it, although I think they would have liked to.
                    I think they were smart enough not to try. My USIS Center was in a separate
                    building in Reykjavik. The only other thing that was in the building with us was
                    a post office downstairs. Once every month, the Russians would mail out their
                    propaganda. They outproduced us by a wide margin. It was clear that our budget
                    for direct mail materials came no where close to what they were spending. We
                    could always tell when the Russians were mailing, because downstairs the trash
                    cans would get filled to overflowing. The reason for this was that, since
                    Iceland was very small, a lot of the residents of the west end of Reykjavik had
                    post office boxes in the small unit downstairs. People would stop into get their
                    mail and find their box stuffed with the Russian product. Like junk mail
                    everywhere, it was immediately tossed aside, unread. Much of this offal ended up
                    in the trash bins in the Post Office, so they did not have to carry it home.</p>
                <p>The Icelanders must have done marvelously well with their recycle of paper. We
                    were delighted to see all this trash, since it represented a failure of the
                    competition and made our relative dearth of similar materials easier to bear.
                    Nonetheless, the Soviets persisted in their big effort. Part of their lack of
                    success probably came from the fact that Icelanders are very independent. They
                    are feisty people. “Don't tread on me” is something that could be used in
                    Iceland, as well as for our “in your face” forebears. The communism we saw in
                    Iceland was not the communism that we would see in China or the Soviet Union.
                    The Icelandic communists were “social” communists, a wish for a utopian
                    communalism rather than the Moscow tied communism we were combating in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>It was awfully hard to get people to understand this distinction. The awareness
                    of a difference was particularly a product of having to work with those who
                    would probably define themselves as “communists” but who would be hard pressed
                    to explain their beliefs in the manner Americans would find convincing. I served
                    in China, Iceland, Afghanistan, and Japan, and all had communist parties, but
                    they were all distinctly different. While there was a worldwide movement (there
                    was no question about that), and a worldwide threat from the Soviets and from
                    the Chinese to some extent, it never caught fire. Even then, it was clear that
                    their economic system was not working in any one of those societies that
                    professed to be the “wave of the future.” Other nations, as they became more
                    sophisticated, began to realize the thing called communism sounded good to some
                    of their people but did not work in practice. It caused severe economic
                    problems.</p>
                <p>I think the Icelanders recognized that. During the time I was there, they began
                    to get a handle on the tax problem. They began to make noises about charging
                    people tuition at colleges. They were openly worried about students who would
                    attend school but not study. Why should they? It was “free.” There was nothing
                    there of value for them to learn. So as the realization that the “free” aspects
                    of society the communists offered were not really “free,” as someone in the
                    society would have to pay the taxes to support those “free” activities, public
                    attitudes drifted away from communist dogma.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Still, the communists in Iceland were able to maintain a semblance of influence
                    through the strong ties they maintained with several labor organizations and
                    other public groups. In particular, the labor movement in Iceland was a strong
                    part of the communist movement. For a USIS program in Iceland to be effective,
                    it had to address the very labor groups that were the backbone of the remaining
                    communist effort.</p>
                <p>One of the successes of the USIS program in Iceland was the invitation to the
                    head of the carpenter/plumbers union to go on a special program that was run by
                    the AFL/CIO here in the US. The plan was to talk about what the American labor
                    movement is, what its themes, goals and practices were. This was a man who was
                    at the forefront of the anti-base movement, or at least his organization was one
                    of the major funding supporters. Needless to say, he was highly suspicious of
                    the United States. I remember when I invited him to come into the office and
                    talk about his visitor grant. He initially said that he did not want to go and
                    would not have gone except that the AFL/CIO was a labor movement and he was a
                    strong unionist. He just could not resist getting together with other labor
                    union types and was curious. Yet he was really suspicious. He returned to my
                    office to pick up his tickets and was very uncomfortable. Although he was a
                    highly intelligent person, he simply picked up the tickets and left without
                    saying much.</p>
                <p>About a month and a half later, he returned. He had on a necktie and white shirt,
                    had lost the Leninist cap, and appeared full of cheer. I asked how things went
                    on his trip. Now talkative, he responded, “Very interesting.” I pressed for more
                    details. He said, “Well, I didn't realize that the AFL/CIO is a real union.” He
                    had thought that the AFL-CIO was just a puppet organization. But he was really
                    surprised when he discovered that is was a genuine, and very feisty
                    organization. That recognition turned his concepts upside down and resulted in a
                    re-evaluation of his own priorities. One month of traveling around the U.S.
                    looking at different union activities expanded his horizons greatly. As I noted,
                    he was very intelligent and had clearly been misinformed.</p>
                <p>After this experience in the US, he gave a lot of thought to the direction and
                    emphasis of his own organization. Whether it was a direct result or not, is not
                    really clear, but not long after his visit, his union pulled out of the
                    consortia of unions that were the financial underpinning for the communist
                    movement in Iceland, including the anti-base march. His union was the most
                    affluent of the unions, so when it pulled out, they lost a major portion of
                    their financial backing. Subsequently, the communists lost their office that had
                    been located in the Carpenter/Plumbers Union building and were unable to muster
                    enough financial or popular support to sustain the large anti-base marches that
                    had for so long bedeviled bilateral relations. While it would be an
                    over-simplification to credit all of the change to a simple international
                    visitor experience in the US, it would be equally unrealistic to ignore the
                    obvious effect on the union and its leader.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Another aspect of the gradual loss of influence of communism in Iceland can be
                    found in the activities of our ambassador. Marshall Brement was one of the best
                    US experts on Russia. He spoke Russian and was very familiar with the communist
                    movement and its efforts, having served in Moscow. As U.S. ambassador to
                    Iceland, he began a program of social interaction with the communists that was
                    very controversial among those who considered themselves our traditional
                    friends. Conservative Icelanders felt that the ambassador had gone too far in
                    coddling the communists and their leftist sympathizers. That really rankled
                    them. They expected the U.S. ambassador to take his usual role of strong
                    anti-communism and not have anything to do with the group they despised.</p>
                <p>Those who considered themselves generally conservative would attend embassy
                    functions and would be elbow-to-elbow with communists. The political divisions
                    in Iceland at the time were so severe that if two opposites were walking down
                    the same side of the street, one or the other would cross the street rather than
                    pass by his or her opponent on the street. I had people come to my office and
                    say, “What is the ambassador doing? These are communists at his party. Doesn't
                    he know that?”</p>
                <p>We even had a case where one of the communists I knew came to a reception at the
                    embassy and during the conversation said, “Will you excuse me a moment please?”
                    Clutching the drink he was socially nursing, he walked down the stairs from the
                    ambassador's residence, went out the front door, crossed the street, and joined
                    the crowd where his band of fellow communists with anti-American signs were. He
                    kept the drink in his hand, while participating in the cheering against the US.
                    When the cheering was over, and the small crowd disbanded, he walked back up the
                    stairs and into the reception with his drink still in his hand and full of his
                    usual good cheer. Evidently he did not see any particular contradiction in his
                    conduct.</p>
                <p>What prompted his demonstration of a split personality was the efforts of the
                    ambassador to incorporate these antagonists into a reasonable dialog. That
                    relationship gradually expanded, with leftists and those who might be considered
                    “social” communists, slowly drawn into what would have been condemned by their
                    peers as a compromising situation not many years before. This effort, coupled
                    with more formal programs such as the NATO tours, the international visitor
                    program, and the constant visits of speakers in USIS programs, all added to the
                    gradual weakening of the intellectual commitment of many to leftist opposition
                    to U.S. policy. It contributed greatly to their gradual diminution as a serious
                    force, either against the base at Keflavik or against America as a nation.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The ambassador did a marvelous job of accelerating that process, but I do not
                    think he ever got full credit for that from State or from the conservatives in
                    Iceland who constantly grumbled over his unusual practices. Because of his
                    controversial personnel policies that affected all within the embassy community,
                    he later suffered a loss of confidence that never was repaired. While he almost
                    singlehandedly disemboweled the communist movement in Iceland, he was not to
                    enjoy the fruits of his victory with the accolades of the bureaucracy. Instead,
                    he came to be roundly criticized and eventually hounded out of the service.</p>
                <p>The conservative Icelanders harbored very strong opinions about dealing in a
                    civil manner with leftists or communists. In USIS, we sponsored periodic
                    delegations of Icelanders on the NATO tours I already discussed in relation to
                    the problems of the base. There was a particular correspondent on Icelandic
                    state television who the conservatives in Reykjavik thought was a closet
                    communist or at least a strong leftist. They didn't like him and resented his
                    growing prominence on Icelandic state television. One of these tours came up,
                    and I selected him to join it. He was smart, affable, young and probably had a
                    good future ahead of him in the Icelandic electronic media. So I picked him and
                    he readily accepted.</p>
                <p>I got a stiff call from some conservative Icelanders, saying I couldn't do this
                    and they would not cooperate with us if he were to go on the trip. They argued
                    that he would not be suitable for a NATO briefing and tour. In fact, the
                    Icelandic ambassador to NATO in Brussels said he would not have this man in his
                    room, never mind allow him to visit NATO headquarters as a guest.</p>
                <p>This was quite a dilemma. The NATO tours were specifically aimed at demonstrating
                    the value of NATO in protecting the security of Western Europe and the US. They
                    were very effective, as I knew. But could we afford to antagonize our Icelandic
                    allies in a confrontation over principles, even if we were convinced that we
                    were right? There was nothing to be done except follow through with the trip,
                    but the Icelandic ambassador at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels had refused to
                    consider the possibility. After wrangling a bit, we decided to go forward with
                    the trip, but skip the NATO Headquarters in Brussels. This time we would send
                    the group to Berlin and see first hand what the confrontation was all about.</p>
                <p>That change in plans neatly sidestepped the Icelandic ambassador's ability to
                    interfere with the trip, since it was fully U.S. funded and we needed no
                    blessing from Icelandic diplomats on what we could or could not do. We meant no
                    confrontation but felt simply that the value of the NATO tours was that people
                    like this television personality could experience a different point of view. We
                    had to proceed without allowing anyone else's political agenda from restricting
                    our judgement of what was best and in the U.S. interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>So the trip went generally as planned, save for the visit to NATO headquarters.
                    Some felt that was not much loss, since the briefing in Brussels was seen as
                    very dry and uninspired. Some advice we received was that skipping Brussels was
                    not much of a loss. The group went on to West Berlin instead. They visited the
                    Wall, which was still in existence. The Wall was always a sobering experience.
                    There was almost religious in actually confronting the police state across the
                    small no-man's-land that divided the two halves of what had been the German
                    capital. Something also happened to our special grantee upon witnessing the
                    reality of the Wall. The watchtowers, the concertina wire, the Wall itself
                    covered with the graffiti of hundreds of Germans who hated its reality and its
                    symbolism.</p>
                <p>He returned from the NATO travels a changed person. In no way could he be
                    considered converted from his vague socialist or leftist beliefs, but he now
                    more resembled a liberal American Democrat than a Russian communist. He had a
                    sort of epiphany at the Wall. He just could not conceive of what he saw. The
                    grimness of the Wall was beyond his wildest imagination. It communicated to him
                    the communist style of oppression that so many people around the world had known
                    and lived with for so many years. He had never viscerally felt that before.
                    Iceland is an island, a nation apart. For a short period, the Danes had occupied
                    Iceland, but there was never oppression of the Soviet brand. Icelanders prefer
                    to ignore their colonial status as an aberration of history, something to be
                    forgotten as a bad dream that has no relevance to life as it is lived. The visit
                    to the Wall brought up short any illusions of the benefit of the Soviet
                    system.</p>
                <p>To some degree, the visit pulled away some of the dust of illusion from around
                    his eyes. I can't say he turned into a new conservative, uncritical of U.S.
                    policy and accepting all that we offered, but he certainly became a very
                    important contact for me at Icelandic state television. In fact, he was my
                    interviewer at the time of my Grenada interview, which was from my point of view
                    a very positive thing, because it allowed me about half an hour of Icelandic
                    state television air-time to explain the U.S. point of view to everyone in
                    Iceland. No amount of other effort could duplicate that opportunity. I never
                    again had any contact with the Icelandic ambassador to Brussels, but we resumed
                    our NATO tours, including the normal stop at the Brussels headquarters. Perhaps
                    the briefings continued to be dull, but it was important to have people see the
                    headquarters and get a sense of the cooperation which was at the root of the
                    NATO organization. I wished that all could visit the Wall in Berlin, but it was
                    slightly off the main topic of the tours, and I had to satisfy myself that, at
                    least in one instance, it did make a difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in 1985, the Cold War was still going. How
                        did you see Icelandic-American relations at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>YATES: I think we had pretty strong relations at that time. Of course, it was not
                    too much longer thereafter that the summit was held in Reykjavik, mainly because
                    it was a secure place to go. There were few guns in the country, save for a
                    small number of strongly controlled hunting rifles, and there were very strict
                    controls on who came and went. There was virtually no possibility of a terrorist
                    attempt there. Yet we had the incident I previously described of the package
                    that was left in our offices on the occasion of the visit of Vice President
                    Bush.</p>
                <p>That same visit of the vice president also illustrated how relaxed the Secret
                    Service could become when in as safe an environment as Iceland. One of the usual
                    duties of a public affairs officer is handling local press on American issues as
                    well as the American press when it visits. We rarely got any attention from the
                    U.S. press except when a VIP (very important person) visit occurred or an
                    occasional correspondent dropped in to interview the ambassador.</p>
                <p>Since the vice president was there essentially on a rest stop following a tiring
                    Moscow funeral, there were no plans to make any press statements or expand the
                    purpose of the visit. Of course, he would pay a courtesy call on the prime
                    minister and stay in the guest house. There was no time for him to stand up and
                    take questions from the press.</p>
                <p>This presented a complex problem. The Iceland press was beside themselves with a
                    desire for some sort of contact with the vice president. In the presence of Vice
                    President Bush, they had the highest American ever to visit Iceland, and they
                    were not going to be able to get any pictures, not to mention interviews. There
                    was no time in the schedule at all for contact with the press. He was going to
                    go salmon fishing, see the president and prime minister, and pay a call at the
                    foreign ministry. The U.S. Secret Service, in particular, was adamant about
                    there be no access. I finally cornered one of them and said, “Look, I am
                    besieged by justifiable requests from the Icelandic press. It is important to
                    them and U.S. government that we have at least something the Icelandic
                    television can film for showing tonight because this is a big event for
                    them.”</p>
                <p>They were firm, “No, you can't do it.” I had to come up with some sort of reason
                    for at least limited contact, and suggested, “Look, what would happen if you
                    were ambushed?” “What do you mean, ambushed,” they challenged. I elaborated,
                    “Maybe on the sidewalk after the call at the president's office.” “He has to
                    walk from the president's office to the car, right?” “If we happen to have a
                    crew on the sidewalk at that time, would they be pushed away?” I worked other
                    arguments to bolster my logic. “Everybody agrees there is no security risk here;
                    what if you guys looked the other way?” Well, the whole party was tired, as it
                    had been a long and tense security situation in Moscow. And perhaps so tired
                    that they had enough of the persistent public affairs officer. Finally, they
                    relented, “Okay, but not for long.”</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>With that bit of opportunity and a word of caution, I set up my friends from
                    Icelandic state television on the sidewalk outside the president's office. As
                    soon as the prime minister and the vice president came out of the building, the
                    Secret Service looked the other way and the Icelandic press “ambushed” them on
                    the sidewalk. From that brief encounter, there resulted a show of about half an
                    hour that night featuring a joint sidewalk interview with Vice President Bush
                    and the prime minister. In terms of content, they obviously were very much in
                    agreement on most issues and the evident cordial harmony was a clear feature of
                    the show. While the Icelandic public got a very positive view of the state of
                    bilateral relations between the U.S. and Iceland, I got a few points in my
                    working relations with the press at Icelandic state television. The most
                    instructive part of the exercise was the fact that the Secret Service was
                    flexible enough to understand the need and look the other way. It was really a
                    nice event. That was one of the most constructive and enjoyable projects I had
                    the chance to work on while in Iceland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1985 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I came back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: In Washington, from 1985-89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Two things. The first year I spent in the Office of Management. I wrote a
                    study of USIA's efforts abroad to keep track of our audiences, understand who
                    they are, where they are, and how well we are in touch with them. For the other
                    three years, I went across the street to the Voice of America where I was a
                    Special Assistant to the Deputy Associate Director for Modernization. He was in
                    charge of all the relay site improvements around the world. It was a major
                    program. There was $2.8 billion dollars worth of work to be done around the
                    world to upgrade our Voice of America facilities. We were still using vacuum
                    tubes in our transmitters in many places around the world, including some of the
                    major sites in the U.S., and that meant that our facilities were antiquated. My
                    participation in the modernization program lasted from 1986-89. Then I went into
                    language training for Chinese, continuing on to Beijing at the end of 1989.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point. I think it is a good
                        point to stop. One question before we leave here. When you were back in the
                        United States, from 1985-89, was Charles Wick the director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he perceived at this point by USIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Charles Wick was director for some time. He was director when I was in
                    Japan. He was a controversial, mercurial type director. There were people in
                    USIA that didn't have much regard for him, and there were other people who had a
                    lot of respect for him. He had a vision of what he wanted to do. Many of the
                    directors that I had witnessed before, did not. That, in my estimation, was
                    something very valuable. You might not have agreed with what he did and you
                    might not have agreed with the way he did it, but at least he had a vision and
                    that meant something. Other directors simply managed the agency, keeping the
                    lights on and the money flowing. That was fine as far as it went, but Charles Z.
                    Wick added an extra ingredient of flair.</p>
                <p>Charlie Wick, or “Charlie” as he was referred to by most in the field, had direct
                    connections with the White House. He was a friend of the president. Mary Jane,
                    his wife, was a friend of Nancy. The original Wick/Reagan connection developed
                    in California, through a PTA, it was rumored, where Mary Jane and Nancy were
                    members. The Wicks even would go to the White House during holidays when there
                    were family gatherings.</p>
                <p>Consequently, it was a golden period for USIA, because it meant we had White
                    House support. The president would show up for White House type of things at
                    USIA. He even came to Voice of America and did VOA shows. He enjoyed Charlie, I
                    guess. Charlie was a musician and used to be the arranger for the Dorsey band.
                    His wealth came from a whole line of rest homes and health care facilities. The
                    great joke in USIA was that he was the man who underwrote “Snow White and
                    Godzilla” or something like that. It wasn't even a grade B movie. It wasn't very
                    well received. But he was part of the media milieu in California.</p>
                <p>Yet perhaps because of his showbiz background, he had an idea of what he wanted
                    for USIA and could be very persuasive, even dictatorial, about his passions. His
                    biggest idea was Worldnet, which he pursued with vigor and single-mindedness.
                    Worldnet was USIA's international network of television service that consisted
                    of studios in Washington and a TVRO (Television Receive Only) antenna at Posts
                    around the world. The accepted standard of the time was “C-Band,” which meant
                    that we had to use big, 13 meter dishes, capable of receiving C-band signals
                    from satellites circling the globe. Because of the usually very restrictive laws
                    of nations around the world (including our own) which prohibit foreign ownership
                    of broadcast facilities, we could receive only, not broadcast.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>The usual program took a lot of arranging and patience to make all the pieces
                    work together. All was controlled from “Master Control” back in Washington.
                    Close to the time of the program, we would establish a telephone connection with
                    Master Control over two lines. The first was the open line used by the
                    participants in the program in conference-call style. The second was a “coord”
                    line that allowed the programmers at the post and those operating the program
                    from the Washington end to communicate. The subject of the program would then be
                    placed in a studio in Washington, on camera with an earpiece through which he or
                    she would receive instructions from Master Control and be able to hear questions
                    from the field. Typically, because of the expense of the medium, several posts
                    would band together in a single program. All would be tied together
                    telephonically, but there would be only one television image broadcast to all
                    via satellite. The program participant in Washington could not see those on the
                    other end, but it did mean that we could “daisy-chain” audiences at a number of
                    posts together in a single program. It was an “international town meeting.”
                    Similar groups would be convened in a sequence of countries and, in turn, ask
                    questions of a resource person. In any one country, the participants could not
                    only hear the comments of the person in Washington, but also benefit from a
                    better understanding of the concerns of neighboring participating countries.</p>
                <p>At the receiving post, the audience would be arranged in a room with one or
                    several television receivers through which to watch the person or panel in
                    Washington. About 15 or so would be able to ask questions in the usual hour
                    program, assuming that three or four other posts would also be participating. We
                    could accommodate up to around 50 before the size of the crowd became too big to
                    be handled comfortably with TV monitors. We would often do a round robin
                    connection where there were one or two people in Washington talking to people in
                    Japan, Korea, Singapore, etc., all at the same time. They could all hear each
                    other, but they couldn't see each other. All they could see were the people in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>It was very intimate and effective. You could quibble with the statistics that
                    Charlie used in front of Congress, like citing billions of people contacted, but
                    nonetheless the effect was immediate and strong. It quickly became a very
                    important new programming tool that was soon a central medium for program
                    contact. I mentioned earlier in my discussion that we used videotape to some
                    effect. This was the same kind of effect as with videotape but amplified to a
                    different level, because it involved direct contact.</p>

                <p>YATES: The Voice of America had a modernization program to upgrade its aging
                    facilities. I was a special assistant which meant I was the right hand man for
                    the person who was heading up the program, Mort Smith. I had known Mort many
                    years before when he was the Deputy Public Affairs Officer in Seoul and I came
                    in as a JOT. Our connections went deeper, for my first post in Kwangju was once
                    his post. He was Area Director for East Asia when I was in Japan. He then had
                    taken over the modernization program of the Voice of America and asked me to
                    join him. The program was involved in making treaties with the various countries
                    abroad where we could build new relay stations and then stations which would
                    eventually be turned over to the broadcasting side of the house to operate. At
                    the time, we were working on a relay station in Israel. It was in the treaty
                    stage. There was one in Morocco which was under construction. One in Sri Lanka,
                    which was in the final stage of planning and construction. And one in Thailand
                    which was also gradually coming together. We were looking at some of the islands
                    in the Pacific as a possible location for future facilities. Tinian was among
                    the most important of them. While I was at the Voice, my job was to coordinate
                    these things, pull them together, and give assistance to Mort in any way I
                    could.</p>
                <p>For example, we had about 200 engineers at the Voice of America doing the
                    technical work necessary to support modernization, to design and build the relay
                    stations, and keep the plant running. Before you built a station, you had to
                    have some idea how it could propagate the signal. Shortwave radio doesn't
                    operate like medium wave, it skips between the ionosphere and the surface of the
                    earth. In some places, it comes in loud and clear, but in others, it may not be
                    heard at all. Under certain conditions, the signal can bounce between the
                    ionosphere strongly enough to allow it to be heard from a long distance. You
                    probably can't hear it within 50 miles, but you can hear it 500 miles away and
                    multiples of miles further, depending on the strength of the signal.</p>
                <p>The problem is, where does this thing skip to, because the ionosphere rises and
                    falls based on the time of day, the temperature, humidity in the lower levels,
                    and happenings totally out of control on earth such as when there are solar
                    flares. A lot of magnetic and technical changes can affect the height and the
                    transparency of the ionosphere. Radio waves are energy. You broadcast the waves
                    out and hope they bounce at the right spot to hit where you want people to hear
                    you. There is no point in transmitting from the Philippines, where we were also
                    trying to modernize, in the Chinese language and have it land in Korea or in
                    Russia, but not in China. So the idea is to pick the right frequency,
                    inclination of the antenna, and the distance from the broadcast point so that
                    the skip comes down where you want it to and your energy is focused on that area
                    where they speak the language of your broadcast.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>That is a pretty complicated set of dynamic variables. You need a big computer to
                    do enough calculations to maximize the possibility that you will broadcast as
                    efficient a signal as possible. The problem was that the Voice of America years
                    before had bought a large VAX computer built by Digital Equipment Corp. It was a
                    main frame computer with enough power to meet the need, but it was never
                    installed. Instead, it had been placed in storage. The reason was security. The
                    security gurus said we could not use it, because in order to meet the needs of
                    security, VOA would have to build a special room with lead lined walls to keep
                    emanations to an acceptable level. The system would be processing classified
                    information up to the level of secret, so that brought everything to a halt
                    three years before. Since there was no funding to do the expensive work of
                    building a special room complete with lead lined walls, a raised floor, ramps up
                    to the raised floor (in compliance with OSHA handicapped rules), special air
                    conditioning, heavier electrical wiring, and a multitude of other requirements
                    for a mainframe computer, the project was stymied. The Voice had spent about
                    $500,000 for a computer that it could not use.</p>
                <p>Mort Smith asked me to figure this out and get it installed somehow. Security was
                    adamant; it could not be done without the prohibitively expensive building
                    modifications. The key to the problem obviously was security. Searching about
                    for another opinion on the security question, I got in touch with a new
                    operation that had just been activated by the National Security Agency. Because
                    of the large number of civilian agencies with computer security problems, NSA
                    had put together a special staff to consider the problems from the point of view
                    of security. Their responsibility was government wide. The person in charge said
                    he would be willing to bring his people over and take a look and see what he
                    could do with it.</p>
                <p>We wanted to put the computer on the third floor of what is now the Cohen
                    Building. That location was close enough to the engineers and the propagation
                    people to be useful. Security's original concern was that if the computer was
                    too close to a public area, even the street outside, an uncontrolled person or
                    organization might be able to infiltrate our security by installing sensors
                    close enough to intercept emanations from a running computer. Some felt that
                    equipment was available that might even be parked in a van outside the building
                    to keep a watch on the classified material we were processing.</p>
                <p>Yet our third floor location was in the middle of an old, heavily constructed
                    building several floors above ground level. The concept that a large enough
                    installation of equipment sensitive enough to monitor our equipment could be
                    placed either in other offices of a controlled government area or on a street
                    two floors below and at least 75 feet from the internal room seemed a bit
                    far-fetched. The National Security Agency team came to the reasonable conclusion
                    that it was quite beyond possibility that the Russians, the Chinese, or some
                    other group interested in such arcane information would park a large semi just
                    outside our building to try to listen in on the hours long propagation programs
                    running on the new mainframe.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>So as we started to strip the problems away, they couldn't find anything as long
                    as we didn't go to a top secret level of information. No one could conceive of
                    such a possibility, so there was no particular reason why we needed a lead-lined
                    room. I asked for and received a letter from the NSA team for the USIA Office of
                    Security; it confirmed their finding that there was no problem. That was enough
                    to allow the project to get back on track. We simply gutted the room, put some
                    paint on the walls and cleaned up the general mess to ready the room for the new
                    installation.</p>
                <p>After three years in storage, however, the VAX was so old that DEC asked if we
                    would accept an equivalent replacement, one that the company was still making
                    replacement parts for and could ensure that its operation would be reliable in
                    terms of the warranty. The upshot was that the Voice of America got a brand new
                    main frame computer at no additional cost and was able to install it in a
                    simple, flat floored office environment. Finally, we were able to do our
                    projections and plots and even classified work on the needed computer. It took
                    us about three months to get it in. As far as I know, it is still running.</p>
                <p>Another of my responsibilities was to handle relations with Congress through
                    congressional staffers. Since the modernization program involved several
                    billions of dollars in very long-term construction projects, the annual budget
                    review in Congress always targeted the VOA program as something to chip away at.
                    The very young people who were tasked with taking a look at the program for
                    Congress did not have much experience on large scale projects such as the
                    modernization program, yet they had the power to screw things up in federal
                    programs. Even then in the mid-'80s, we had very strong restrictions on funding.
                    They would say, “What do you need this money for?” “You have not even spent the
                    money in last year's budget.” “Why should we give you more?” Similar questions
                    were leveled at us from OMB (Office of Management and Budget) whose staffers
                    were often young people with fresh degrees in economics but little field
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Of course, the reason was that such long term construction projects required the
                    commitment of large blocks of funding in advance, to be paid out as the work
                    proceeded. These were often ten-year contracts with substantial funding
                    committed in one year and not “obligated” until the year the work was completed.
                    You had to commit money to a contractor to start work. You could not “obligate”
                    (i.e., commit) it until you were satisfied with the sufficiency of the work, but
                    no contractor would begin work if there was any doubt that the money was
                    available. The Congressional and OMB folk said that we had 200 million dollars
                    we hadn't used yet, so we should only come back when that was fully used to
                    request more.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>It was very difficult for them to understand anything beyond the near term of
                    next year's funding. So we had to agree that we had earmarked funds for two or
                    three years of several hundred million dollars that was sitting there and hadn't
                    been spent yet, but that money was “committed.” Trying to convince these young
                    people of that logic was an interesting and sometimes very frustrating
                    experience. We really needed a steady flow of adequate funding to maintain
                    progress and keep ultimate costs as low as possible. For example, if we are
                    going to build in Sri Lanka, we need to have the money up front to be able to
                    build this station right now, although we are not going to spend the money for
                    three years. It was very hard for them to understand why we had to have
                    additional money.</p>
                <p>One of the more enjoyable duties I had during my tenure at the Voice was to
                    accompany Dick Carlson, the then Director of the Voice of America and the person
                    who was in charge of VOA News, to Europe to take a look at the facilities of
                    Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) and to see what they had and how
                    we might be able to more fully utilize them. I went along as the modernization
                    person and as a bag carrier as well. It was a lot of fun. The trip took our
                    small group to Munich, Bonn, Cologne, and other places, examining equipment and
                    office facilities as well as paying a call on Deutsche Welle, the German radio
                    corresponding to the Voice of America. So the job was not all hard work and
                    sweat at the Voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. We will pick this up next time in 1989 when you were
                        taking Chinese.</hi>

                <p>YATES: All right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 14, 1997. Ken, you have some thoughts about
                        working in Washington versus working in the field and also working with
                        Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I think the experience at the Voice of America put me in a unique
                    position, because I brought with me a fair amount of field experience. I came
                    back to Washington, first spending a year in the management side of things doing
                    a study of our audience records system. But the Voice of America gave me a
                    different kind of exposure. There, I was working with people who were
                    principally Washington budget people, contract people, engineers, and
                    congressional staffers. What I found in that experience was in some ways
                    disconcerting, because not all the people fully understood the purposes for
                    which they were working. They were working very hard, but many of the staffers
                    had never been overseas and did not completely appreciate the end results. They
                    did not have a sense of what was going on in the field, the “why” of what we
                    were doing.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Budget people, people handling congressional relations, and the people who were
                    interpreting USIA Washington to the funding organization, Congress of course,
                    really did not have a very firm grasp of the principle objectives in the field.
                    Some of these people had worked for USIA for a long time. Many others, however,
                    were political appointees who came in from being campaign workers or had
                    experience in business or some other part of government. Those who were the
                    “talent” in the broadcast studios often came from the societies to which they
                    were broadcasting, but even they had only part of the full picture.</p>
                <p>The consequence was that Congress, OMB, and other elements of the U.S. government
                    that were intimately involved in our budget process really didn't have a clear
                    picture of why the money was being spent. Worse, they felt they did have the
                    needed understanding, and could become quickly resentful if confronted by a
                    Foreign Service Officer who had just come in from the field. That resentment was
                    deeper since Foreign Service people serving in Washington simply were putting in
                    time at the “home office” while looking for another assignment abroad. If the
                    FSOs assigned to the Voice were in responsible positions with supervisory
                    duties, resentment was deeper since they were seen as interlopers who were
                    taking positions that should be available to domestic employees who sought
                    advancement.</p>
                <p>As a result of this resentment, FSOs generally avoided an assignment at the
                    Voice, since the hostility you had to survive overwhelmed the possibility of
                    deriving a real sense of satisfaction from taking a very responsible position.
                    Some thrived on the challenge, but more often than not, FSOs avoided assignments
                    at the Voice. I did not suffer as much as some, since I was working in a
                    position not in the usual ladder of promotion for domestic employees (although I
                    was replaced by one), and many of the people I worked with were engineers not
                    threatened by one so far removed from their own pecking order.</p>
                <p>At the Voice, with the exception of a smattering of overseas correspondents and
                    technical people at a number of the relay stations abroad, the policy people,
                    the broadcast talent, and the people doing the writing and program creation were
                    principally domestic employees. And many of them, particularly on the broadcast
                    side, were foreigners who came in under a variety of contracts, stayed, and
                    later became American citizens and broadcasters at the Voice of America. Again,
                    some of these were very fine people, very smart, competitive and had a true
                    mission as they saw it. The missions did not always coincide with the
                    definitions that were laid out by the posts in their individual country
                    plans.</p>
                <p>Often the disagreements between the field and the Voice became strained, but
                    since the Voice was administratively apart from the areas and other
                    administrative portions of USIA, they could figuratively thumb their noses at
                    USIA and do essentially what they wanted. USIA lacked the capacity to listen to
                    all of the broadcasts, much less to translate all those in foreign languages or
                    read the texts.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>The VOA charter realistically demands that the news section of the Voice operate
                    withoutinfluence from the policy concerns of the rest of the government. This is
                    as it should be. There were “VOA editorials” which were identified expressions
                    of U.S. policy that were cleared both through USIA and State, yet, as we all
                    knew in the field, there was much latitude for inserting troublesome copy that
                    gave posts fits of frustration.</p>
                <p>In the field, you had defined goals and worked hard to achieve them. At one time
                    oranother, the Voice would carry items or features that would confound our
                    program efforts and confuse our audiences. To citizens in another country, often
                    where controlled media were the rule, inconsistency in the point of view between
                    the USIS post and VOA did not signify a vibrant democracy but rather a confusion
                    of goals in a government that could notkeep all of its parts in sync.</p>
                <p>The consequences of this confusion have been worsened by USIA's merger with the
                    Department of State and the Voice being made totally independent under the
                    supervision of the Broadcasting Board Governors (BBG) in 1998. In my way of
                    thinking, any move to make the Voice more distinct from official channels is a
                    disservice both to those who work there and to the taxpayer who should expect an
                    efficient and purposeful American voice abroad.</p>
                <p>I suspect that the people who were involved in the changes and the people who
                    were makingbudgetary decisions were not very well versed on what we are doing
                    abroad. Not that it was secret, but it was difficult to find anyone who could
                    put subject and verb together on the topic of U.S. information abroad. We were
                    supposedly communicators, but we could not communicate at home. Part of that is
                    Congress, because like other federal agencies, USIA cannot not use taxpayer
                    funds to “lobby” Congress as we were enjoined against doing that. Again the law
                    has a good purpose; to ensure that a government in power could not propagandize
                    the citizenry using their own tax dollars. Yet this meant that the people who
                    were paying the bills could not really understand what their taxes were being
                    used for. It was a clearly understood rule that we were not to broadcast to
                    audiences in the US.</p>
                <p>Superficially, it sounds fairly simple. You put up an antenna, hook it to a
                    transmitter and a microphone, and you are on your way. But in fact, you are not.
                    Even with years of experience abroad and a fairly good knowledge of the
                    receiving end of VOA broadcasts and their impact, I was surprised at the
                    complexity of the operation. There were two hundred engineers on the staff, and
                    they all worked hard, because moving a reliable signal from broadcast booth in
                    the U.S. to a listener, often in a denied area abroad, was a very difficult
                    problem. Mistakes in propagation cost the American taxpayer a lot of money. You
                    have to burn fuel to put a signal in the air. If the signal doesn't land where
                    you want it to, the money you spent on fuel is entertaining turtles, a common
                    metaphor of the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>There were charges, for example, that in Central America where local topography
                    and the politics behind the choice of a location meant our relay station in
                    Costa Rica essentially broadcast into a lake. Other parts of the country could
                    hear the signal, but large amounts of energy was spent pumping a signal into the
                    water. They were the most well-informed turtles in the world. The only way we
                    could tell how well our signal was getting through was from responses back from
                    the field. Our monitoring of programs were not very good, because we lacked
                    sufficient funding to hire people to listen and submit accurate reports. Often
                    we had to rely on roving monitors who would move around the world, sampling the
                    signal in varied locations and conditions. At other times, we were able to
                    convince a bored housewife from the embassy community or a patriotic Fulbright
                    scholar to take on some of those duties. Volunteer work can save a lot of money,
                    but results can be uneven. Bureaucratically, however, economies had to be made
                    somewhere, and monitor payrolls most often came up short.</p>
                <p>An example of our reach was in Guangzhou in China. China was then and still is, I
                    am sure, one of the more important customers for the Voice of America. We have a
                    Cantonese service which absorbs a lot of time, money, and energy. The heart of
                    the Cantonese speaking region is Guangzhou, the old Canton. But there was a
                    great controversy over whether or not the people in Guangzhou could actually
                    hear the Cantonese Service. Some people said, “Yes, no problem.” Other people
                    said, “No.” There was not a large volume of mail from the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period did we have a consulate general in
                        Guangzhou?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, we did. The Branch Public Affairs Officer there was among the people
                    who were telling us they were not hearing the Voice of America. We would send an
                    engineer out from Hong Kong with a radio, and he would sit in a hotel room or
                    ride and bus and try to listen. The reports that he would bring back were not
                    terribly encouraging, they were confused. Travelers from the embassy and other
                    visitors with other business would volunteer to report on the reception of the
                    Voice while in town. Often, they would say that the English service and the
                    Mandarin Chinese service could be heard, but Cantonese was nowhere to be found.
                    Still, that reporting was admittedly not reliable. The problem was getting
                    Cantonese-speaking volunteer monitors to make the effort.</p>
                <p>Reception is not easy when you are abroad with an international radio. It is not
                    the same as turning on the old reliable FM or AM station in your home town.
                    Shortwave radio is subject to variations in clarity, signal strength, natural
                    and man-made obstacles, and interference from both intentional and random
                    sources. You have to tune it in carefully and keep adjusting the tuning as the
                    signal fades or interference blocks out a clear signal. At times, you can hold a
                    weak station for a while, only to lose it as atmospheric or local conditions
                    change. It is difficult to listen to.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>Sometimes you can find the desired signal, but it is not comfortable listening.
                    The loss of a signal may have involved antenna orientation, time of day, the
                    frequency that it was broadcast on, or the position of the sun. The only
                    broadcast facility that we had close enough to expect a reliable signal into the
                    Guangzhou region was in the Philippines, a long way from the Chinese coast. The
                    Philippines carried the burden of broadcasting to East Asia and China in
                    particular. We had a transmitter site in Thailand, but mainly medium wave.
                    Beyond that, there was nothing much else. There was Sri Lanka, but that was even
                    more remote. The skip on each hop is 500 miles and every time you get further
                    away, the wave loses energy. As distances increase, the reliability of the
                    signal diminishes proportionally. Some sites in the world are remarkable, and a
                    signal from there gets almost anywhere. Unfortunately, most VOA sites are the
                    result of political and economic compromises, and the engineers have to try to
                    do their best in very difficult conditions.</p>
                <p>Earlier I talked about the installation of a computer. That computer used a
                    program that was created by another agency in the government to approximate
                    propagation around the world based on the magnetic field, the conditions of the
                    ionosphere, the time of day, the position of the sun, etc. You dump all of these
                    variables into a computer, and it is supposed to tell you how strong a signal is
                    in a given area at a given time. There are more variables, the type of antenna,
                    the amount of power you are putting behind the antenna, etc. and these things
                    cost an awful lot of money.</p>
                <p>There is only one place in the world where it is thought that conditions are
                    almost ideal, and that is in Ecuador. There is a particular mountain in Ecuador
                    from which you could reach almost any point in the world with a shortwave radio.
                    That is why a lot of Christian broadcasters have located there. But for us at
                    the Voice of America, locating a relay station was a political question. What
                    government in its right mind, even our close and strong allies, would allow a
                    foreign government to come in and broadcast from its soil. Very few. And only in
                    those places where we had special situations, like the Philippines, could we get
                    permission. Even then, our flexibility is very closely circumscribed. We could
                    only broadcast in languages that were not native to the country. We had to
                    promise we were not broadcasting to the natives of that country. And of course,
                    we had to pay a lot of money up front for facilities on the ground and training
                    engineers and staff and hiring the local people. So it gets very
                    complicated.</p>
                <p>Another example of that problem is the experience of Radio Free Asia. Where do
                    you put it in Asia? You can't get there from California, although we had one of
                    our stations in Dixon, California broadcasting to Asia and to Latin America.
                    Latin America is a better shot, but they tried to get to Asia and it was not
                    very successful. They had the same problem. You put a lot of energy behind a
                    signal, and it bounces and loses some more to the turtles. Every time you bring
                    it back up again, varying conditions in the ionosphere mean a longer or shorter
                    hop, so the computer would plot the hops and try to tell you with a fair amount
                    of accuracy whether or not you are going to hit what you want. Another problem
                    was a signal that was excellent one day would be terrible when a sun spot storm
                    appeared. It is an engineering nightmare.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Try to explain that to someone in Congress. It is hard enough to do that here
                    when I have the time and a patient listener. Imagine what it was for a harried,
                    frenzied, busy, “I want it on one page” kind of staffer from the Hill. Therein
                    was the rub. My boss, Mort Smith, was working very hard at trying to negotiate
                    some of these deals like Morocco. The king of Morocco was a great help to the
                    Voice of America, and we were building a relay station there. It turned out we
                    were building it in a watershed area which tended to flood every year. So what
                    they were doing was building up a station on what were small islands above the
                    usual flood crest. For most of the year, they were in a dry sea, but this was
                    the only land that was politically expedient. I was told that the Morocco
                    station construction was the largest earthmoving project in the history of man.
                    This was long before the Chinese began the large Yangtze dam, which may replace
                    the Morocco station for “biggest” honors.</p>
                <p>At great expense, we put antennas, facilities, and power equipment on tall dunes,
                    which we were building to try to stabilize them. VOA was able to get permission
                    from the king for the site, but the construction costs amid a flood plain made
                    the cost of the station much larger than most. Those were the kind of real
                    problems that faced the Voice of America's engineers. If you found a country
                    agreeable to a relay station, it was not always the best place in the world from
                    which to broadcast. The best countries were not always accessible to us.</p>
                <p>We had great trouble in Israel, for example, putting in a relay station to
                    broadcast to the Arab world. This was a place where you would think it would be
                    fine, politically. The difficulties were military and environmental. The place
                    in Israel that we were negotiating to use was up near the border with Jordan.
                    The Jordanians also had a little problem with this construction. Not only was
                    there a fear that transmissions from the station would cause political
                    embarrassment to the government, the area in which the station was to be located
                    was on a fly-way for migrating birds, and Israeli and Arab environmentalists
                    just ripped the project plans apart. They said the birds would be injured by the
                    wires in the tall towers that would be necessary for the transmission equipment.
                    That alone put the project on hold for a long, long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Israel was also afraid that Israel fighter jets and military helicopters might be
                    affected by the high energy levels put out by the transmission facilities. There
                    was a suspicion that the emissions would interfere with the “fly-by-wire”
                    control systems of several models in the Israeli inventory. Engineering tests
                    over similarly powerful short wave transmitters in the U.S. confirmed the
                    manufacturers' assertions that there would be no problem, but the Israelis were
                    suspicious nonetheless. The area available for Israel to maneuver modern,
                    high-speed aircraft is very limited and every square mile of the country is a
                    part of their exercise area. The upshot was that the project was indefinitely
                    stalled, while things such as the environment and military questions were sorted
                    out. Politically, it got impossible to overcome such difficulties, particularly,
                    I suspect, since it was also strong Israeli sentiment that the station would
                    eventually be an embarrassment, so even as strong and dependent an ally as
                    Israel could not stomach the positioning of a VOA relay station on its
                    territory. The bottom line was the Israeli station could not be built and never
                    will be. So we lost that one. Part of the need for that station was to improve
                    the quality of the signal broadcast into the southern part of the then Soviet
                    Union. But it took so long to put together that the politics of the moment and
                    the dissolution of the Soviet Union took precedence, a very expensive, very
                    long-term, very difficult agreement that Mort Smith had negotiated eventually
                    had to be reversed.</p>
                <p>A new relay site in troubled Sri Lanka was under way, and in Thailand we were
                    converting what was a medium wave facility into a larger facility with a
                    powerful shortwave capability. Still, we were searching for other locations.
                    Korea was looked at, but politically it wasn't good. The Korean government felt
                    they would find it difficult. They were just beginning to open ties with China,
                    and they felt any major location of American propaganda radio on the shores of
                    Korea would interfere with the smooth building of relations in the area
                    themselves. Therefore, another stalwart ally got cold feet about cooperation
                    with the U.S. on international radio. Besides, such a large scale project of
                    construction would have set up a frenzy of land speculation in Korea, which the
                    Korean government felt would be inimical to its plans for the reconstruction of
                    the country's economy. So that one also went down the tubes.</p>
                <p>We had been negotiating with the Philippines at the time, reworking the agreement
                    with them. Those were the years of turmoil, the end of the Marcos era and
                    beginning of the Aquino age in the Philippines. The Filipinos were beginning to
                    be much more independent of the U.S. Even the ones who were strong friends of
                    the U.S. would counsel against any major change in what was going on there,
                    because they would be looked at as “American Boys.” We couldn't go to Taiwan,
                    because that would interrupt our own connection with China. That would be too
                    blatant an insult to the Beijing we were struggling to keep in a moderate frame
                    of mind, despite the recurrent MFN deliberations in Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Guam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>YATES: Tinian was the place of choice. Guam is a small place. It takes a lot of
                    space to put in a relay station. You have to have large antenna fields. Guam is
                    fairly well populated and you would have to buy people out. You need flat land
                    that is relatively unobstructed. The take-off angle of the signal is upward, but
                    for long distances, it should be as low an elevation as possible so as to
                    minimize the number of physical “skips” that it takes to reach the target. Each
                    skip reduces the amount of energy in the signal, so you lose clarity for the
                    listener. You also need land that has the proper electronic characteristics in
                    terms of sunlight and the location of large bodies of water. There is an
                    incredible formula used to figure out where you can put these stations.</p>
                <p>The only suitable place they could find was Tinian, an island with a mesa-like
                    topography. There are relatively few jobs for the people who live on Tinian, and
                    a relay station would be a fine opportunity for them. The other part of the
                    opportunity is that a relay station needs lots power to boost a shortwave signal
                    over long distances. This meant the installation of a very large power facility;
                    without too much added expense, it could be over-built so that the local
                    government would be able to draw off power from this facility and use it to
                    build local industry without an enormous investment themselves. That kind of
                    unique marriage of necessity and technical capacity was very rare. As far as I
                    know, the Tinian station is progressing, but it has not yet been built.</p>
                <p>It takes about ten years to put a station together. Very few remote areas have
                    the railroads, docks, and other facilities needed to bring in fuel that make
                    these things run. So it means far greater infrastructure building than would be
                    normal in these areas. It is very complicated and takes a lot of money. When we
                    go to the Hill with such projects, the relatively young people who serve on the
                    committee staff must gain a fair bit of knowledge before being able to make
                    reasonable recommendations about the modernization program. Yet getting them to
                    understand the complexity of the program and why we needed ten years of money up
                    front was an exercise in frustration. But we tried repeatedly. We were pushing
                    that stone up the “hill” all the time. Invariably, it would roll back down, and
                    we would try again.</p>
                <p>It was very hard to get people to understand the purpose of all this and why we
                    needed so much money. Why would the American taxpayer put money into building an
                    expensive power facility on Tinian Island when Detroit was burning? It is a
                    pretty hard argument to defend against. You can take the longer view and say if
                    we do not maintain relationships with the rest of the world, we will lose jobs.
                    Much of our industry is dependent on exports. Who buys the products we make? We
                    certainly do not eat all the wheat we grow. The same can be said for other
                    agricultural and industrial products. Much of our production is bought by
                    peoples who listen to the Voice of Americapeople who learn about this country
                    from the Voice of America and get to trust its products and people.�If we don't
                    do a good job of communicating, we don't have good jobs back here. It gets that
                    basic sometimes. For some reason, it seemed difficult for USIA to communicate
                    such a fundamental idea to Congress, not to mention the legal prohibitions from
                    communicating directly with the American public.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a hard one. Did you run into the argument that the
                        BBC is taking care of it anyway?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: You can't hear the BBC in every place around the world either. China was
                    one exception, because they had a very fine facility in Hong Kong. Don't ask me
                    what is going to happen after reversion. The BBC previously used an island off
                    Hong Kong where they had chosen to place their transmitter. From that point on,
                    they were “5 by 5,” as radio technical people say, with a very, very strong
                    shortwave signal into China and, I guess, medium wave in Cantonese into nearby
                    Guangzhou and its surrounding Cantonese-speaking area. In any event, the BBC
                    does not explain the United States of America.It's not in their charter.</p>
                <p>While you may get the news, which may be close to the way we might report it, the
                    British radio does not explain us, and that is what is intended to be the
                    principal responsibility of the Voice abroad. We were not out there,
                    single-mindedly fighting communism, although that was certainly the rationale
                    which was paraded on the Hill every time we went there for our budget. When the
                    Soviet Union dissolved into its constituent republics, there was an open
                    question about how much of the change was based on information or ideas derived
                    from the Voice of America. I cannot shed any empirical light on the question,
                    but it is just common sense that almost half a century of broadcasting likely
                    had a special effect.</p>
                <p>The basic economic system of the Soviet Union was no good, so it probably would
                    have fallen eventually, no matter what the Voice of America said, but VOA
                    probably had something to do with speeding up the process. A little bit of an
                    investment in information goes a long way in removing a need for the much larger
                    necessary investment in defense if the communist system had continued to spread.
                    So we were hoist on our own petard. We became known as the commie fighters,
                    fending off the red menace, but we had a much larger role in representing the
                    U.S. to millions upon millions who probably never will visit the U.S.
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>USIA's essential role, its chief purpose for being, was the promotion of the US;
                    building understanding for its policy, culture, and society; and stimulating an
                    environment for trade. One of the larger part of these responsibilities is our
                    educational exchange programs, such as the Fulbright scholarships and
                    educational counseling. The education programs have been the basis for much of
                    the understanding that we have developed with other countries over the years.
                    Similarly effective is our international visitor program where we provide visits
                    to the U.S. for people that our posts identify as potential leaders over he next
                    decade or so. The multiplicity of program tools that USIA has been able to bring
                    to bear on misunderstanding and ignorance is misunderstood.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>The Voice of America, however, is a very different tool from the standard USIS
                    programs that are used abroad. It is a passive tool in comparison with the
                    intensely individual efforts that overseas posts make. You throw things into the
                    wind and hope somebody will tune in. Someone has to turn you on and someone has
                    to listen, sometimes at great danger to himself. In China or the Soviet Union,
                    it was dangerous to do that. But people did and I think VOA provided a special
                    service that was different from the other services provided by the USIS
                    operation at the embassy. The USIS operations in any one country had a more
                    personal approach. That meant leaving the desk and getting out into the
                    university and sitting down in professors' offices, and talking to deans and
                    students or visiting media where placement was always an objective. The question
                    is, how many students can you talk to? These universities have tens of thousands
                    of students. We try to talk to the students who are the best and probably the
                    future leaders of the country, those who will be able to pass along the
                    information we impart to them. So we put a lot of effort into defining our
                    audience.</p>
                <p>We have talked about that to some extent before when I discussed Japan. It is
                    something that was an important part of our work. By focusing efforts on a
                    smaller number of communicators, however, our numbers began to decline. The more
                    efficient we got in identifying our audience, the smaller the number of select
                    people we were addressing in a given country. Whereas the Voice of America could
                    claim millions of people listening, we could claim only hundreds on a personal
                    contact level. That doesn't necessarily mean one is better than the other. In
                    fact, personal contact would likely have to be considered much more important.
                    The one-on-one relationships that developed because of exchanges had much
                    greater impact, I believe, partially because of a greater credibility and the
                    selectivity involving one or several individuals that will probably have
                    significant responsibility in the future affairs of their country. VOA serves a
                    different purpose and, therefore, must be judged by a different yardstick.</p>
                <p>One of the attributes of the Voice of America that is politically important in
                    Washington is its utility as an emergency network for Americans abroad. Almost
                    every traveler listens to the Voice of America, but originally it was not
                    intended for Americans, but for a foreign audience. Yet until CNN became almost
                    omnipresent in hotels around the globe, when you traveled abroad, about the only
                    way to get American news was the Voice of America. Newspapers were late, if you
                    could get them. Local media often had little or no interest in American
                    affairsneither did BBC for that matterbut you could rely on the Voice of
                    America. News people and American travelers abroad were well served by the Voice
                    of America. Each time there was an attempt to reduce programming, those folks
                    would rise up in support that became an important part of VOA's justification.
                    But that was not the justification for USIA efforts abroad in the embassies. So
                    we had parallel tracks but very different constituencies and very different
                    purposes and particularly different tools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you up against pressure groups, Cuban-Americans,
                        Irish-Americans, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>YATES: Absolutely. There was no question that was one of the most nettlesome, yet
                    most advantageous support the Voice had. Every time we would come up with a
                    budget cut, small services like Lithuanian would come under fire. You can't
                    imagine the strength of the Lithuanian community in this country until you try
                    to cut the Lithuanian service. They felt it was an important link to their
                    homeland. It was a strong post to lean on in times that the Russians were trying
                    to subsume the Lithuanian culture into the greater Russia. How many Lithuanians
                    live in Cleveland, for example? You would be surprised to find out. They would
                    all get together and write letters to their local congressman. There was a
                    devilish cry of pain on the Hill every time we tried to cut any of those small
                    services. It meant that all of the constituents would come out of the walls onto
                    the congressional backs, and we would get rockets from the Hill saying we could
                    not even think of such a move. They would earmark funds in the appropriation
                    bill to make sure that didn't happen. So this sort of earmarking was an
                    incredible bat with which to beat the Voice of America. You can argue that is a
                    good thing, but at the time, something else had to give. You had to reduce
                    Chinese or get rid of somebody else or some other service that we were
                    doing.</p>
                <p>One of the most important services of the Voice of America over the years, was
                    the special English program. This was a program in which only about 1200 English
                    words were used. This was like what the Reader's Digest does to ensure that its
                    magazine is readable for all. All text is limited to those 1,200 words except
                    when certain terms must be used to be clear. In such cases, the new term is
                    fully defined in the vocabulary of the approved 1,200. This practice gives
                    somebody who doesn't speak native English a much better grasp of what is being
                    discussed. It allows them to practice their English without struggling to deal
                    with the expanded vocabulary most often used by educated speakers of English.
                    Special English is spoken very slowly, so that every word is pronounced clearly
                    and distinctly, giving a non-native speaker of English a better chance to
                    comprehend. Sometimes, it can become boring for an American native-English
                    speaker to listen to, but it is very effective for English-as-a-second-language
                    people and if there is heavy interference, a weak signal, or fading, the
                    broadcasts in special English can be a relief even for native speakers who have
                    a better chance of following the thought.</p>
                <p>One good example of the utility of special English can be found in China. After I
                    got there, it was clear that the Voice of America was being listened to with the
                    blessing of the authorities. It was a practice that was followed even in the
                    middle of the Cultural Revolution. On the face of it, that does not sound
                    reasonable. But on examination, this remarkable permission made complete sense.
                    The Chinese understood that their students would have to learn English to be
                    competitive in world markets, and so they had to have the facilities such as
                    language laboratories and native speakers to make their training effective. But
                    China didn't have the money to spread a lot of English teaching resources all
                    over the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>However, the Voice of America special English broadcasts were free to them.
                    Schools would assign their students to go listen to the Voice of America in
                    English, not Chinese which was forbidden. Entire classes would listen to VOA at
                    night and come into the class next day to review the lesson they had heard. It
                    was remarkable. Often the content of special English programming was stories
                    about America, the founding fathers, etc. To this day in China, there are people
                    who know more than a lot of Americans do about Lincoln and Jefferson and
                    Washington. They have learned it from the Voice of America and discussed that
                    foreign history in their own schools as part of their language lessons. That
                    simple program concept is a marvelous tool in getting this country more
                    understood.</p>
                <p>The payoff is when the political forces become realigned and there is an opening,
                    a great welling up of interest in America. This is a very positive thing in
                    international relations because of this vast groundwork that was done through
                    Voice of America broadcasts to places like China in special English.</p>
                <p>Yet there was a serious problem. When reductions had to be taken and earmarking
                    prevented the reduction of one or several of the smaller services, then budget
                    cuts had to be made on the programming side. News was the heart of the program,
                    so that was sacrosanct. The natural instinct would be to take cuts in the
                    special purpose programming such as special English. You can't cut Lithuanian,
                    and you can't cut Latvian, and Tibetan is a new service that the Congress has
                    mandated. Radio Marti, over the objections of many, was going full force and
                    sucking money away as fast as it could. TV Marti was even worse. Yet the budget
                    was going down. Where do you take the cuts? Very, very important programs like
                    special English had to take a cut and that was tragic. Such cuts meant that we
                    were not using our money most efficiently and effectively. If you were a good
                    Lithuanian from Cleveland, you had very strong feelings about the importance of
                    Lithuania and you were probably right. But when you have limited resources and
                    unlimited demand, where do you put on your brakes? I think many times we put on
                    the brakes in the wrong places.</p>
                <p>You mentioned Cuba, and particularly in Florida, the vote down there. Cubans are
                    very strong in Florida. The log-rolling that goes on in Congress, of course,
                    made a careful analysis of the broadcast effort to Cuba almost impossible. The
                    principle of “you vote for my thing and I will vote for yours,” meant that the
                    Congressional delegation from Florida could jam an earmark through and force
                    funding of a program that many felt was not cost effective. Radio Marti was a
                    sacred cow and, more foolishly TV Marti, which has never had an audience,
                    quickly followed in that tradition. The whole thing was a Looney Toons
                    arrangement. You perhaps remember the aerostat balloons that they were going to
                    put up to broadcast television into Cuba. Fidel Castro said that if the U.S.
                    insisted on beginning such transmissions, he intended to increase the power of
                    one of Cuba's AM radio stations that would interfere with U.S. radio stations
                    deep in the U.S. heartland.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>With sufficient power, particularly in the evening hours, medium wave exhibits
                    some of the same characteristics as shortwave. Once the sun goes down, the
                    ionosphere comes down to a point where medium wave radio signals no longer
                    penetrate that layer of the ionosphere. That is why we have laws that restrict
                    broadcasting on certain frequencies. Some stations could broadcast from dawn to
                    dusk, but at dusk they had to power down or get off the air. The reason was that
                    they could easily interfere with a broadcast station on the same frequency that
                    presented no conflict during the day when distance alone kept them apart. AM
                    signals, usually receivable only within a small radius about a urban area, could
                    be heard 200 miles away after sundown. Anybody who ever lived in New England can
                    remember tuning in to WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia almost as soon as the sun
                    went down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I used to hear it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. The ionospheric shift is the reason why you heard it at night but not
                    during the day. Once the shift set in after sundown and the bounce came down in
                    the right spot, WWVA was loud and clear.</p>
                <p>TV Marti, of course, gets into the whole issue of the Berne Convention. The Berne
                    Convention is the set of rules and guidelines that the entire world uses to
                    allocate frequencies so that stations will be kept from running into each other
                    internationally. Radio waves don't respect national boundaries. They bounce all
                    over the place. Every couple of years, nations meet in Bern to decide who gets
                    what frequencies, so that we don't clash. That doesn't always work, but most
                    countries have laws prohibiting foreigners from broadcasting in their territory
                    through most of the radio spectrum. The particular exception, of course, is
                    shortwave radio which, by definition is international. Rupert Murdoch is a good
                    example of the application of that sort of law in the US. He had to become an
                    American citizen to buy into the American media.</p>
                <p>The fundamental question was whether or not our planned TV broadcasts into Cuba
                    were legal. The VOA legal watchers said “No.” Shortwave is the only recognized
                    medium for international radio broadcasting. Medium wave is not. There are some
                    border areas where two cities are in close proximity where some sort of
                    accommodation is necessary, but in general, medium wave is considered to be a
                    local signal intended for a national audience.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>Medium wave is a greater problem than FM signals, because a medium wave broadcast
                    can follow the curvature of the earth a bit even without a bounce. FM, on the
                    other hand, is direct, line-of-sight without any bounce. Signals from FM
                    broadcasts pass straight through the ionosphere without a bounce, no matter what
                    power is used at the transmitter. For hard technical reasons, if you can't see
                    the antenna, you are not going to hear the broadcast. That is a slight
                    exaggeration, for few people keep their eyes on their local TV or FM
                    broadcaster's antenna, but that is essentially the technical limitation of the
                    signal. For that reason, regional broadcasters of TV or FM need very tall
                    antennas. Your TV set may have ghosts or reflected signals, but it will not
                    receive over-the-horizon. This is the reason for the popularity of cable TV, as
                    those in the “shadow” of a hill or large building will still be able to receive
                    their favorite channels interference free.</p>
                <p>The Voice of America participates in the Berne discussions and the gentleman's
                    agreement to abide by the international conventions. So those gradations in the
                    radio frequency spectrum are important to the Voice of America, determining what
                    you can and cannot do. We have VOA medium wave broadcasts from Thailand, Costa
                    Rica, and Sri Lanka. Since local governments almost universally insist that VOA
                    not broadcast from its transmitters directly to local populations, how is it
                    that VOA broadcasts medium wave, FM, or TV anywhere?</p>
                <p>In fact, everyone looks the other way. Shortwave has an interesting technical
                    characteristic that jumps over the problem of local populations tuning in. In
                    the Philippines, for example, the Voice of America shortwave facility is very
                    hard to hear. If you go down to North Carolina where we have a large relay
                    station and turn a shortwave radio on, you can't hear the Voice of America, but
                    in more distant parts of the U.S. you can. Why? Because the average skip is
                    about 500 miles, and if you are within the radius of the first skip, there is no
                    signal to receive. Since shortwave is an international medium, engineers design
                    antennas to have a “take off” angle of elevation to maximize the feed of energy
                    into as narrow a beam as possible, thus placing the strongest possible signal on
                    the target area. Antennas must be designed so that you are not projecting your
                    energy to nearby areas at the expense of the target.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>That leaves the problems with Radio Marti and TV Marti. Cuba is a long way from
                    the continental US. It is even too far from the Florida Keys to permit a normal
                    broadcast station there. Searching for a solution, we talked to the National
                    Guard about TV Marti putting a television broadcast operation up in the air off
                    Cuba in international airspace to gain line-of-sight for the FM spectrum TV
                    signal. Naturally, power was a problem, for no aircraft today can carry enough
                    energy to power a truly effective TV broadcast operation, but a limited distance
                    broadcast would be possible for short time periods. The National Guard had
                    modified large cargo aircraft to broadcast radio and television from the air for
                    psychological warfare equipment. There is a unit in Pennsylvania that does
                    nothing but this. This is the psychological-warfare people, the clandestine
                    operators whose objectives are linked with battlefield or tactical advantages
                    and not the traditional overt USIA/VOA goals. The psychological-warfare people
                    used these aircraft during the problems in the Caribbean, Grenada, and places
                    like that. At that time, there was a question of how to get information to
                    Americans on the ground there.</p>
                <p>These aircraft were in fact used in Haiti. They would fly off the coast and make
                    lazy eights while broadcasting. Radio is not bad because it is non-directional.
                    You trail a wire out of the aircraft, and you can broadcast fairly easily for
                    long distances. Television is not so easy. You have a broader bandwidth to
                    broadcast, particularly in color, and much higher energy levels than are needed
                    for radio broadcasting. So for TV signals, the National Guard was willing, even
                    enthusiastic, to give it a try, a gutsy “can-do” spirit, but technically
                    goofy.</p>
                <p>After the possibility of a National Guard transport flying off Cuba was rejected,
                    the question of aerostat balloons came to the fore. A few “visionaries” wanted
                    to put up balloons with long wire antennas on them. Since TV operates in the FM
                    spectrum, you have to have a line of sight. They designed a system of aerostat
                    balloons that would be put up from islands in the Florida Keys from which a very
                    high antenna would, theoretically, gain a line-of-sight with Cuba. Of course,
                    that is an area of frequent and sometimes violent storms. No problem, said the
                    advocates, the balloons could simply be hauled down and re-raised when the
                    threat had passed. Surely that would mean that TV Marti would be off the air
                    whenever the weather threatened, but they were undaunted.</p>
                <p>At great cost ($30,000,000 was earmarked for the first year budget from the
                    Congress - naturally taken from the general appropriation for VOA
                    modernization), the project was launched. Balloons blew down. It got comical in
                    some cases. The engineers swore that the project was technically unfeasible, and
                    the legal people said we were ignoring international agreements to which the
                    U.S. was a party, but politics prevailed and the bleeding of money continued.
                    There was intense congressional pressure to make TV Marti a reality despite the
                    sense of farce. To our embarrassment, it was created and is still running. To
                    this day, the best information I have claims that it is a total waste of money
                    and probably cannot be heard in Cuba.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>TV is not like a radio where you have a dial that you can run along the spectrum.
                    Either you override signals that are already there or interfere with them, which
                    is a blatant violation of international convention, or you pick channels that
                    are not used to which people don't listen. So you are stuck on the television
                    format. Additionally, putting out a television signal is very difficult. If you
                    use the airplanes, there has to be one up all the time. That also means every
                    time an airplane makes a turn, your signal disappears, so you are not be able to
                    follow the program. It will finally come back so you can see it again, it is so
                    highly directional. Balloons keep falling out of the sky, and there are a host
                    of other technical problems.</p>
                <p>But Congress could not or chose not to understand this. The only thing they had
                    on their agenda was the Cuban vote in Miami; everything else was marginal. They
                    took money out of the construction program, which delayed our sites abroad, to
                    put it into Radio Marti and more wastefully, TV Marti. This meant millions of
                    dollars committed for constructing relay stations abroad that we did need, were
                    put into something we didn't need and probably would never make successful. We
                    all knew that. But our political system being what it is and the inability or
                    unwillingness of the Congressional staffers to understand these concepts was our
                    downfall on this particular question.</p>
                <p>I am trying to get back to the point I was trying to make when I started: our
                    failing as an agency has been in Washington where we have not often had a full
                    hearing on what USIA/USIS and the Voice were really doing and what the real
                    value of our contributions were. In part, some of our problems were inherent in
                    the manner in which the federal government operates. For example, we were
                    hobbled by political appointees who, at times, were substandard and possibly
                    even dumped in USIA when they did not make the grade in other agencies. It was
                    always easy to get somebody out of one's hair by planting them where they would
                    handle overseas activities. You couldn't put them in the Labor Department where
                    somebody would see them. That was too bad, because it meant the professionals in
                    USIA lost control and were saddled with people who did not know what they were
                    doing. Some of them were nice people, but nevertheless, had no clue what we were
                    doing abroad. Worse, they could not grasp the sense of mission, excitement, even
                    duty, that kept the professional corps at work despite the senseless cuts, the
                    petty politics, and the constant Congressional ham-handedness that afflicted the
                    agency. That loss of the ideal essentially killed USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's move on. You took Chinese. Can you tell me a
                        bit about Chinese training? It was from when to when and what was your
                        impression of the course?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>YATES: I am not a great linguist to start with. The irony of my situation is that
                    my three languages are Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. I had studied Japanese in
                    University of Maryland courses while I was in the Army. I spoke enough of that
                    to get along. My Korean was pretty good by the time I left Korea in 1972.
                    Chinese, however, was a different animal. It is a very different language, not
                    related to either Japanese or Korean, which have, in fact, a distant
                    relationship between themselves. The Chinese is tonal and in word order and
                    grammar resembles English more than it does Japanese, except for the characters
                    that the Japanese picked up from the Chinese. The ideographs are one of the big
                    problems for an English speaker, as he has to learn a whole different concept of
                    written language. There is no phonetic alphabet in Chinese. They have created a
                    Romanized equivalent system called “pinyin,” which is supposedly a crutch for
                    foreigners, but in fact, may even get in the way. Some linguists have tried
                    teaching only the Chinese characters, the ideographic approach. That is almost
                    impossible, because if you are a well versed Chinese scholarly person, you would
                    have at least 10,000 of those “drawings” under your belt. The Japanese have a
                    limited set of about 1450 they call Toyo Kanji which allows you to read most
                    sentences in newspapers, without the names of people and places that require a
                    specialized vocabulary of their own. But one important difference between the
                    Japanese and Chinese writing systems is the phonetic system the Japanese use to
                    represent inflections and other mechanical parts of their language not present
                    in the Chinese.</p>
                <p>That phonetic system is called “kana.” It is broken into two separate subsystems,
                    “hiragana,” the style of the usual inflections and language parts, and
                    “katakana” the system that is used to phoneticize foreign names. The problem
                    with the utilization of Chinese ideographs with the Japanese language is the
                    dramatic number of homonyms that were forced into a language with only 50 sounds
                    to represent the tens of thousands of Chinese characters. Since the Chinese
                    ideographs carry the meaning in the visual presentation and were created for a
                    language with different tones that can be applied to each phonetic group, the
                    problem of homonyms is not as great. When the Japanese, who do not have a tonal
                    system, adopted the Chinese characters as part of their writing system, they
                    carried over close equivalences in sound, but without the tonal distinctions.
                    Hence, the great difficulty with homonyms.</p>
                <p>The kana, on the other hand, allow you to keep on reading when you hit an unknown
                    Chinese character and still get the gist of the sentence. You may have to
                    substitute a verb or noun, but the basic structure of the sentence is clear.
                    Korean is even more consistent in the use of phonetic representation. Hangul is
                    their name for a phonetic representation, and there was a time when most
                    government documents had no Chinese characters at all. Yet without the certainty
                    of a Chinese character, there is still some possible confusion in written
                    Korean. The Korean government has relented on that and Chinese characters have
                    been re-introduced in government documents and into the educational system. They
                    never were really removed from the names of people and places, but in normal
                    language their use had been cut dramatically. So you can read Korean after you
                    have a command of Hangul, which is a syllabary more than an alphabet, for it is
                    represented by symbols grouped into representations of sounds.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>So Chinese has many problems for the student. You have problems with the tones.
                    If you misuse tones, you are unintelligible in Chinese. The second problem in
                    Chinese is that you have a lot of dialects. If you go to Shanghai speaking
                    Putongwha, which is the standard Mandarin, they could figure out what you were
                    talking about, but the two dialects are not like Spanish and Portuguese, they
                    are much more different. In either Shanghai or Beijing, people can read anything
                    written by the other.</p>
                <p>Still, writing with Chinese ideographs is a greater hurdle than reading, because
                    it is an art form as well as a means of communication. You recall Mao Zedong and
                    his little red book. Why a little red book? The reason was because Mao Zedong
                    could not be understood by 90 percent of the people who lived in his country.
                    His Hunan dialect was so strong that even people in Beijing could not understand
                    what the devil he was saying. That is why he never gave speeches. If you have
                    seen the newsreels of the time, you rarely heard Mao Zedong speaking. He might
                    be filmed giving a speech, but it would be voiced over even for the Chinese
                    audience. He gave few public speeches, for when he did, people often laughed at
                    him. His country roots showed. Hunanese is different from other dialects and
                    made him appear a “rube.” Traveling even short distances in China will bring you
                    to a wholly different dialect. Mandarin is now the national standard, and most
                    educated people have no problem with it. Yet if you go into the countryside, it
                    is possible to find those who speak no Mandarin and do not understand its spoken
                    form.</p>
                <p>I entered the fray off schedule. I wanted to go to China because my wife, after
                    taking Chinese studies at George Washington University, had just gotten a degree
                    and was interested in going to China. I had bid on the job as PAO in Taipei, but
                    that didn't work out. However, the spot as Deputy PAO suddenly became available
                    in Beijing. I was picked for the job, and it meant I had to go into language
                    training immediately, because the incumbent was leaving. This meant I was
                    off-cycle from the usual startup of classes at the Foreign Service Institute,
                    then in Rosslyn. Because of my Japanese and Korean background, they sent me to
                    ICLS (the International Center for Language Studies) to try to use the extra
                    time to brush up on my earlier study of Chinese characters. ICLS was a private
                    school near the Treasury Building on 15th Street in downtown Washington. I think
                    it is gone now.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>The way ICLS worked was to hire mostly students studying in the Washington area
                    who would agree to work a certain number of hours a week to support themselves
                    in their studies. They were not really trained language teachers. I went there
                    and started trying to get some of my Japanese Kanji and some of my few Korean
                    Hanmun converted into Chinese characters. While the systems are similar, they
                    use different techniques in writing. The Chinese use a simplified version of
                    characters that the Japanese no longer use. The Japanese have simplified some,
                    but simplified them differently. So you have the three languages. Korean is
                    somewhere in the middle, using some of the older, more complex characters which
                    the Chinese have now simplified. So you have simplified Chinese, you have the
                    traditional Chinese which is used in Hong Kong and Taipei, and then you have the
                    Korean style and the Japanese style. So it is a mishmash of stuff. The
                    pronunciation is sometimes related, but while it is close enough to readily
                    confuse, it is not always close enough to be understood. So you can't speak
                    Japanese in China. It doesn't work. You can't do it in Korea either.</p>
                <p>I was confronted with that and spent a couple of months of struggle. Then I
                    shifted over to FSI and started basic Chinese there. I came into my basic
                    Chinese studies with one foot half in and one foot half out. My spoken Chinese
                    was almost zero, but my written Chinese was getting along pretty well. So it
                    made for much confusion. My instructors decided to emphasize my written
                    abilities, but that didn't work out too well. Finally, in exasperation, I went
                    back to ICLS to try to sort out my unique set of problems where I did not have
                    to march to the beat of other students. Then Tiananmen occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you explain what Tiananmen was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Tiananmen was the student movement in Beijing in 1989. At the time,
                    Gorbachev was visiting Beijing, and there was a large number of American and
                    other international media there. An uprising of students in Tiananmen Square in
                    central Beijing quickly got out of hand. It was broadcast virtually live to the
                    world, because of the foreign media presence. I was in Washington trying to
                    study Chinese with distraught Chinese instructors who had family, friends, and
                    neighbors involved. I would go to school in the morning, and we would sit and
                    watch television coverage in Tiananmen Square. So I didn't learn a lot of
                    Chinese at ICLS at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>The incident, however, certainly brought home to me some of the emotional and
                    cultural problems of the younger Chinese generation that were related to the
                    incident. The uprising was broken up militarily and with cruelty that was
                    shocking to the viewers abroad. The decision to do that was obviously a hard one
                    for the Chinese government. I think the Chinese leadership did not really
                    understand how much of this was getting abroad, and when they finally came to a
                    realization of how much was getting out, they tried to pull the plug. There was
                    that famous incident where the Chinese authorities confronted American
                    technicians from CNN in a hotel room and ordered them to pull the plug on the
                    camera. It was quite a dramatic scene in international press history. But that
                    sort of excitement really screwed up my Chinese study. Consequently, I did not
                    gain much proficiency in the language. I studied Chinese for less than a year
                    and then went off to Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Beijing from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It was June when the uprising started and ran for about a month. They had
                    evacuated non-essential Americans from Beijing. That meant my wife couldn't go
                    in with me. I was given the green light to go ahead in August, 1989 and remained
                    there until 1992.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I was Deputy Public Affairs Officer. It was an interesting time to be in
                    that position. I went into China through Guangzhou, also called “Canton.” I flew
                    there through Hong Kong, leaving my wife to spend some time with her family in
                    Korea, because the evacuation order had not been lifted by that time.</p>
                <p>The Deputy Public Affairs Officer in China had responsibility for all the USIS
                    branches. We had four: in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Chengdu. At the
                    time, we had no branch in Beijing, but we did have our headquarters there. That
                    was later rectified. However, coming in through Guangzhou was important to me,
                    because I had spent time on a couple of occasions before in Hong Kong. When you
                    went to Hong Kong in those days, you would go up to the border and look across.
                    So that part of my introduction to China was fun. I took the train in and was
                    first struck by the lack of transition between the modernity and the expected
                    antiquity of Guangzhou. It wasn't as shiny as Hong Kong, but it certainly wasn't
                    so far away in terms of appearance. I looked for the “blue ants” but could not
                    find them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Blue ants being?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>YATES: The stereotypical concept of the Chinese people, marching in lines all
                    wearing a blue uniform with a red star on the cap. It wasn't that way at all.
                    Guangzhou was a bustling place in 1989 and was exploding with economic activity.
                    The place was a mess with construction. We had a USIS Center at the Garden Hotel
                    with a residence for the Director at the White Swan Hotel, at one time, the most
                    elegant hotel in Guangzhou. It had been quickly overtaken by the building of
                    magnificent new hotels. The White Swan was right on the river, next to where
                    they were putting a tunnel under the harbor. The hotel had been used by an
                    American oil company for years, so right next door was a petroleum dump which
                    was probably dangerous, and certainly unsightly. It was on an island in the
                    Pearl River, slightly off the mainland. You had to cross several bridges to get
                    to it. That location was probably chosen in earlier days when foreigners were
                    looked on as a threat to the Chinese social order. On an island, the foreigners
                    could be contained.</p>
                <p>If you recall the Japanese history of Nagasaki, they put the Dutch on an island
                    called “Dejima,” apart from the rest of Japan, so they could essentially stand
                    by the bridge and make sure the nasty Dutch didn't get into the real country.
                    The Chinese probably had something like that in mind for the intruding
                    Americans. Because the White Swan Hotel was on an island, it made the process
                    very difficult for people to get to and, of course, made it very easy for the
                    Chinese to control who got in and who got out. Nonetheless, it was a reasonably
                    comfortable life for the people who lived there.</p>
                <p>The most striking thing about Guangzhou when I went in was the accessibility of
                    the people. On my first couple of days, I took a walk with the Branch Public
                    Affairs Officer there. He knew where there was what they call an “English
                    Corner” in the city during the weekend. We visited and I spent two or three
                    hours standing and talking with students about anything that came into their
                    heads. The Voice of America, what America was like, was the Washington Post
                    really a “government” newspaper, and all kinds of interesting and sometimes
                    surprisingly sophisticated questions. These were students who just wanted to
                    practice English, but the substance and tenor of their questions had an edge.
                    There were informers among them. You could see that every once in a while, they
                    would look around to see who was listening and who wasn't. Most of them just
                    didn't care. There in the park in Guangzhou I found a feisty Chinese spirit
                    which I was a little bit surprised to see. Maybe I should have known better,
                    because I had been in Korea, but the Chinese also are very independent-minded
                    people. They are certainly not the “Blue Ants” and probably never were. That
                    image, one of the “Scratches on Our Minds,” came out of our MovieTone version of
                    Chinese history. Peasants and people in the countryside who are not generally
                    affected by these political tides may be willing to go along with the emperors
                    in Beijing. The old Chinese saying, “Heaven is high and the emperor is far
                    away,” was probably one of the most characteristic things about the country, at
                    least in Guangzhou. And the people in Guangzhou certainly were open. We talked
                    freely about a large number of issues in that short period of time on a Sunday
                    afternoon in the park in Guangzhou.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>The questions flew. I stood in the middle of a big circle and the Branch PAO
                    stood in the middle of another circle. There were not very many Americans
                    running around China at the time, so we were centers of much attraction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived at Tiananmen, were you under any U.S.
                        government constraints? We were pretty unhappy with the government of China
                        for what they had done there and China was being made a pariah at that
                        point. Were there any instructions on how to deal with the Chinese at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Not in that sense, no. I had been in the Foreign Service for a long time
                    and didn't have to be told to be careful when living abroad. You don't get out
                    in front of things, and you are a government official regardless of your
                    personal feelings. But my job and the job of the people I worked with, was not
                    to pull the covers over our heads and sulk in the corner. I was there to find
                    out what was going on and to find out whom we could talk to, to make solid
                    contacts, and find a way to make them continue.</p>
                <p>For example, the Chinese had at that time put the squash on the Fulbright
                    program. Most of the Fulbright grantees had left out of concern for their own
                    safety. Many of the American English teachers had left. At the time, the Chinese
                    accused us of plotting this, that the Fulbrighters had been told to leave by the
                    American government and the Chinese really believed that. It was not true and we
                    knew that, but they were not willing to accept our word on that issue as truth.
                    Their view was not a matter of dogma. In their society, if the government
                    doesn't want something to happen, it does not. If the government does want
                    something to happen, it does. Most Chinese officials generally assumed that in
                    the U.S., it works the same way. Since all of the Fulbrighters decamped, as well
                    as many of the private English teachers, the assumption was the U.S. government
                    orchestrated it, particularly since the U.S. had arranged for evacuation flights
                    that were available to the people who wanted to leave Beijing.</p>
                <p>The Chinese understanding of this was that we were ordering Americans out of
                    China, but it never was required. We can't morally tell an American where to go.
                    We can advise and make it possible for them to leave. In fact, the jets that
                    were chartered did not always leave full. There were a lot of people who stayed
                    in China and did not want to leave. The Chinese should have looked around a
                    little bit and done a bit more inquiry, but they were very unhappy with the way
                    the American government had carried out the evacuation and were not shy in
                    expressing their displeasure. The Chinese were also very unhappy about the role
                    of the Voice of America in Tiananmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the Chinese in that context, you are talking
                        about the about Chinese government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes, certainly the Chinese government. But you also have to understand
                    something that is characteristic of other parts of Asia as well. There are a lot
                    of people in China who are what we would call patriotic, the Radical Right, who
                    are true-blue, flag- waving, nationalistic people who believe in the dogma that
                    we find so reprehensible. Our image of that dogma is colored by our own
                    understanding of it, and it is not always very clear. Remember back in the John
                    Stewart Service days after the Second World War, when we went through this whole
                    business about China? He and other American diplomats in China had seen in China
                    something that others, particularly the American media, either didn't see or
                    were not willing to admit.</p>
                <p>They understood that China was a communist nation and the communists were in
                    control, but the Chinese were still Chinese in feelings, outlook, and
                    prejudices. It must be recalled that the American government in its actions
                    following the Second World War was not very well informed about what was going
                    on in China. When Foreign Service folk like Service tried to shed some light on
                    it, they were soundly and swiftly booted out under charges of all kinds of dark
                    motives and as being closely sympathetic to the “red” cause. That action caused
                    much trouble for the American nation in the years following, for not only was it
                    bad scholarship, it was bad faith in the very American principles the long
                    Second World War had been fought over.</p>
                <p>The attitude of the Chinese people had to be divorced from that of the
                    government, but the Chinese shared a perception of the U.S. which is not always
                    what we would understand. We think of the masses in chains as a kind of concept
                    that represents an oppressed people. As soon as you unlock the chains, they are
                    going to run free. That is not the case. In fact, that happened during the
                    Tiananmen incident. One of the fundamental rationales that was used by the
                    Chinese government in suppressing the students was the prevention of anarchy.
                    Any student of Chinese history can look back and see an incredible amount of
                    anarchy in the past which has destroyed the nation, or at least led to darkness
                    many times. Many regimes fell because of disillusion among the people and
                    resulting chaos. That is the basic reason so many of the people in the
                    countryside did not support what the students were doing in the city.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>Seventy percent of the Chinese people live in the country. It doesn't take a
                    rocket scientist to figure out that if much of that seventy percent didn't like
                    what was going on, it would not be long before an effort was made to turn it
                    off. If you have thirty percent of the population, that is most of the urban,
                    educated Chinese, in support, you can make a big dent. And they did. But it
                    wasn't enough to prevail, and it had no chance of being enough. Remember again
                    in Chinese history, Mao Zedong's revolution occurred not in the city but in the
                    countryside. It was his ability to organize the peasants that made the
                    revolution possible. It was Mao Zedong's use of that technique which made it
                    successful. In Shanghai, where the communists really started in the early part
                    of the century, certainly after the 1918 revolution in Russia, the movement
                    there was city-bound. It had no success whatsoever in China. There was a lot of
                    politics, a lot of running around, but there wasn't any real success until Mao
                    Zedong came onto the scene and organized the peasants. When those peasants were
                    brought together, that was the first time that their movement stood a chance. If
                    you don't bother the peasants, the Chinese government will continue. The
                    demonstration in Tiananmen Square was not a mass revolt.</p>
                <p>To say China was in chains is a metaphor that comes readily to hand, and there
                    certainly were economic chains, but I am not sure you can say there were
                    political chains. After about three years living and working in the country, I
                    certainly do not have enough information to draw firm conclusions, and most
                    media do not either. The political chains in effect were most evident in the
                    cities. The countryside was still much like the old China, with the old
                    attitudes. The farmers did not like collective farms, and that was clearly an
                    episode in Chinese history that made the countryside unhappy, but that was the
                    first thing to go under the reforms. The old rural collectives are essentially
                    gone, transformed into private plots or coops where there are not enough
                    resources to support smaller farms.</p>
                <p>It was not until Deng Xiaoping freed the farmers to do their own thing, sell
                    their own produce, and invest their own accumulating capital that the
                    countryside began to prosper relative to the cities. That is where capitalism
                    started in China, not in the industrial zones or in the urban areas. The large
                    state-owned industries were dead in many cases and some still hang on in a
                    morbid state of preservation. It was in the countryside where the farmers began
                    to produce their own goods and foster the return of capitalism to Chinese soil.
                    Deng Xiaoping and his policy was in the Mao Zedong tradition of looking at the
                    Chinese peasant as the source of change in China. He was also probably accurate,
                    in his terms, that the rebellion in Beijing had to be put down, because it would
                    have engendered chaos, a loss of confidence by the large rural population in
                    China. In 1989 when Tiananmen occurred, even some of the students were in
                    agreement that the demonstrations had to be shut down. The question was, how far
                    could the government let it go?</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>When the industrial workers, the media, and some of the government agency people
                    began to march in the square, the glove had been thrown down. Probably from the
                    standpoint of the demonstrators, that was the mistake that destroyed the
                    movement. Lacking the support of others in Beijing who were largely government
                    workers, the movement was dying. Things were fizzling, because it was wet out in
                    the square, it was cold, there were hunger strikers, and things were not good,
                    they were beginning to fall apart. It was not until some of the major elements
                    in Beijing, workers groups, got involved for a variety of their own reasons that
                    the troops were brought heavily to bear. If you remember, when the first advance
                    of troops tried to enter the square, they were turned around by the citizens of
                    Beijing, as it were, simply getting in the way.</p>
                <p>A lot of these first troops lived in the city. It wasn't until they brought
                    troops from elsewhere, troops not related to the garrison around Beijing, that
                    they were able to put full military force on the students. And even then, you
                    remember the line of tanks with a single student waving his book bag; he stopped
                    the whole line until the driver popped out of the turret and said “Get out of
                    the way.” The tank tried to go around him and could not, so the whole column
                    stopped. A famous picture.</p>
                <p>Why did the column stop? This was a fly in front of them compared to the events
                    surrounding the square. What prevented the commander from running over him and
                    continuing to the square, like all tyrants would have done? They stopped.
                    American television made much of the courage of the student. There was no
                    question he had a lot of courage and was a strong individual. But don't forget
                    the soldier who had the controls in the tank and stopped and the tank commander
                    who said, “No, don't run him over.” What possessed that tank commander? I
                    believe the reason was that the Chinese have an ethic which runs deeper than the
                    roots of communism and military training and transcends all else, bringing the
                    column to a halt. They do have respect for the individual. There are billions of
                    individuals. That is not seen very much in our media concept of the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we should come back to your time. What was your
                        impression of the consulate general in Guangzhou?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>YATES: As I mentioned, it was isolated. At that time, the Chinese had cut off
                    most relations with Americans. We had been shut out. You couldn't get meetings
                    with people, you couldn't move around. There were all kinds of excuses: “I'm
                    busy. It's inconvenient today, maybe some other day,” etc. But the bottom line
                    was, you didn't get meetings with people. We were building a Guangzhou USIS
                    Center at another hotel, the Garden Hotel, apart from the consulate. It was
                    largely finished by the time I arrived. The Branch PAO and I looked at the
                    place. The installation had some flaws, but it was well located. It was
                    essentially in a store front inside the hotel on the mezzanine level. The
                    problem was, it was not downtown on a street corner, so it meant rag-a-muffin
                    students would be uncomfortable in that place. Yet it was good for young
                    professionals, intellectuals, and people who had some cachet in the government
                    and who found it an interesting, clean, and different place to go. So it
                    probably was as good as we could have obtained, given the political situation of
                    the time.</p>
                <p>In the new USIS Center at the Garden Hotel, we were not confined to the island,
                    where we were apart. Although there was a great effort to “save” some undefined
                    resources and move back onto the isolated island, that move would have been
                    disastrous for a public affairs program. The Garden Hotel was expensive, but
                    given that it was the only chance we had to get to people, that was a good
                    move.</p>
                <p>On several occasions in my trips to Guangzhou, I participated in a series of
                    programs in which the Branch PAO was bringing in Americans who lived in the town
                    to meet with Chinese. The reason was ostensibly to study English, but the young
                    professionals, doctors, business people, graduate students, and even a couple of
                    lawyers all had very wide interests. They were not a large group, 15-20, maybe
                    30, people at a time. Their English was fair, and they wanted to know about
                    America. The Chinese are always interested in your personal life. On a later
                    occasion, I was one of the Americans who went down there and sat with a group of
                    young professionals and talked about life in America, politics, what Americans
                    think about, freedom and liberty and all those good things which we never
                    dreamed the Chinese would be allowed to talk about. Because it was a foreign
                    environment, they felt a little bit more at ease, although there were obviously
                    people among them who were reporting back on who was saying what and what
                    questions were asked. That was deemed to be acceptable to the participants,
                    perhaps because the “watchers” were relatives or friends.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>I think those programs went a long way in helping to reach people who we would
                    later call agenda setters. The branch in Guangzhou was important. Guangzhou is
                    different from the rest of the country. People there were not interested in
                    politics. It is a culture with a different language and culture. Guangzhou was
                    the source of a lot of people who came to the US, so many people there had
                    relatives in America in one place or another. That gives Americans, I guess, a
                    special entree. But at that time, it was difficult for us to program speakers in
                    Guangzhou, because they didn't want to talk about politics. They would talk
                    about business. You could bring in an economics speaker and have wall-to-wall
                    people. You would try to bring somebody in concerned with politics, and you
                    wouldn't get anywhere. So we had to confine ourselves pretty much to economic
                    questions in Guangzhou.</p>
                <p>From there, I moved up to Shanghai on my initial trip to Beijing. Shanghai is a
                    different city and had a different kind of clientele. As Deputy PAO, I had
                    responsibility for a book-translation program that, interestingly enough, was
                    started by John King Fairbank back in the late '40s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He later became a “father” of Chinese studies at
                        Harvard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: He is the grand old man of Chinese studies in the US. He wrote one of the
                    best books on Chinese history available to American students. In the '40s, he
                    started a book translation program. There were 18 titles in his original
                    program, and the process was essentially to pick titles, translate them into
                    Chinese, and pass them out. I inherited a variation of that program in Beijing
                    and had a fair amount of dealings with various publishers across China. In
                    Shanghai, there were several large publishing houses that we were doing business
                    with, so I became much more familiar with Shanghai than I did with some of the
                    other cities.</p>
                <p>Shanghai is to Beijing about what New York is to Washington in the US. It is the
                    commercial capital of northern China. Guangzhou is the commercial capital of the
                    south. Shanghai has the biggest port and the strongest connections with the
                    West. That city was home to a large number of expatriates prior to the Second
                    World War, and the famous Bund is exemplary of a European colonial seaport
                    street. Most people would remember that Shanghai of the old bank buildings, the
                    customs house, and the old colonial appearance that provided the live set for
                    period movies. It was in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Shanghai that the
                    communist movement found its origins.</p>
                <p>The Branch PAO in Shanghai has probably as much responsibility as most small
                    country Public Affair Officers in the world because of the strength of the
                    community and the size of the problem we deal with. It was the place where we
                    had our last U.S. military ship visit, for example, before our relations fell
                    apart. Those visits, by the way, have just started again. There was a burgeoning
                    opening in a Shanghai that was under restraint, but nonetheless possessed the
                    latent possibilities for a very productive program since there was such an
                    enormous interest in international affairs and trade.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>That is also where I met a number of Chinese lawyers who thought they had a
                    chance of making a dent in the Chinese legal system, which essentially did not
                    exist. China doesn't have a system like we have. They have no tradition of a
                    rule of law that we would recognize and that is so sacred to our own way of
                    living. In China, society is ruled by fiat or something resembling a Germanic
                    code. If somebody has to make a decision on someone doing something wrong, it is
                    done by judge, not by a jury of peers. Equality before the law is not a concept
                    that is common in China. So lawyers have a problem. There are laws, but they are
                    aimed at regulating process in the society rather than to moderate social
                    actions by individuals. Most people are untouched by laws other than traffic
                    regulations and a few political dicta. Otherwise they are not generally aware of
                    a concept of equality before the law. As law becomes more of a way of operating
                    both business and social discourse, legal people become more important. Shanghai
                    is where that effort is beginning.</p>
                <p>We had problems in Shanghai because our USIS office was on the consulate grounds.
                    One of the problems of all consulates in China is that they are surrounded by
                    guards. After Tiananmen, steel helmeted, automatic-weapons-equipped troops were
                    stationed about every 15-20 feet in a ring around the consulate compound. It
                    wasn't something that would encourage people to come in to participate in public
                    affairs programs.</p>
                <p>We also had a problem with being part of the consulate, because it attracted
                    enormous numbers of people just wanting visas. Shanghai is the business center
                    of the north, and there were always a lot of people wanting to get visas. Every
                    morning, there was a long line outside. It was like a railroad station every
                    day. It was not very easy for distinguished people to come in and go to a
                    program at the USIS Center. Our facilities at the consulate were in a “shed” at
                    the back of the property, literally above a large storage space. They were
                    totally unsuitable for us. To get to our offices, staff and guests had to walk
                    through the consulate gates, past the main building, and down through the
                    consulate garden. This route, of course, drove the security people wild.
                    Arriving at the USIS offices one had to go through a portal where there were
                    sheets of plywood lying around, a fork lift vehicle, and other items used to
                    maintain the embassy. Then you had to walk up a flight of stairs, above one of
                    the storerooms into a kind of “garret” arrangement where we had our program
                    facilities and a library. Having the library in that sort of situation was not
                    very smart, since nobody ran such gauntlet to visit a library.</p>
                <p>So we had to get offices outside. As soon as I arrived, it was abundantly clear
                    and the Consul General at the time agreed that we had to have different
                    facilities. So we started our search for quarters. We did find something pretty
                    close to the consulate, but in an independent building with no overbearing
                    security control, at least not with automatic weapons and tin hats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the security control designed to discourage Chinese
                        from coming to the post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>YATES: That and more, for it was also, I believe, designed to keep us in. To keep
                    an eye on us. The Chinese were very suspicious of Americans in China at the
                    time. They weren't protecting us because nothing dire happened in China without
                    official blessing, so if our “protectors” wanted to turn their weapons on us, we
                    had no security at all. If they wanted to come in, they would come in. It was
                    clear that if the Chinese government (� la Iran) decided that the students
                    should give the Americans their comeuppance, we were naked there in the wind.
                    They were not protecting us much. Perhaps because of the very severe penalties
                    for robbing or harming a foreigner in China, we were not bothered much by
                    burglaries or other criminal threats. It was at once secure and not secure.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Chinese forces surrounding us were there to control
                    Chinese access to us. Every Chinese person who approached the consulate was
                    stopped by the Chinese guards and asked what they wanted. Their names and
                    “danwei” membership was recorded. A “danwei” is a work unit. Their unit
                    identification was looked at, and it was reported back to their superiors what
                    they were up to. So it wasn't easy for a Chinese citizen to walk up to the
                    consulate and go in unless he had an official reason to do so. Usually they
                    required an official letter from us and official approval from their danwei to
                    make a visit. So they had pretty strong locks on their citizenry. It wasn't
                    always successful in keeping people out, and we tried to the extent possible to
                    make it easier for people to enter. Yet being at the consulate really kept us
                    out of the mainstream. So we had to move out. Once I had looked into the issue
                    of the book publishing program in Shanghai, I was free to begin to look into the
                    access problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were books selected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That was a program I ran after I got to Beijing. When I arrived, it had
                    close to a 100 titles in process of some sort or eitherunder consideration, had
                    been published, or were in the process of being worked on. The process was a
                    little complicated. We did the translations in Beijing itself. The basic
                    principle of the program was to put the best of American writing in the hands of
                    Chinese in a manner that most educated people could access. We didn't have a lot
                    of money to use for the project, but what we could offer the Chinese was an
                    ability to find good materials that were worthy of translation and assist them
                    in bringing a translation to print. We would buy the first 2,000 volumes of the
                    resulting Chinese edition, hard bound. This was not a big money-making operation
                    for publishers, but it did provide U.S. dollars, hard currency, which most of
                    them put into Hong Kong accounts.</p>
                <p>We had about 32 Chinese publishers who were in the program. Among them was the
                    People's Liberation Army Press, and this caused me a bit of surprise.
                    Particularly in the aftermath of Tiananmen, what was the People's Liberation
                    Army Press doing publishing USIS selected American titles in Chinese and selling
                    them in the market? The Chinese, on the other hand, saw nothing amiss, but did
                    prefer to stay solely on military biographies and military issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>One of the characteristics of this program was that we would provide the material
                    and buying the translation rights, if needed, through USIA in Washington. Once
                    we had the rights, we would enter into a commercial contractual arrangement with
                    the Chinese publisher, giving them an up-front payment for about 2,000 volumes.
                    This didn't amount to much money, because in China books are pretty cheap,
                    thirty to forty cents a copy. Sometimes we would contribute to the translation
                    costs, but not very often. We tried to make it as much of a commercial operation
                    as possible.</p>
                <p>The company would translate the volume with people we approved as translators,
                    give us a manuscript of the translation. We would then send it to Hong Kong
                    where Chinese who were not communists would take a look at it to make sure it
                    was a good translation, the language was appropriate to the text and that it was
                    done in a manner we could put our name to. Not all of them got through. As a
                    matter of fact, about half of them didn't. They were heavily edited in Hong Kong
                    and sent back to the publisher through us for reworking. When a final approval
                    of the manuscript came back from Hong Kong, the publisher would publish the book
                    and we would take our copies. The other copies of the book would then be put on
                    sale in the Chinese market, with all profits going to the Chinese publisher. In
                    the case of the Peoples' Liberation Army Press, we expected most copies would be
                    handled through military channels, but that was fine with us since the military
                    was the most natural audience for the kinds of things put into translation.
                    Commercial publishers put a fair number of the titles out through the Chinese
                    commercial distribution system. One might suspect that the publishers simply
                    pocketed the hard dollars we paid and dumped the rest of the run, but we did
                    random checks of book stores and government outlets to see if our titles were
                    making it out.</p>
                <p>And, that happened. I was in Nanning a couple of years later and took some extra
                    time to wander in the local bookstores. That was one of my habits as I traveled
                    about China. Nanning is way down by the Vietnamese border, far off the beaten
                    track. There were not even very many tourists there, certainly not very many
                    Americans. I was down there for a conference. If time allowed, I would would
                    prowl around the bookstores and look for our titles in each city I visited. And,
                    sure enough, I found one of our translated titles on American nuclear policy in
                    a bookshop in Nanning. That to me was very gratifying. It showed the books were
                    getting out and were available to the Chinese to buy if they had the money.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Usually the publisher would put out a hardback edition as the first 2,000 or so
                    copies that we purchased as part of the publication agreement. We used those
                    copies for presentations when we made visits to Chinese offices. In most of
                    Asia, people have a great deal of respect for the printed word. If you can give
                    a person a gift of books, that is a compliment to them, because you are
                    acknowledging that they have the intellectual prowess to have an interest in
                    serious work. They often would place them in a prominent bookcase in their
                    office or take them home to enjoy in private. Always they were apppreciated.
                    Books on the shelf of one's home were the mark of an intellectual man. So the
                    2,000 copies that we received were used by our Beijing Officers and Branch
                    Officers as gifts. The rest of the print run, however, usually was prepared in
                    paperback binding because they were cheaper for the individual to purchase.</p>
                <p>We had about 100 titles which were chosen by us. My role was to select titles,
                    approach publishers who might have a special interest in that subject matter,
                    and make an offer to have the title published. In regard to the selection
                    process, we gathered ideas from various sources. For example, we had a
                    Fulbrighter who was working up in Shenyang at a university. She was in Beijing
                    for a visit and said one of the things that surprised her a lot in teaching
                    about America was the enormous interest in the American West and American
                    Indians in particular. The Chinese seemed to take to this idea of a frontier
                    mentality. Possibly it was the romance of the noble Indian that attracted them.
                    So out of that comment grew the idea to put together a series on the American
                    West in translation into Chinese, which we did. Everything from Larry McMurtry
                    right back to some Indian writers, Indian poetry. The Fulbrighter agreed to help
                    compile a short list of titles that would appeal most to her students. Her final
                    list was edited a bit and then shown to a number of publishers who were asked if
                    they would be interested in doing a series. In Asia, as in many other countries,
                    people like to collect things in series. This was to become a series on the
                    American West. A publisher was selected and the series got under way. As far as
                    I know, it was completed. I think there were 12 volumes in all. It encompassed a
                    wide range from the Lewis and Clark diaries, and “The Virginian,” through the
                    expansion westward. Part of the appeal of the American Indian to the Chinese was
                    the chance to read about the freedom and spirit, particularly the Indian
                    philosophy of identification with nature. That made a lot of sense to those
                    steeped in the teachings of Taosim which has a similar point of view.</p>
                <p>Another series we did later on was on American law. In the U.S., there is a book
                    publishing company which specializes in notes for law students, “The Nutshell”
                    series. It is intended to provide a student in an American law school a quick
                    review of a particular subject like tort law, civil law, commercial law, or
                    human rights. In this series, there also were about a dozen volumes. We were
                    able to get this series published, and they sold out very quickly.</p>
                <p>One of the most popular books that we had in the program was a book by Len
                    Bernstein, “The Joy of Music.” That one the publisher couldn't keep in print.
                    There was another volume on American dance, which wouldn't sell here at all; it
                    vanished overnight in the bookstalls in China. Some of the stuff didn't move
                    fast, volumes on policy and other deeper subjects didn't move very quickly, but
                    other things they liked.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>I mentioned the People's Liberation Army Publishing House. I arranged a meeting
                    with a representative of the press. That was a difficult process, since you
                    could not call to an Army number directly. You had to go around a long route and
                    pass a verbal or written message to the person you wished to speak with and get
                    that person to call you. The telephone exchanges in Beijing are not
                    interconnected. I found out later that it isn't in North Korea either. The
                    military has a separate exchange, its own system. So if you want to talk to the
                    military, you essentially have to send a letter, because they can't call you.
                    They have to go to some place outside the military compound to call you. Anyway,
                    I made an arrangement with the publisher. I could not go to his military
                    compound for the meeting, so we arranged to meet for lunch at a hotel.</p>
                <p>At the lunch, there was a Senior Colonel, the equivalent of a brigadier general
                    in our parlance, myself, and a couple of his people. I told him that this was
                    post-Tiananmen, and I could understand his reluctance to continue with this
                    program. I offered that we might postpone it for a while. I would leave it up to
                    him. He said, “Not at all. We want more titles and I have some specific ideas.”
                    He wanted to do books on Eisenhower, on Marshall, and biographies of other
                    military leaders, obviously for training reasons. That was okay. The military is
                    an important audience for us in our efforts to communicate with possible future
                    Chinese leaders. They were willing to go along, so we continued. We did books
                    essentially on American military subjects. With the Peoples' Liberation Army
                    Press, we had plans to do several longer books on American naval history, but we
                    hadn't gotten started on that by the time I left.</p>
                <p>For most publishers, we tried to select books that appealed to a wide spectrum.
                    “Habits of the Heart,” for example, is a book on social issues. The most
                    important series that I worked on was the “Library of America.” In the US, I
                    don't see much of it advertised any more, but it is a basic collection of 40 or
                    50 volumes of American writing, most now in the public domain. It is the
                    collected works of Lincoln, Thoreau, Poe, Hawthorne, the big presences in
                    American culture. It is a very respected series, because they picked the best of
                    those writers and did very careful editing. I got the best publisher we had in
                    Beijing to gradually work through that series. These volumes are about
                    1,200-1,500 pages each. They are printed on non-acidic, very thin paper so that
                    it can fit on your bookshelf, but they are massive volumes of collected
                    writings. There were the collected works of Mark Twain, Faulkner, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>The publisher very much wanted to do the series with the same level of quality
                    and seriousness. So we made an arrangement with the Library of America in New
                    York, a non-profit organization devoted to encouraging an appreciation of the
                    best of American letters. That program worked. It is still in progress. They use
                    the Library of America logo and it is promoted as the Library of America.
                    Financially, it is probably a great loss to the publisher, except that they get
                    some foreign currency from the ones we buy and have their logo on a very
                    prestigious series. Nonetheless, the program, itself, is a deficit operation for
                    the publisher since each copy in the final version costs about $3, but while
                    that is less than 10% of the U.S. price, it still is too expensive for the usual
                    Chinese consumer. Yet the publisher wanted to do it because it was a prestige
                    item for them. This was the best of American work in a very scholarly format
                    that would present American thought and ideas, Thoreau, for example. Emerson was
                    in one of the volumes first published.</p>
                <p>A little side note on the volumes of the Lincoln papers that we had selected for
                    inclusion in the series. When I selected a list of titles for possible
                    translation, I would send it back to USIA which would then buy them and send
                    them out for a complete review prior to offering them to a publisher. I had
                    received a two volume set on the Lincoln writings which included his speeches
                    and letters, etc. I had them in the office and had already set up a time to
                    consult with a publisher when I received a call from the ambassador's office
                    saying, “We hear you have two volumes of Lincoln.” I said, “Yes.” “We need them
                    this afternoon.” “Why?” It turns out that the ambassador was going to see Jiang
                    Ze Min.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The head of state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. Jiang Ze Min is a Lincoln fan. He has great respect for his writings,
                    so the ambassador wanted to present him with the most distinguished set that he
                    could quickly lay his hands on. That was the set that I had planned to use with
                    the Chinese publisher that afternoon to begin the process of its translation
                    into Chinese. I had to give it up, and as far as I know, my two volumes of
                    Abraham Lincoln are sitting on Jiang Ze Min's bookshelf today. This underscores
                    again the importance of literature and books. Jiang Ze Min has a favorite habit
                    of quoting to visiting dignitaries small portions of the Gettysberg Address or
                    other utterances of American notables like Lincoln. It floors people who come to
                    see him. Lincoln has an incredible following in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the “Federalist Papers” rang any bells?
                        The reason I mention this, is in an interview I was doing yesterday. We
                        talked about how, when Helmut Schmidt was chancellor of Germany, he used to
                        quote the “Federalist Papers”in the Bundestag and most people would respond.
                        They had read it. You didn't have to say this was an American thing. He
                        would just say in the “Federalist Papers” number 3, etc. This was the guts
                        of American government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>YATES: Of course, Germany has a federalist system and maybe there is more direct
                    connection there. The Chinese don't have a federal system. I can't honestly tell
                    you that the Federalist Papers have a strong resonance in China. Certainly not
                    to that degree. But I think it is fair to say that the Chinese have a great
                    respect for the writings of our founding fathers, at least those they know.
                    Where we have a better shot with the Chinese is from people like Thoreau. The
                    idea of civil disobedience is, of course, a hot one in China, but a more
                    fundamental concept that is popular with the Chinese is Thoreau's thoughts about
                    man's relationship to nature. This is similar to the attraction to the
                    philosophy of the American Indian mentioned earlier. If you look at Chinese art,
                    that same relationship between man and nature has been exhibited for many
                    centuries. So the Chinese find resonance with this kind of thing more than the
                    overtly political thought that is represented by the Federalist Papers. Maybe
                    now with the new legal movement in China, there is a possibility that some very
                    important people will find that kind of connection with American thinking. So an
                    important part of the book program was to have this kind of intellectual spread.
                    Within the book program was art, a dose of literature, letters with a strong
                    smattering of American political philosophy (Lincoln, Jefferson and Hamilton),
                    etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that Edgar Alan Poe was included.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, that was a surprise to me. Certainly he is an important writer in
                    American literary history, but my feeling was there were more important writers
                    to include. It was a case of concession to the publisher. The publisher felt
                    that Poe would be a successful volume. He thought that he could sell Poe even at
                    a high price because of the high Chinese knowledge of that writer. Recall that
                    in Chinese history, our first point of contact was the missionaries who had a
                    penchant for forming schools. There are still a fair number of Chinese
                    intellectuals out there in the woods who were schooled in these American
                    missionary-run schools. What the missionaries taught were things that they knew
                    about, and that included a lot of American authors. So Faulkner, Hemingway, Poe,
                    all are authors that the Chinese have followed over the years. If they haven't
                    read them, at least they know about them.</p>
                <p>Mark Twain also has a big following there. The Tom Sawyer adventures, of course,
                    are well known. Other popular titles, things like Gone With the Wind are well
                    known to Chinese readers. When I was there, we weren't involved in titles like
                    that, but remember when the sequel to Gone With the Wind was published? It was
                    called Scarlet, and, I guess, it did not have a very good reputation in the
                    American market. I haven't read it and wouldn't have anything to do with it as
                    part of our translation programs. However, one of the publishers was deep into
                    it and translated the entire volume of Scarlet in a very short time. He had an
                    over-night best seller which sold out as soon as it hit the bookstores. The
                    second printing was also immediately sold out. It was a great commercial
                    success.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>Although we had no program interest in it, the Chinese reading public was eager
                    to get it even at the great price it commanded in the market. It also gave me
                    the clue that there was a willingness to part with money if the book were really
                    desired. The market, like most things in China, is vast and the publishers stand
                    to gain a lot of money if they have something that even a very small percentage
                    of the Chinese public finds of interest. So our primary publisher in Beijing
                    that handled the Library of America, for example, knew that once he got it, he
                    would still have it when the market matured. He was the man on the spot with an
                    approved translation which was co-sponsored by the American Embassy, as it were,
                    and would then be able to take the premier leadership, like Hollywood. The first
                    one out gets the worm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at strategy, when you were at the embassy during
                        this difficult time, 1998-92, when relations vis-a-vis the Chinese
                        mainlanders were in the deep freeze more or less, what was the strategy? Did
                        you sit down and figure out that this was what we should do during this
                        particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. The approach following Tiananmen in 1989 was largely keeping body and
                    soul together. The Chinese had systematically cut USIS out of much of the
                    discourse that was going on between the two countries and there was official
                    antagonism. That antagonism wasn't very deep, however, and it was possible to
                    penetrate this kind of official wall they had built around us. As I mentioned
                    before, they had put guards around all of our installations. They never
                    interfered with an American coming and going, unless he or she were a
                    Chinese-American, but they did interfere with our visitors and Chinese staff. So
                    our main business at that time was to hold the organization together and keep
                    the American morale up. Branch PAOs, who had access to many people before, could
                    no longer see them. Telephone calls were not returned. Attempts to visit schools
                    or make office calls were shunted aside. The Fulbright program was flat.
                    Candidates for the international visitor's program could not get approved.</p>
                <p>They have a system in China called the Waiban. He is sort of a gatekeeper for
                    foreign visitors and relationships with foreigners. The Waiban has to approve
                    any kind of contact. Beyond that, each individual work unit, or “danwei” as they
                    call it, has to discuss it with the individual and they have to have their work
                    unit approve it first before the contact is made. Then it has to go through the
                    Waiban and the appropriate ministry. You can imagine in a bureaucracy the size
                    of China's how difficult this was. The upshot was that we were not getting
                    anywhere. We had no Fulbright program, no exchange program, and people generally
                    would not come into our facilities. We had to start from zero again.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>We were lucky, because we had a large group of local employees who could get
                    access. We could get out of the office and where the Chinese had a particular
                    interest, like the publishing program, they were happy to continue the
                    relationship. Publishers, for example, gave very firm assurances that nothing
                    important would change. They would continue, but we must be discreet about how
                    we did business. They didn't want trouble, but they didn't want to kill the
                    golden goose either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you tell about being discreet, did you also feel that
                        we should be somewhat discreet because of public and media pressure in the
                        United States that we don't want to be too cozy with these Chinese because
                        of Tiananmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That may be a factor in the relations between the political, economic, and
                    other sections of the embassy, but our USIS business was not so influenced. Our
                    business is establishing ties. That doesn't mean coziness but enough contact to
                    get the word out. Our business is communication, not locking doors. So while we
                    assumed there would be some in Congress or parts of the U.S. who would be very
                    unhappy with our attempts to try to find ways to communicate with the Chinese, I
                    think most people would agree that this was an important thing to do. We had to
                    maintain ties with those who were our friends in China, those who were most
                    inclined to understand and possibly sympathize with our point of view. We had to
                    sustain that kind of contact discretely, always with the awareness that we could
                    not place any of these contacts in jeopardy with the authorities.</p>
                <p>More dangerous than our problem with Congress was their problem with their own
                    ideologues. So someone who was a professor and interested in American studies
                    would have to be very circumspect in his contact with us and we had to be
                    circumspect in our attempts to maintain contact. So that was an important
                    constraint on our ability to act. What we always had to keep in mind was not
                    only how much this would affect our political relationships at home, but, more
                    importantly, how our actions would affect that person's relationships with his
                    or her own leadership in Beijing or other parts of China. It was hard, because
                    for a time right after Tiananmen, there was virtually no contact. At work, we
                    kept the lights on and tried the best we could but, in fact, were rebuffed on
                    most occasions.</p>
                <p>When I first arrived in China, one of the first things I did, like any Foreign
                    Service Officer going abroad, was to make a round of “courtesy” calls. You go in
                    and say “Hi, I am so-and-so and am here to do such-and-such. Glad to meet you”
                    and then go home. With my books under my arms for presentations, I went around
                    to the branch posts and made these calls on as many Chinese officials as I could
                    cram into schedules of several days in each city. My visits also gave the Branch
                    Public Affairs Officers a reason to call their contacts and say that there was a
                    visiting fireman in town from Beijing and he would like to bring him around for
                    a “courtesy” call. This would give the BPAO a chance for a new or repeat contact
                    which he or she otherwise would not have. My presence was a commodity to be
                    marketed.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>One particular incident occurred was when I visited Shenyang and our branch
                    office there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shenyang is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It is in the north eastern part of China, up near North Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the old Daren?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: No, Daren is a port down on the coast. It is the old Mukden. It was a
                    Chinese rail head and became an industrial center during the Japanese occupation
                    of Manchuria. It is a dirty, tough town. It is an industrial city and pollution
                    is extremely high. There are Mexico City-levels of pollution there. I understand
                    that it hasn't changed much in the years since I left. I just spoke with someone
                    recently who had just came back and said it is as bad as ever. This was a person
                    who had bronchial troubles while there, the air was so bad. Just breathing was a
                    definite health hazard, particularly to our people who are there for a long
                    term. There is also a morale problem.</p>
                <p>I had to go up there relatively often, because the Branch Public Affairs Officer
                    is one of a small number of the official American community and the sole
                    representative of USIS. Shenyang has only a very small consulate and a connected
                    apartment building. Living is not terribly luxurious. One of the difficulties is
                    that food supplies are limited and you have to get a lot of what you need from
                    Beijing. Particularly before we arrived there, China was famous for its limited
                    supplies of food, especially in the winter when most fresh vegetables
                    disappeared. People in Beijing frequently ran out of things, let alone people
                    who lived in Shenyang. So, traditionally, it was a tough place to work.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>I made a visit there and saw the local provincial head of the Waiban, the person
                    with responsibility for all international contacts, including, of course,
                    Americans. The visit with him was typical of the visits that I had all around
                    the country. I remember this one because it was so graphic. I drove up with the
                    Branch PAO to the front of the provincial capital and went into his office which
                    was on the second floor. It was a nice office, large with upgraded furniture. He
                    was a fairly high ranking person. After greetings, we sat down and one of his
                    assistants was called in with a notepad and sat in the corner off to our side.
                    He began taking notes of our conversation. The provincial chief really laid me
                    out about the Voice of America which he termed was an affront to the Chinese
                    people. It had insulted the feelings of the Chinese people by aiding and
                    abetting the Tiananmen protesters. It was an incident that was an embarrassment
                    to everybody, etc. He went on and on and on. It was a very well rehearsed speech
                    that I had heard in other places. He went on with his diatribe on the Voice of
                    America, the inequities of the American government and how it has done such
                    terrible things in history, for six or seven minutes. It was quite a show.</p>
                <p>Then the note taker closed his pad and put his pencil down, and then we got down
                    to business. We then spoke about why I was there and he was very personable. He
                    asked me where I was from, what was my experience, how he would like to get to
                    know me, and other pleasantries common to such occasions. At that time, I
                    presented him with the books which he accepted with a big smile. It was quite a
                    stack of books. There were a number of books on the U.S. in Chinese and a boxed
                    set of three books on the US. They were paperbacks but collected in a nicely
                    framed box. We went through the pleasantries and promises of cooperation and
                    help. I noticed that the note taker wasn't taking any more notes. He was just
                    sitting there, listening and smiling and being very pleasant.</p>
                <p>After about 15 - 20 minutes of that, he cleared his throat, the note taker opened
                    his book, and I got another blast on the earlier subjects. I sat and listened.
                    It is hard when you are being roasted as if you were in court being charged with
                    heinous crimes. Anyway, the Branch PAO and I sat through another five minutes or
                    so of the diatribe while the note taker recorded every thought. When the Waiban
                    finally ran out of steam, that was the end of the meeting. We shook hands
                    amiably and were escorted out of the office and down the hall, with the BPAO and
                    me in the lead as customary. As we proceeded down the hall, I turned around to
                    say goodby as we approached the stairs and observed the note taker and my new
                    friend, the Waiban, had the gift books opened and were absorbed in animated
                    conversation with big smiles. Their attention was so intense that I had no
                    opportunity to offer preliminary goodbyes, so just turned and walked down the
                    stairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>To me, that was an illustration of what you have to be careful about in judging
                    Chinese rhetoric. If you listen too carefully to the argument, you get a
                    distorted view of what is going on. In this visit, the Waiban was really happy
                    that we came. He was overjoyed with the books because they are hard to get. He
                    was pleased with them and saw some value in them, because he carried them under
                    his arm. He followed me down to the car outside, the note taker had long before
                    stopped taking notes and was all smiles. With warm handshakes, we said goodby
                    beside the car. It was a very personable and valuable visit. However, if we had
                    argued with him or taken offense at what he said, we would have gotten nowhere,
                    and the visit would have been a disaster. I had learned that lesson the hard way
                    in previous conversations with Chinese officials. We now had his cooperation and
                    pledges of help in getting our visiting speakers into the city, placing our
                    Fulbrighters and speakers at the university, and making sure we had the right
                    contacts for the book program with publishers who would be able to take our
                    materials. All of these were things we wanted to get out of the visit.</p>
                <p>(Waiban or Waiban?)*</p>
                <p>We met our objectives by simply closing our ears and minds during the time of the
                    note taking. He had to record his speeches in those notes so that they could be
                    reported back to his own hierarchy in the political system. They said, “Look,
                    this is what I told those nefarious Americans.” He had the notes to demonstrate
                    his resolve and support for the strident policy and the note taker to confirm
                    what was said. Everything was fine. On the other hand, he also was able to do
                    his business and get what he really wanted. He wanted a Sister City relationship
                    between an American city and Shenyang. We promised and later made every effort
                    to locate a city willing for the tie up. Ultimately, we were not successful, but
                    the demonstrable effort was there. There is a glut of these formal relationships
                    and American cities are reluctant to step off into new ones. The Waiban's
                    motives were, of course, his desire for commercial connections with the US. For
                    that, he was very affable. Those notes, I am fairly confident, were not part of
                    the official record. If you gave them space to do what they had to do, you could
                    come up with very workable and very positive relationships with the Chinese,
                    even the seemingly intractable ones.</p>
                <p>Some of the more affable Chinese, the most warm, the ones who would put their arm
                    around you, were the ones to be most wary of. They often were the strongest
                    ideologues. A sort of reverse radish; white on the outside but very red on the
                    inside. They were often the very ones who had been trained as handlers of
                    foreigners, especially Americans. Naturally, not all enthusiastically friendly
                    Chinese were like that, but one had to choose friends carefully.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>Another vignette. On one occasion I visited “Diaoyutai,” the official residence
                    of the leadership in Beijing. It is located immediately to the west of the
                    Forbidden City. It is a beautiful compound. My wife and I were seated for most
                    of the dinner next to one of those Western handlers. As is the custom in many
                    Chinese official banquets, we were drinking mao-tai, a strong-flavored Chinese
                    drink that is highly alcoholic. It is not bad if you are eating heavy or greasy
                    Chinese food, but it can get to you pretty fast. The Chinese officials
                    attending, like most Chinese government workers, were not rich, so these
                    banquets for foreign dignitaries were wonderful times to eat a lot and absorb as
                    much as they can of the strong drink. This bureaucrat kept pouring down the
                    mao-tai, and it was fascinating to watch the metamorphosis, the butterfly turned
                    into caterpillar. As the evening wore on, he became stripped of his inhibitions
                    about talking about his beliefs and turned into a real communist very
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>This was one of the nicest, warmest, most affable and most understanding and
                    Western type Chinese we had ever had contact with in Beijing. But underneath a
                    lot of that was the other side of the Chinese, a real dyed-in-the-wool
                    ideologue. There was no point in arguing with him, because his opinions were
                    rooted as religious commitment to his interpretation of politics. You had to be
                    careful. Those who looked like ideologues often turned out not to be, and those
                    who didn't look like ideologues very often turned into the worse kind. You had
                    to be selective in what kind of relationships you had with people, because you
                    could set yourself up for things as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop at this point. I will put a few things here so
                        we will know where we start next time. We have talked about your arrival,
                        your book program, the problems in Shanghai, the fact that you had to deal
                        with a deep freeze situation, but you could get through to some people if
                        you were willing to listen to an ideological prelude before you got down to
                        business. A couple of things I would like to ask in the 1989-92 period. Were
                        you seeing any impact or monitoring what the Voice of America was doing? Was
                        it having any impact in China, good, bad, or indifferent? Also your
                        impression of American, but other correspondents, who were in China during
                        this time of immediate post-Tiananmen. Also about the ambassador and your
                        impression of the embassy. Do you have anything you would like to put
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It will probably emerge. We haven't talked much about Beijing and the
                    conditions while I was there. We haven't talked much about Chengdu, which was
                    another one of our branches or, for that matter, Shenyang. Each of them
                    presented a separate problem that confronted me there. Other things in Beijing
                    that deserve mention would be our attempts to make some breakthroughs in terms
                    of communicating with the Chinese, not face to face, but electronically. And
                    some of the telecommunication problems we had within the country itself.
                    Something about life style in the country, the diplomatic community at that
                    time. The main thing I think we should discuss is the state of the exchange
                    program, one of our major efforts in China, and secondarily the Fulbright
                    program.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is May 15, 1997. Ken, maybe we ought to start with
                        Beijing and life there, the diplomatic life style and what you observed
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: When I arrived in 1989, Beijing was a city under internal siege. Security
                    forces still held much of the city in strict control. Traffic was difficult
                    mainly because of bicycles. During the commuter hours, the city was a sea of
                    bicycles. There were separate channels on major roads for bicycles only, so
                    there would be an island in the road for the vehicular traffic and a rather wide
                    bicycle paths on both sides. That helped a lot in channeling them, but when the
                    two clashed at intersections, there were a lot of problems, and the bicycles
                    clogged up traffic quite a bit.</p>
                <p>It was a pretty quiet city, dusty and very badly polluted. At both ends were
                    large power generating facilities and much of the heavy industry was located to
                    the west. This meant that every time the breeze blew from the west, the
                    prevailing wind, it brought all the soot and pollutants right over the city. To
                    keep a house clean was a major problem, because with the windows open, there was
                    always dust and black soot drifting in. So Beijing at that time was not a very
                    healthy place.</p>
                <p>Food in Beijing, despite much ado about Chinese cooking, was not very good. You
                    could go out to restaurants to eat, but sanitary conditions were not the best.
                    The quality of the foodstuffs, themselves, was not very high. If you depended on
                    the local market for edibles, you were in trouble. There were private markets
                    where you could shop, but selection was not always extensive and who knew what
                    made the greens grow. If you knew enough about the city, could get around a
                    little bit, and had some Chinese, you could shop in those markets and do all
                    right. At least in the private markets, you could pick the goods out yourself
                    and take them home to cook. But that took a lot of time and is a lot of work. As
                    in most traditional Asian societies, the wife of a family starts early in the
                    morning to prepare the day's meals and works all day long on them. Unlike
                    dropping down to the Safeway here, you didn't go down the street and pick up a
                    few things on your way home from work for dinner. You had to really work at it
                    and prepare it in advance. You bought live, un-plucked chickens and things like
                    that. But even in the early '90s, things were getting better very quickly for
                    the Chinese, as well as for the expatriate community.</p>
                <p>Prior to the late '80s and before Deng Xiaoping instituted the reforms which led
                    to the opening up of the peasant market, just about all of the markets were
                    collectivized. All of the produce was handled by the government, and people in
                    Beijing were reduced to little more than cabbage and tea in the winter. There
                    was rice, but it was not always plentiful; cabbage always was.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>So that meant that things were better by the time we arrived. The meat was
                    better, but you had to be careful when you bought it on the open market. Many of
                    the foreign community would shop at what were called “Friendship Stores” which
                    were run by the Chinese government for hard currency. So if you had green
                    dollars, you could go in and buy international brands of things like frozen
                    meat, sodas, booze, and some goods like suitcases which came out of Hong Kong.
                    The standard of living was not terrible, but it certainly was Spartan.</p>
                <p>Yet, things were changing awfully fast. Major hotels in town were sprouting up
                    like weeds all over the place. They were international class hotels and they had
                    pretty good restaurants. They were outstanding when compared to the standard
                    (and for the most part very much cheaper) fare you had available downtown. There
                    were a number of famous restaurants in Beijing. For example, the Beijing Duck
                    restaurant, which I did not like. The duck was greasy and greasy duck in one
                    week was enough to last for a couple more weeks. As residents, we did not go
                    there very often. Those were “banquet” restaurants, aiming at formal dinners and
                    the tourist market. There were some Korean restaurants in town, a couple of
                    which we liked. Others were not very good and had to settle for the quality of
                    ingredients similar to that one could get on the open market. So it was kind of
                    a hit or miss situation on food.</p>
                <p>Entertainment was limited. Chinese television did not have anywhere near the
                    selection you have these days on American television. For news, you could listen
                    to the Voice of America which most people did in the mornings, or BBC or Radio
                    Australia. Chinese television programs tended to be pretty stale and not very
                    interesting. It was interesting to watch CCTV dramas occasionally to get a
                    glimpse of Chinese life, but as a standard diet, they soon paled.</p>
                <p>Travel was fascinating if you had the time and patience. The problem was, China
                    is an enormous country, the size of the U.S. end to end. Near Beijing, there
                    were the Western Hills on the outskirts and the Summer Palace and various
                    reasonably close sights such as the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs. Once you have
                    seen the Great Wall, however, there is no reason to go back there. There are a
                    lot of old wives' tales from travelers which were always fun to talk about. The
                    Great Wall is not a Great Wall after all. It is a lot of pieces of little walls
                    all over the northern part of China. That image of a single wall was hard to get
                    people to let go of.</p>
                <p>We had an incident, for example, of a well known woman runner from the U.S. who
                    came out to China to “run” the Great Wall from one end to the other. She was all
                    equipped with special gear and obviously had made a lot of preparations. We had
                    to gently but persuasively convince her that there was no such thing as “the”
                    Great Wall. She would not be able to start on one end and make it through to the
                    other in one long trot. Since they were scattered all over the area and many
                    were in various stages of disrepair and some were long gone, her mission was
                    truly impossible.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>There are common myths about the Great Wall. For example, it was said that the
                    Great Wall was the only man-made object the astronauts could see from the moon.
                    Despite that claim appearing in more than several official tourist brochures, it
                    is completely false. The wall is not very tall in many places. It is impressive,
                    but only about 4 stories tall. You couldn't see a four story building from the
                    moon, so you didn't have much of a chance to see the Great Wall either. You
                    can't see it from the moon, not even with good equipment. But, nevertheless, the
                    Chinese were very proud of saying that.</p>
                <p>Despite the misconceptions, China was a feast for a tourist. Many parts of China
                    were worth visiting. Shanghai, of course, was interesting just because of the
                    importance of the city in antiquity and as the most cosmopolitan of the mainland
                    urban areas. Chengdu, which is in the center of the country in Szechwan
                    province, was the old western capital of China and at the terminus of the silk
                    road; the eastern most point, it is a fascinating place with outstanding food.
                    It takes a very long weekend to get there, do something and get back to
                    Beijing.</p>
                <p>As time went on, things got steadily, and in some places rapidly, better. That
                    was true also for the multiplying hotel restaurants in the franchised
                    establishments often invested in by various Chinese official organizations,
                    including the military and the police. There was an Indian restaurant that
                    appeared at a Holiday Inn on the western side of Beijing and was a delightful
                    place to eat. It had pretty good control of the quality of the food which I
                    think was imported through the hotel.</p>
                <p>I drive an older BMW. When I took the car to China, I was told I was out of my
                    mind. Firstly, I would not get any parts, and secondly, it wouldn't run on the
                    available gasoline which, of course, was leaded. There were going to be all
                    kinds of problems. In reality, I had no problems. I discovered a semblance of a
                    dealership in Beijing which was in the process of becoming established and was
                    managed by an expatriate Yugoslav. By the same measure, all of these old tales I
                    tell you of life in Beijing are certainly now outmoded by far, because things
                    are changing so rapidly.</p>
                <p>As the hotels developed in their sophistication, they also started bringing in
                    foreign amenities like supermarkets. Beijing was growing in commercial
                    importance and therefore attracted a much larger number of international folk,
                    all of whom needed some sort of support like what they were accustomed to at
                    home. They also were willing to pay a premium for it. There was the Watson group
                    out of Hong Kong, which moved in to take advantage of the new and rapidly
                    growing market. You could go into their market in the arcade of one of the major
                    hotels and be surprised at what looked like a real supermarket, with rows and
                    rows of canned goods and frozen Australian beef. The meat was pretty dry, but
                    nonetheless, it was a great leap forward compared to what was available for the
                    expatriate community.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>Housing was lousy in Beijing but much better than it had been. Everything depends
                    on the development of the country. Previously, people who worked at the American
                    Embassy had to live in hotels. That was the first stage. Then the Chinese put
                    together an expatriate community not far from the American Embassy where many
                    people lived. But that was run down. The Chinese tended to build buildings that
                    looked and operated as if they were ten years old when they opened. This owed
                    much to the indifferent construction. Cement, I guess, was thin, elevators would
                    not work reliably, and painting was mainly whitewash and not the kind of durable
                    stuff that we are accustomed to. This meant every time someone walked down the
                    hall and bumped into the wall, there was a mark. It didn't take very long, given
                    the situation there, to turn a new building into a slum. It was a difficult
                    place to live in.</p>
                <p>We moved into a brand new apartment when we arrived, and we felt very fortunate.
                    When the embassy put the carpet in, it looked fine. The problem was, it had been
                    stored somewhere uncontrolled for a couple of years and was infested with brown
                    moths. Thousands of them. Every night, these things would come out and swarm on
                    the walls. When I took my problem to the General Services Office, they said it
                    couldn't be anything they had done and must be coming from outside. “How were
                    our screens?” Of course, there was nothing wrong with the screens; the problem
                    lay under the carpet. The padding underneath was infested. Ultimately, we had to
                    rip up the entire carpet and replace the padding, which is difficult after you
                    have moved into a wall-to-wall carpeted apartment. Even today, from some of our
                    goods that were packed in Beijing and not opened until we got back to
                    Washington, I swear I can recognize some of those brown moths emerging.</p>
                <p>Those were the living conditions we faced in Beijing. Every once in a while, the
                    elevators wouldn't run, and if you lived on the ninth floor as we did, you had a
                    major problem. It was okay if you were home when they stopped, but if you were
                    outside coming in, you were in trouble. Luckily, each building had two elevators
                    and if the one for your side of the building was out, you had to take the one on
                    the other side. When you got to your floor, you had to take a sort of catwalk on
                    the outside of the building across to your side of the building. That was
                    unnerving if you suffered from even mild vertigo and it was a windy day. We
                    would have to walk outside of the ninth floor level to get to our side of the
                    building.</p>
                <p>Also, in the part of town where we lived, the new Australian Embassy was being
                    built. In Beijing, with good reason, they kept all trucks off the streets during
                    the day. Trucks could only run at night. That meant that the noise on the
                    streets was highest in the evening when trucks were running back and forth
                    delivering gravel and cement. You had the beep-beep-beep noise that goes on when
                    trucks back up, and this went on all night from about 11:00 to 4:00 in the
                    morning. All this was accompanied by the intermittent crash of gravel being
                    dumped on the ground, so it didn't make for a very pleasant existence.</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>Another little quirk in the Chinese system usually occurred in June when they
                    would turn off the hot water. The philosophy was that you don't need hot water
                    because it was June. It was warm. This was probably true, but you want to take a
                    shower and cold showers are just about as cold in June as they are in December.
                    That meant no hot water for anything in the apartments. Some embassies rented
                    hotel rooms so people could take a towel, a bar of soap, and go down to the
                    hotel and use the shower at least a couple of times a week. So this was not
                    gracious living in the sense I am sure members of Congress would see life in the
                    Foreign Service. It was not easy in a whole variety of ways. For example, you
                    could not drink the water, which meant you had to drink bottled water. You could
                    either take what the embassy provided or use the tablets they gave you and make
                    your own. In the more remote parts of China where the embassy didn't have a
                    supply of bottled water, they had distillers. Each embassy apartment was
                    provided with one, so you could distill your own water. If you have ever had to
                    drink distilled water, you know it does not taste very good. Once you distill
                    the water, you have to aerate it and in aerating it, of course, you then
                    introduce the possibility of more of introducing those things that you were
                    distilling out. Anyway, it was not easy.</p>
                <p>We had a resident doctor in Beijing for the many ills and problems that were
                    likely to occur. A psychiatrist visited from time to time to try to soothe the
                    pressures from the day-to-day existence. Security remained a worry for many
                    people. The wife of the Public Affairs Officer was threatened with a knife in
                    the market one day. There were then, and I am sure there still are today, people
                    in China who don't like foreigners and essentially insist that you leave one way
                    or another. That made life nerve wracking, especially for wives who were not
                    working and who had to make other things interesting for themselves like
                    shopping or moving around the city. That was hard and sometimes dangerous. There
                    were a couple of knifings while we were there. Mostly teenagers who would get
                    into trouble. For children, there was not much to do, and this meant additional
                    pressures on families. We didn't have kids, so it wasn't much of a problem for
                    us, but those who had them found there were a lot of things they did not have
                    for their children that they wished they had.</p>
                <p>But life was still interesting, because you could move around China and learn
                    much. You could go to some place that was old and different. Because you could
                    exhaust the major sights in Beijing rather quickly, you probably did not go back
                    very often. How many times would you want to go through the Forbidden City, for
                    example? It is interesting, and every time you go there, you find something
                    different, but it pretty much stays the same. There were museums that would
                    change their exhibits now and then. But in many ways, it certainly was not a
                    world class exhibition city. So you found your interests where you could. People
                    who worked, of course, found it in the work, which was remarkably interesting
                    because of the constant challenges at that time. But for the diplomatic
                    community, it was like a ghetto. You lived with other diplomats from all over
                    the world.</p>

                <p>There was not an American ghetto or African ghetto, it was all mixed up. But that
                    meant you probably had people living next to you who had kids who didn't have
                    any money. That was particularly true for the diplomats from the smaller nations
                    in Africa or the third world countries that Beijing had cultivated for so many
                    years who had no salaries to speak of and had to innovate to get along. The
                    Chinese had simply given them space for embassies to maintain those relations.
                    So they were living check-by-jowl with people who were relatively rich and that
                    led to temptations. In one of the compounds, there was something that could
                    loosely be termed as gangs comprised of the youth of some third world countries.
                    I guess you could say that most of the danger from theft or burglary probably
                    was from other foreigners. If something happened, the Chinese police would say
                    it was a foreign problem and had nothing to do with them. We didn't get much
                    help.</p>
                <p>In the residential areas, the security was not pervasive. You had privacy, but
                    there was a strong probability that all the apartments were bugged. We were on
                    the ninth floor, the top inhabited floor. Above us was a very large area where
                    the heating pipes and elevator machinery was located in the center of the roof
                    and on the two sides was a flat area of roof. You could get up there, but there
                    were parts of that section that were locked up and there were Chinese employees,
                    rather intelligent looking people, running up and down the stairs there often,
                    so that was probably where the listening devices for the buildings were located,
                    in those locked rooms next to the elevator machinery. In the summer when it got
                    hot, they would open the doors and you could see people going and coming,
                    although some of them had air conditioners, which was very rare in China. I
                    guess if you are one of that kind of person, you tend to get what you want.</p>
                <p>I had an incident driving home one warm afternoon. As is my habit in warm
                    weather, I had my arm out the window and was driving beside the construction
                    site of the Australian Embassy. A bicyclist rode up beside me, grabbed a hold of
                    the car and threw something into the car and then rode off. He then stopped his
                    bike and turned around and looked back at me. I stopped, got out of the car and
                    chewed him out for endangering himself and my control of the car. Without a word
                    he turned, got on his bicycle and left. I found out later that what he had
                    tossed into the car was a folded up piece of paper saying, “I want to meet you.”
                    It gave a place and a time. He was fairly well dressed. Clearly not a student.
                    He looked to be in his early to middle twenties. He had a white shirt on and
                    looked like a bureaucrat. Of course, you never know what complex things you
                    encounter. Entrapment was a common danger. People are approached by all kinds of
                    things. I threw the paper away in the parking lot and then reported it to the
                    security people for a couple of reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>If I kept the paper, I was subject to being picked up for possibly aiding and
                    abetting somebody and, if this was a setup, putting myself in jeopardy by
                    walking around with that piece of paper in my pocket. If they found the piece of
                    paper, there was no incriminating evidence on it for anybody, so I didn't feel I
                    might be putting somebody in danger. I suspected that, given the nature of the
                    person and the place of the incident, it was a setup planned for some reason by
                    the security forces. All took place not far from one of the security huts that
                    surrounded the foreigners compound. The location was in full view of that post.
                    There were plenty of other places around town where somebody could have left the
                    paper without being in view of a security post. So to me he was either very
                    inept, and somebody I wouldn't want to have anything to do with anyway. Just why
                    he had stopped his bicycle after tossing in the note was a mystery. If he had
                    been a dissident, he should have kept going out of fear of being discovered by
                    the security person at the compound. Another question was why, after I had
                    stopped and yelled at the bicyclist, no security guard approach or inquired what
                    the problem was. Of course, if it was a setup by a security group they would
                    have stayed away, not wanting to interfere in that operation. Just why he
                    stopped I will never know. I never heard anything more about it from security.
                    Those are the kinds of things you were subjected to.</p>
                <p>In the back of our compound at USIS, we had the residence of the Ambassador and
                    the embassy's Health Unit. That compound once served as the entire liaison
                    office and so had several support buildings that were used to support the much
                    smaller staff of the time. It was in the health unit that Dr. Fang Li Zhi, the
                    very famous astrophysicist dissident was in “hiding.” Of course, the Chinese
                    knew exactly where he was and likely had the place zeroed in with all types of
                    detection devices. Every day I had to go to work in my office not more than 20
                    yards from where Dr. Fang and his wife resided. He had come to the residence
                    during the period of Tiananmen, and since diplomat compounds are legally the
                    territory of the resident embassy, the Chinese were not allowed to enter. If
                    they wished to, they could have walked in at any time, using only a small amount
                    of force; there is no real protection, only diplomatic convention.</p>
                <p>So we had super special Chinese surveillance around the compound. Across from the
                    sole gate to the compound sat a Mercedes Benz with four security personnel at
                    all times. They consisted of a driver, one female security agent, one apparent
                    supervisor, a male, and one who was obviously a simple muscle man. We also had a
                    Chinese security motorcyclist who always hung out with them. They would play
                    cards in the car with all the doors open. They were bored stiff. I actually felt
                    sorry for them. I would often drive my car into the compound on weekends to wash
                    it with the hose on the shady side of the building. Of course, it was close to
                    the building and not within easy sight of the security people monitoring the
                    building. I would drive in, possibly do some work in the office, and then. go
                    out and wash the car. On leaving the compound, I would be followed every time by
                    both the Mercedes and the motorcycle because they were suspicious that I might
                    be spiriting away Dr. Fang, his wife, or both. Of course, another Mercedes would
                    take the place of the one following me from the compound.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>I was followed no matter where I went, shopping, picking my wife up for lunch at
                    a hotel somewhere, etc. When we would get out of the car, lock it, and walk
                    away, one of the security people would approach it to check out the back seat
                    for anything suspicious. Often, one would stand on the rear bumper and jump up
                    and down to see whether or not something heavy was in the trunk. They were
                    always careful not to damage anything and never tried to break in, but they sure
                    made a mess of my rear bumper.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, I was very happy to have them escorting me, because in Beijing
                    traffic, you are always subject to getting into an accident from a bicyclist who
                    rides right in front of you without any chance for me to stop. If you hit the
                    person, possibly causing injury, maiming or death, the consequences can be very
                    difficult. Crowds gather quickly at any accident, and the foreigner is always
                    considered guilty. The courts always seem to find that guilt goes with the
                    ability to pay. People at the embassy had those kinds of incidents too
                    frequently during the time I was in Beijing. If you do, you have real trouble
                    that may lead to your being forced to leave the country or even physical injury
                    from the crowds that can easily be stirred up.</p>
                <p>Anyway, having the security car right on my tail meant I probably would have had
                    plenty of witnesses if I had gotten into any kind of problem. Because the
                    security car carried no license tags, it was easily spotted for what it was by
                    the normal Beijing citizen. No one would want to tangle with the security
                    division, so that alone might have dissuaded those curious that would otherwise
                    run to check out an accident. In a way, the following chase car was a strange
                    comfort.</p>
                <p>I was talking about the problem of security forces following me in Beijing. This
                    practice led to a variety of interesting circumstances. Traffic was always heavy
                    and crowded. If you pull up to a traffic light just as it was changing yellow,
                    the light would turn red before you could get completely through the
                    intersection. Usually the cross traffic would begin to jump the light as it
                    turned yellow, so a chase car, if it was several lengths behind would possibly
                    get caught by the cross traffic. This would mean the chase car driver would
                    either lose you or be forced to do something dangerous like forcing his way
                    through the light. Most of the time, they did just that. However, in certain
                    circumstances such as a blocking bus, the car would be caught. That would show
                    the function of the motorcycle, which would also be a part of the cavalcade. If
                    the car got caught in traffic, the motorcyclist could then take over and follow
                    the car until the Mercedes could catch up again. He would travel down sidewalks
                    to make sure you were not lost. The possible loss of Fang Li Zhi was that
                    serious an issue to them.</p>
                <p>After a while, you began to know these people, because they were the same people
                    all the time. If the light looked as if it was going to change, I made it a
                    habit to slow down to make sure I didn't get through the intersection in time.
                    After a while, the driver of the chase car began, I think, to understand what I
                    was doing. I never had any problems with chase cars. Knowing I would not cause
                    them trouble, they would not tailgate, and although they had to follow me, they
                    were always polite and never abused their authority. I never had any
                    difficulties.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Some others who got their kicks from losing the chase cars did have trouble. We
                    had one younger officer who had a pickup truck, one with a camper body on the
                    back. It was easily identified. He had good Chinese and traveled all over
                    Beijing. He knew some of the dissidents. Like the rest of us, he was routinely
                    followed by the security forces. Unfortunately, he saw it as a game. He would
                    cut down some hutong, which is an alley in Beijing, and make a quick turn down
                    another one. He knew his way around Beijing and sometimes could lose the
                    security car. He did so on several occasions which he thought was a terrific
                    experience and some kind of minor victory. Yet it was a pyrrhic one, for he
                    found one morning that all four tires were slashed flat. The Chinese security
                    forces came over and looked and said, “Gee, this is terrible. Must be one of
                    these foreign kids, a Chinese kid wouldn't do that.” That probably was true, a
                    Chinese kid didn't do it. I think it was a pretty obvious warning that if you
                    are going to fool with the security forces, you are not going to be driving. So
                    take your choice, either no tires or the security people. So I think he learned
                    his lesson at that point. This was their country, and if they wanted to do
                    something, they would. You buck them at your own peril.</p>
                <p>That is a little glimpse of life in Beijing. There wasn't much social life, of
                    course, although there were diplomatic parties all the time where people got
                    together for conversation, trading of stories, and something to drink. They were
                    not very elaborate, and Beijing was not a place where there was a very heavy
                    social world. If you wanted to go to parties, you could, because most embassies
                    would have national days. With all the countries represented in the Chinese
                    capital, there was almost always someone's national day you could go to. But it
                    was the same crowd all of the time and not very interesting. You got sore feet,
                    didn't get fed very well, and if you did not drink, it was not much fun. I did
                    not drink much, so I did not find much interesting unless there were contacts
                    you could meet there.</p>
                <p>If there were Chinese officials invited, it was worth going to receptions just to
                    make contact, because you couldn't go to their offices very often. One of the
                    problems of working in Beijing, particularly right after Tiananmen, was that all
                    Chinese contacts shut down. You couldn't get through to anybody. The most
                    frustrating thing was, you were supposed to be a Foreign Service Officer
                    contacting people of the country, and you couldn't do that unless you got
                    outside of Beijing. That is why my trips to the USIS branches were always so
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador and how did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>YATES: When I arrived, Jim Lilley was the ambassador. He had come in from Korea.
                    He was actually born in China and, I think, had a very strong personal
                    identification with the country. He was nice, smart, capable, and well liked in
                    the embassy. He was a little stiff sometimes but nevertheless a warm human
                    person. Yet despite his personality and early ties with China, he had a hard
                    time. More than any other person in the embassy, the ambassador is the one who
                    does the contacting or hobnobbing with officials. He could not get to see
                    anybody. Even the mayor of Beijing was not available to him for a long, long
                    time. In fact, the first breakthrough with Mayor Chen Chi Tong was something
                    that I became involved in.</p>
                <p>As Deputy Public Affairs Officer, I inherited many of the invitations that were
                    passed to the Public Affairs Officer but which he did not want to attend. The
                    embassy sent over an invitation it had received for a reception in connection
                    with the publishing of a book, an event that was not a very exciting opportunity
                    for most. The book was a Chinese encyclopedia commemorating the Olympics of
                    2000. This was the beginning of the Chinese campaign to be selected for the 2000
                    Olympics. It was essentially a travel book about China and Chinese things. Of
                    course no one wanted to go, so it was passed along to me, the book guy. I was
                    reluctant but decided to go, since we didn't get many invitations and somebody
                    should represent the United States.</p>
                <p>As expected, it was a very dry ceremony in a big room with a lot of people,
                    mostly Chinese. I was seated in the front middle, as befitting a representative
                    of the US, but I was a bit uncomfortable since it was expected to be an
                    unfortunately long ceremony with lots of speeches. On one side, I had a Yugoslav
                    representative who didn't speak any English and I spoke no Serbo-Croatian, so I
                    ignored her. On the other side of me was seated an older lady, whom I took to be
                    the mother of a writer or somebody like that. We struck up a simple conversation
                    in Chinese; she spoke no English. We talked about all the inane things you talk
                    about at a gathering like that. Isn't this nice and what the book was about,
                    etc. Out of the blue, she asked me at one point if I thought the ambassador
                    would like to meet the mayor? I was a bit taken aback. Strange things routinely
                    happened in China, but this was in a league of its own. I knew the ambassador
                    had long wished to pay a call on the mayor but had been rebuffed by the
                    hard-nosed Communist. Mayor Chen Chi Tong was implicated in the middle of events
                    that took place at Tiananmen, but as leader of the capital city was an
                    important, “must meet” for the ambassador.</p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>The ceremony was beginning, and people were making speeches, shouting into the
                    microphones, and walking around the room with flowers, making presentations. I
                    responded, “Why, of course. Why do you ask?” She replied, “Well, if you think
                    the ambassador would be interested in meeting the mayor (who was later removed
                    from office because of corruption), I think I can arrange it. Give me a call
                    when you get back to your office.” I said, “Fine, I will do that.” Then, for the
                    first time, she gave me her card. She was Beijing's Waiban. As I noted before,
                    the Waiban were responsible for handling foreign affairs within their
                    jurisdiction. Every major governmental area has a Waiban and she was the one for
                    Beijing. Evidently she was a Russian translator years ago, used by Mao Zedong in
                    his contacts with Soviets. Madame Gan was in her early-sixties when I met her,
                    and evidently had been given the post as a reward for her good service to the
                    late chairman.</p>
                <p>When I got back to USIS, I called the ambassador's office and asked what they
                    wished me to do. They asked me to follow up. So I called Madame Gan back and
                    asked what she had in mind. I was still a bit dubious since my Chinese never was
                    stellar, and there was small worry that I might have gotten the wrong
                    impression. I inquired about what exactly she had in mind. She simply asked,
                    “When would the ambassador be available?” I said, “Name your day.” He had never
                    even shaken the hand of the mayor of Beijing and would find a way to make time
                    at the mayor's convenience. Finally, we worked out to go to one of the older
                    world class hotels in Beijing for lunch. It was to be a small group, just the
                    mayor, the Ambassador, several aides, Madam Gan, and myself. It turned out to be
                    all very pleasant. We sat and talked about not much, but there was contact, and
                    that was the formal opening of contact with the city of Beijing.</p>
                <p>We always had a lot of administrative problems with the city and having direct
                    contact with the mayor would be very helpful. In China, “guanshi” or
                    “connections” made all the difference. Politically, the mayor was a very
                    important man in the party in Beijing, a senior elder in the communist party in
                    China, and somebody who the embassy should be in contact with. If we didn't like
                    him, we could still be in touch with him because he had power.</p>
                <p>The Chinese, themselves, did not have a very good mechanism to talk to us, never
                    mind us with them. It worked both ways. It took that kind of a low level contact
                    to get the ball rolling, but once it did, the Chinese were very forthcoming.
                    This was the kind of thing the ambassador was faced with as head of the American
                    mission. He had very limited contacts with the foreign ministry. When you went
                    into the foreign ministry as an embassy delegation, you always were led to the
                    same room, not someone's office. It was always the same reception room where you
                    sat in the same old chairs. You were served tea, they came in and presented
                    their position, and you presented your position. The meeting ended with their
                    thanks for your coming. “It was nice seeing you,” they would say as they helped
                    you out the door to your cars. It was a very formalized, not very productive
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>After Tiananmen in 1989, that was the way it was for a better part of a year.
                    However, it gradually changed. One of the interesting stories that came up, was
                    on how this change started. We always had steel helmeted, automatic weaponry
                    equipped, tall security guards stationed every 18 - 20 feet around the compound.
                    This was to intimidate us and to intimidate the people of Beijing from coming
                    through our gates to see us. Former President Nixon came to China on a goodwill
                    visit. This was long after his presidency; he was doing something for Pepsi
                    Cola. He came to China to see Deng Xiaoping, because Nixon opened American
                    relations with China and the Chinese never forgot. They see Nixon as something
                    of a demi-god. They didn't understand the business of Watergate, but they did
                    understand that Nixon was the first to make the breakthrough to China, opening
                    China up to the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>So Nixon came back to China. While in Beijing, Nixon was to come to the embassy
                    to meet with employees on the occasion of the July 4th celebration. As the
                    conversation with Deng Xiao Ping was later related, Nixon said, “I am going to
                    go to the American Embassy later this afternoon to say hello to all the people
                    who work there. I understand there are security guards all around the embassy
                    with automatic weapons and steel helmets. That looks awful. When I go there, I
                    don't want to see those guards.” Miraculously, no more than twenty minutes after
                    those words had tumbled out of his mouth, those guards disappeared and never
                    came back. At least not during the time I was there, and as far as I know, never
                    did. They just disappeared. In their place were apple cheeked, young farm boys,
                    obviously out of the far provinces such as Gansu. They obviously did not know
                    much about the big city. They had little side arms, sloppy uniforms and stood
                    around, embarrassed at having nothing to do. When Nixon came to the embassy that
                    afternoon, there were no steel helmeted, automatic-weapon-equipped guns around.
                    Evidently, Deng Xiaoping simply told the security forces to knock it off. That
                    was all it took.</p>
                <p>In addition to the motorized security forces at our USIS compound, the Chinese
                    also had every intersection in the diplomatic quarter equipped with television
                    cameras. Ostensibly, they were for traffic control, so that the traffic
                    engineers could keep control over where the traffic was and how things were
                    working, but, in fact, they were observation cameras pointed at us. So they kept
                    up their observations and the chase cars, but the threatening posture of the
                    security forces diminished greatly after the Nixon visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about a number of the posts. Shanghai, Canton
                        and Mukden. There were others weren't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>YATES: The former Mukden is now called Shenyang, the capital of the northeastern
                    part of China. Shenyang is a rail head and a major center for heavy industry in
                    China. Because of its role as a center of industrial activity, it is heavily
                    polluted. Also, because many of the heavy industries in China were the last on
                    the list for privatization, they are the ones closest to or actually in
                    bankruptcy. That leaves the economy of Shenyang a bit weak. Weaker still is the
                    remarkable city of Changchun just to the north of Shenyang. It is an
                    agricultural city, a poor city. It is one of the few places in eastern China
                    where you can see beggars on the street and people in rags. But the city is
                    magnificent. The boulevards are wide and all the major buildings that the
                    Japanese built are magnificent. They intended it to be a major capital. It is a
                    beautiful city, but, of course, it is no longer used for that. I had a chance to
                    visit once and shall never forget it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were our consulates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: In Shenyang, Chengdu, which is out in Szechwan province - the capital of
                    the west - Shanghai and Guangzhou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Chengdu where you were having some problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: We had a problem out there, because the facilities were no good. However,
                    Chengdu was extremely important as a major cultural and political center in
                    China. In terms of population, the Chengdu consular district included as many
                    people as the whole of the U.S. The consulate was on one floor and USIS was on
                    another floor of a major hotel in the center of the city, but visitors to either
                    had to enter through a separate entrance in the rear so that the Chinese could
                    control who was coming and going. Living quarters were on the third floor. That
                    meant you lived above the store, and it was known, at least, in one case that
                    there were Branch Public Affairs Officers there who hadn't been out of the
                    building in more than four months. There was a restaurant below and a shop where
                    you could buy cereal, fruit, and things like that. If you brought in a lot of
                    meat in a big freezer, and people did, and bought rice, you could go in and
                    close the door and stay there for months.</p>
                <p>Psychologically, it was a bad situation for people to live in. It was dirty and
                    dark, with electric power that would go out all the time. In these days of
                    computers and other electronic gadgets that are necessary for the modern office,
                    it was very, very difficult to maintain a reasonable operation in such a
                    situation. So, the Federal Buildings Office in Washington some years before had
                    contracted with the Chinese to build a new consulate on the edge of the city. In
                    fact, they did build the building, but FBO came back to look at it and said it
                    wasn't suitable. It was built to Chinese standards and had no real relevance to
                    our needs. Since they had not followed our requests, there was a big hassle.
                    This went on for years.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>At the time of the construction, FBO shipped in things like refrigerators, air
                    conditioners, freezers, furniture, and rugs and stored them all. Over a period
                    of about five years, these things began to rust. They hadn't been installed but
                    the building was still sitting there, so after long and difficult negotiations,
                    they got the Chinese to agree to rehab the brand new building and make it into a
                    building that would first meet our needs and secondly would meet our codes for
                    fire, power, plumbing, and other usual standards. In fact they did, but it took
                    us a long time to get in there. There was a great controversy among the staff,
                    because for USIS, operating downtown in the hotel was better. You could get to
                    places quickly to meet people, go to a coffee shop, etc. The new consulate was
                    way out of town. Although it was closer to one of the universities, it was a lot
                    further from the center of the city. So, there were good and bad things and that
                    was a major problem in Chengdu at the time.</p>
                <p>Chengdu also had another role. It was the gateway to Tibet. It doesn't look like
                    it on a map, but if you were to fly to Tibet, you had to stop in Chengdu first,
                    stay over night, and then get the plane to Lhasa, if you approached from inside
                    China. So that meant that people who were on their way to Tibet would have to go
                    through Chengdu and that meant that Chengdu provincial authorities had a good
                    deal to say about who went and who did not. If you didn't have permission to go,
                    you could not get on airplanes, get hotel reservations, or move. These things
                    all required clearances. For example, for citizens in China, you couldn't stray
                    more than five miles from the point where you were assigned without getting
                    permission. You had to apply for permission.</p>
                <p>There were certain cities in China that were considered open to diplomats and
                    tourists. The consulate cities were open, and you could travel there without
                    advance permission as long as you took public transport, mainly air. You
                    couldn't drive. They knew when you were going to go, because you told them by
                    buying a ticket. For other cities, you had to apply for separate permission and
                    justify your plans. They could choose to let you go or restrict your travel. It
                    was the same for their diplomats in the US. We had been able to add to the
                    number of open cities, apart from those with consulates, by negotiation. All
                    aspects of open cities and travel was by reciprocity. If we had a trip that was
                    turned down by the Chinese, then through the reciprocal arrangement, we would
                    turn down a trip the Chinese had requested in the US. Say they wanted to go to
                    Atlanta. We would say no, because the Chinese do not have a consulate there and
                    it may not have been on an otherwise open list. The State Department might grant
                    permission to travel as long as the Chinese would permit us a similar right in
                    China. So if you wanted to go to some place in China that was not an open city
                    and the Chinese said no, then we would deny one of their people here in
                    Washington permission to go to some place that was not an open city. An
                    interesting set of circumstances.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>I previously mentioned that I had visited Nanning, a city near the Vietnamese
                    border. That is not an open city. We were going to have a Fulbright conference
                    down there, and in order for me to go to Nanning, I had to apply for permission
                    and had to have it granted by the Chinese. Normally, they did grant such
                    requests, as we did for them here. They wanted to go to Huntsville, Alabama to
                    visit the rocket site there. We could let them go, but that meant we had to go
                    to some place like Nanning. The process was quite complicated. One consular
                    officer made quite a reputation by keeping very, very close tabs on that whole
                    process. Every time any slip occurred at all in China, reciprocal actions were
                    taken in the U.S. with the Chinese. It was a real game, making life a little
                    more difficult for everyone.</p>
                <p>Normal travel arrangements were also difficult. If you wanted to travel, you
                    could not simply go to the airline counter and say, “I would like to go to
                    Shenyang” and buy a ticket. All airlines of China were controlled by a single
                    ticket office so as to allow maximum security control. Also, because
                    communications were relatively primitive and because the separate Waiban offices
                    had control over foreigners outside of Beijing, you could not purchase round
                    trip-tickets. If you got a ticket to go to Shenyang, it was confirmed that you
                    had a reservation and a seat. To get back home, however, you had to make
                    arrangements for a ticket after you arrived in Shenyang. If there were no seats
                    for your desired flight, a common occurrence, the answer was “no.” You were
                    stuck. And many an American tourist was just that, stuck. Some found their way
                    back on trains which were frequently very long and uncomfortable trips. The
                    airlines were jammed-packed full all the time in China, because of the
                    development that was going on in the country. So it was an interesting
                    experience to travel in a country that presented so many difficulties. Are you
                    interested in more about travel in China?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't think so. I assume you were monitoring VOA.
                        What were you getting out of VOA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: There were two problems with VOA in China. First off was the skip problem
                    and getting into the locations intended. The second thing was jamming of the
                    Chinese language VOA broadcasts. They were not jamming English because English
                    was a resource to them as I described earlier. You couldn't receive the Chinese
                    language broadcasts in Beijing due to the jamming. If you went to a particular
                    western part of the city just before you got to the area called the Fragrant
                    Hills which was a range of low mountains that ringed the western part of the
                    city, there was a military compound with very large antennas. We were pretty
                    sure those were at least some of the antennas used for jamming. But the problem
                    with jamming is that it is a lot harder than broadcasting, because it doesn't
                    skip, it is a direct line. A well designed directional antenna will render it
                    useless or filter it out to permit an audible signal. The only way to render the
                    incoming signal inaudible is to make it powerful enough to overcome the incoming
                    signal from any direction.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>For reliability's sake, effective jamming transmitters must be located near the
                    city. All jamming is simply broadcasting on the same wavelength as the incoming
                    signal with another so strong it will obliterate an incoming signal, even for
                    directional antennas aimed at a signal coming from a relatively high angle of
                    attack as it rebounds from the ionosphere. But that takes a lot of oil and
                    energy. I noted before that shortwave broadcasting is an expensive business.
                    Jamming is more so even at a short range and in a limited area. There were about
                    eight known jammers around Beijing in order to make sure the city was not
                    exposed. Yet it becomes more expensive still. Since each frequency must be
                    jammed by all transmitters to be effective, a broadcaster need only simulcast on
                    several frequencies to penetrate a jammed area or at least significantly raise
                    the cost of the jamming.</p>
                <p>A radio wave can often be blocked by buildings, mountains, hills, etc., so an
                    incoming shortwave signal bouncing off the ionosphere would be coming down onto
                    the city from above, but the jammers would be broadcasting horizontally across
                    the city. If a person got behind a building where there was a radio “shadow” and
                    put up a simple antenna, he could hear the VOA Chinese signal that could not be
                    heard in other areas exposed to the jammer. So that meant the jammers had to be
                    arrayed in a ring around Beijing to make sure that signals were not getting
                    through certain sectors and to eliminate any “shadows.” Of course, you could get
                    yourself in a car or get on your donkey and ride out to the remote regions of
                    the city and hear VOA Chinese language broadcasts because the Chinese,
                    themselves, could not afford to jam everywhere all the time.</p>
                <p>It was clear that the VOA Chinese language broadcasting was getting through. We
                    knew that, because we would get postcards from people telling us they had heard
                    us on such-and-such and ask a question, enter a contest, or something like that.
                    We were getting mail from China clearly indicating that the Chinese language
                    broadcasts were getting through, but they certainly were a lot more difficult to
                    hear than the English broadcasts. Whenever I would travel, I would take a
                    shortwave radio with me, and in the hotel room or wherever I was staying, I
                    would try during the night to hear both English and Chinese VOA signals. We also
                    paid expatriates to do monitoring for us. That gave feedback to the engineers
                    about what frequencies, what times of day, and what the conditions were when
                    that person was listening. The problem was, many of our monitoring radios were
                    of a higher quality than the radios the Chinese, themselves, were using. So it
                    wasn't always a clear guarantee that we were getting through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we played a prominent part in the Tiananmen
                        incident and there were a lot of dissidents who were in the United States
                        during this time, students who felt they couldn't get back and there was a
                        lot of news about people being unhappy with China, were we having to pull
                        our punches at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>YATES: I don't think so, but there is a fine line between pulling a punch and
                    being careful how you do things not to damage your own interests. The finesse of
                    all that is determining what your own interests are. Obviously a paramount
                    interest we had was to prevent any kind of outbreak of war or conflict in Asia.
                    So you can't poke a stick constantly in somebody's eye and expect him to think
                    well of you. So we had to be a little bit careful about that. In somebody's
                    eyes, that would maybe mean we were pulling punches, because you don't always
                    call foul every time there is a transgression of human rights, for example.</p>
                <p>One of the problems we had in China was this question of human rights. It was
                    politically powerful back here in the U.S., and it was politically correct to
                    say the right things about human rights. Few would question the motivation of
                    defending human rights. They should be defended. Obviously, this is a basic
                    tenet in American philosophy, the American way of government, and what we are
                    putting forth abroad. On the other hand, if you want progress on human rights,
                    what is the best way to promote that effort in China? A good argument could be
                    made that the best way to get it would be to work to some degree with the
                    system, itself, to try to improve the conditions. Incrementalism, perhaps, is
                    the best word to use, and it is not always a positive phrase. You get two steps
                    forward, one step back in Chinese policy. I think we made a lot of progress on
                    that score. What it meant, however, was you didn't frontally assault them on the
                    question, because they would freeze up on you.</p>
                <p>China still has an authoritarian government. This is not a government of the
                    people, by the people, and for the people. We have to be careful, so that if we
                    want to make sure that human rights are expanding in China, we may have to take
                    a different set of steps rather than to defend every infraction of human rights
                    as we see them. The question is one of balance but always keeping the objective
                    in sight. Whenever there is a loss of human rights, someone is affected in a
                    very personal way. Can we afford to look away when the offense is committed,
                    even when it may mean that other, future transgressions might be avoided? What
                    are the basic limits on the question of human rights? If someone is held without
                    bail, is that a basic transgression of human rights? Not even in this country is
                    that a basic transgression. It is possible to hold someone without charges, when
                    releasing them might jeopardize others. There are strict limitations on that
                    police power, but it is not a simple, black or white situation. There must be
                    legal process.</p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>The Chinese don't necessarily always observe the law as we would see it. But,
                    again, it has never been so in China. China is not a democracy. They do not have
                    the same law. While there is a seed of democracy in their system, it has never
                    been a democracy. The question is how far must they compromise their own system
                    before we feel comfortable in accepting them for specific relations such as
                    trade. So it becomes a very complicated equation, and I don't think we had all
                    the answers while I was there. But I do think that we were careful. If we went
                    into a place where somebody gave you a hard time, you tended to listen and keep
                    your mouth shut until they were finished or wore themselves out talking and then
                    make your points, if you could. You had to use a certain amount of tact and a
                    certain amount of understanding of where the Chinese were coming from, a certain
                    amount of delicacy to avoid embarrassing the people who have the same goals as
                    you do, but not always the same road map to get there.. That's always a
                    difficult thing to measure.</p>
                <p>We had special problems with CODELs, because some of the congressional
                    delegations would come into town with one thought, to expose the human rights
                    violations in China. They would make speeches and do things that were not in our
                    larger national interest. I remember a very graphic example of that. Since I was
                    Deputy Public Affairs Officer in Beijing, I would be in charge whenever the
                    Public Affairs Officer was absent. During one of those interregnums, I got a big
                    CODEL in, with four members of Congress and a whole phalanx of others. The
                    delegation was led by Nancy Pelosi, the member of congress who was leading the
                    charge on the question of human rights in China and particularly on granting
                    most-favored-nation status to China. It was a hot potato in Congress then, and
                    to some extent still is. Despite an initial reluctance to grant them visas, the
                    moderates in the government had prevailed over the hard-liners, and the
                    delegation was granted visas. It was clear that some parts of the Chinese
                    bureaucracy did not want that particular delegation to enter, and there was a
                    lot of sensitivity about their presence in Beijing. However, the argument was
                    made that it would be best to allow them to see conditions directly, and they
                    were received with politeness and dignity.</p>
                <p>On the last day of their visit, they held a press conference at the USIS center
                    which I arranged for them. They came to the press conference after a
                    surprisingly uneventful visit and said that they had come to China, did not
                    agree with the Chinese, found many areas of disagreement, but at least were
                    talking. They continued that they had completed the trip, and everything was
                    reasonable. They had learned a lot and were returning to Washington. That was
                    all right. We finished the polite and unremarkable press conference, and I took
                    them out to the bus. We had a fairly large group of American and international
                    press, CNN, CBS, etc. On the way out, I asked Representative Pelosi and several
                    other members of the delegation if there was anything else that we could do for
                    them. The answer was, “No, we are very tired. We have been traveling a lot. We
                    are going to go back to the hotel and rest and maybe take a little bit of a
                    walk. Then we are going to get on the airplane and go home. Thank you very
                    much.” Everybody shook hands and boarded the bus. I turned on my heels and went
                    back into the building, satisfied that all had been done as required. The bus
                    drove off.</p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>About 20 minutes later I got a call from Mike Chinoy, the CNN correspondent,
                    saying, “I think you ought to know about something that is going on.” I said,
                    “What?” He said, “You know the delegation didn't go back to the hotel.” I said,
                    “Really? Where are they?” “Well, they are in Tiananmen Square, and they have
                    unfurled a banner protesting Chinese human rights. They were all wearing the
                    small white flowers which they had on before and in solidarity with the students
                    are making speeches and carrying on. There may be some trouble.” He was worried
                    about his own people, who had gotten out of the square, but he wasn't sure what
                    the repercussions might be. Security forces were moving in on the square at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>The whole thing, of course, became a blowup. That addresses the same question you
                    have been asking. This is what you call tactless. Here the Chinese had hosted
                    this group, and they were soiling the nest before they left, so to speak. I am
                    sure that looked great in San Francisco or in Georgia, or in Washington state
                    where they were from. One particular congressmen in the group was in a hard
                    fight in a gerrymandered district, and evidently needed the newspaper columns
                    which he was getting, but at what cost? In the aftermath of this, it was going
                    to become very difficult to get people in who really needed to know about what
                    was going on in China, because the Chinese would no longer accept them, out of
                    fear of the same sort of stunt. Those people in the Chinese bureaucracy who had
                    argued to let those people in to start with, now were under a cloud. Their
                    advice had turned out wrong. They had been bitten by the very people who they
                    were assisting in learning about China. Was the statement of support for human
                    rights worth the lost credibility of the embassy and that of the rest of the
                    U.S. diplomatic community had in Beijing? I would argue that it was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it didn't further any particular cause because it
                        only furthered the cause of the United States, you might say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: It only furthered the cause of several politicians from the United States.
                    I don't think it furthered the cause of the United States. In this case, the
                    cause of the United States was to see an improvement in human rights in China,
                    not to make speeches. This ran counter to that effort. What it did was to make
                    it more difficult to bring in the kinds of the people from the U.S. who would
                    make the case for human rights to the Chinese and give them a better
                    understanding of how congress was approaching the problem, what the American
                    people felt about the problem and why it was necessary for them to make changes
                    in the way that they treated their own people. Why this was good and why this
                    was healthy and would benefit them in the long run. That message was lost in the
                    political showmanship of the moment, and that is too bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Western, particularly the
                        American, reporting on China and the correspondent corps at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>YATES: Like every group of people, they varied. We had some very, very good
                    people out there who had spent long years in Asia, who knew China and spoke some
                    Chinese but had enormous difficulties in maneuvering around. Mike Chinoy is a
                    good example of that. He had been in town for a long time and could speak
                    Chinese and get around. However, at every turn they were watched and harassed.
                    We had VOA correspondents in Beijing, of course. The Voice of America was thrown
                    out of China for a long time, because the Chinese specifically blamed the VOA
                    for their turmoil in Tiananmen. If they didn't start it, at least they abetted
                    it as it progressed. So the Voice of America was under particular pressure in
                    China. That meant if they were going to cover any stories at all, they had to
                    press all the time for equal treatment with the rest of their colleagues. They
                    had to make a special effort all the time for contacts with China so that they
                    could develop their stories. One of the problems of the U.S. media, and those
                    from other foreign media as well, is that the people whom they spoke with were
                    subject to harassment, pressure, incarceration, or worse because of their
                    contact with the West. The Chinese did not appreciate their own citizens getting
                    in touch with media people, particularly Americans. Many of the media people in
                    China were not Americans; they were Brits, Australians, and others who came to
                    China and were working for American news organizations.</p>
                <p>One of the problems with correspondents in China was their editors back home
                    altering a story. The editors were interested in the sensational or striking,
                    but not as deeply interested in the why of what was going on. Hot facts were
                    always more of a story than careful analysis. That meant a lot of the deeper
                    coverage of China was lost. I think that is a disservice to the American reader,
                    but that perhaps reflects the interests of the reading public as much as it is
                    dependent on editors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the Fulbright and exchange programs had
                        been shut down after Tiananmen. Were there any changes in their status
                        during your time there, 1989-92?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: In the beginning, no. The Chinese were miffed. In their view, we had
                    unilaterally canceled the Fulbright program, and they said we had reneged on an
                    international agreement. Our position was that we had not and could not, since
                    we could not force American citizens to do anything they did not want to do.
                    When the so-called “incident” of Tiananmen occurred, many of them picked up and
                    went home because of personal decisions they had made. They felt the security in
                    China was not good enough for them. Some of the English teachers, those who were
                    so-called “foreign experts,” stayed, but all the Fulbrighters left.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>The problem was, how could we get things back on track. The Chinese felt that if
                    we could simply call off an international agreement at a whim or just because
                    people get discomfited, the agreement obviously wasn't worth anything. They
                    essentially stopped work on the Fulbright program for a couple of years. We
                    pushed very hard to get that program reestablished. Another part of that
                    difficulty was that Chinese Fulbright grantees who had gone to the U.S. rarely
                    returned. One of our basic interests in China was the teaching of American
                    studies in Chinese universities. We had a fairly good group of people teaching
                    American literature, culture, and economics in Chinese universities. Those were
                    naturally the ones who often would be selected as Fulbright grantees to come to
                    the U.S., because they spoke some English, were in the academic environment, and
                    had topics that needed direct experience and study in the U.S.</p>
                <p>We would go to a university, as I did in Shanghai, and sit with the university
                    dean to discuss the problem. At one point, he said, “Look. We love Fulbrighters.
                    We have always had Fulbrighters here and have a long history of foreign
                    teachers, but our people are not coming back.” In the Chinese system, when a
                    grantee left China, his position at the university would be kept open for his
                    return. The grantee may have intended to come back, but because of the turmoil
                    or other things, he didn't. That meant the American studies programs throughout
                    China were decimated. The trained instructors had all left. By their own rules,
                    the Chinese universities couldn't fill the positions until they either returned
                    or notified their universities that they would never come back. They could not
                    make such a notification, for that would mean that they would have to change
                    their visa status from student or visiting scholar to that of immigrant,
                    something that most could not or would not do. That meant there were all these
                    empty spaces, and there were no teachers to teach American studies.</p>
                <p>Younger American-studies scholars who were qualified and promising could not
                    accept Fulbright grants, because they could not get permission to travel until
                    their predecessors returned. The Chinese official interest in these programs
                    dried up. American studies programs were faltering badly throughout China
                    because of a lack of people to teach.</p>
                <p>We wanted to bring American Fulbrighters into China to do the same thing, to
                    teach American studies. But we couldn't get them in either, because the Chinese
                    said if they could not send Fulbrighters out, they were not going to allow any
                    more Fulbrighters in. They essentially laid their cards on the table, saying,
                    “Until you solve the problem of getting our people back, we are not going to
                    talk to you.” That was a pretty difficult situation. Another of my interregnum
                    duties when I was Acting Public Affairs Officer was to sit down with the
                    minister of education and try to work out a negotiated agreement, to get the
                    wheels moving again so we could start grantees moving back and forth. We
                    discussed an endless array of options.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>The one I had favored was where we would send Chinese Fulbrighters to the U.S.
                    for six months at a time, instead of a full year. One of the problems was, if
                    you send a Fulbrighter to the U.S. to study for a PhD, that ends up as at least
                    four years, an awful long time to be away from home. Therefore, we would allow
                    them to take their wives. In four years, a man and his wife will produce an
                    American citizen. Once they had a child or two, the equation changed. Besides,
                    American universities are warm hearted places, so that if an intensive,
                    personable, and talented researcher is working hard on a subject and gets a PhD,
                    he immediately wants to start post-doctoral research. In four years, they became
                    quite settled in the American university environment. They may have accumulated
                    lots of American friends, probably an apartment, a car, maybe even a green card,
                    depending on how they worked things out, and very often an American citizen in
                    the family.</p>
                <p>Now, they have a problem. He goes to his dean and says, “My child is getting
                    older and we want to give him or her opportunities and education. I like working
                    here, your people seem to like me, and I'm doing good work and would like to
                    stay on.” The wise faculty member will say, “Well, of course, we will do what we
                    can.” And they did. They would write their Congressman, the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service, make all kinds of appeals, and guarantee a supporting
                    income by giving the “temporary” Chinese Fulbright grantee a job. So now it is
                    six years and counting. Now the little American citizen is getting bigger and
                    close to school age. They are really interested in this because now they can get
                    a free American education for their children, but if they go back to China, what
                    is their situation? The child doesn't fit in. He or she speaks English. What do
                    they do with the kid? The humanitarians among us would say, “Of course, we
                    should make sure that the child can stay and build his future.” Many of them put
                    down deep roots, and it is not very likely they will ever go back. So where does
                    that leave the Fulbright program in China? No where, essentially. It was a very
                    hard sell. The Chinese felt there was nothing in it for them. We send their best
                    scholars to study in the U.S., and they do not go back. In return, they receive
                    a group of temporary scholars who come in for six or seven months and then
                    immediately go back to the US. That is a brain drain that a developing country
                    can ill afford. In addition, many of the U.S. scholars that enter China are not
                    always the best in their field. Sometimes, they could not adapt readily to the
                    life style on the Chinese campus, and most often could speak no Chinese.
                    Consequently, some of the Fulbrighters became glorified English teachers and
                    thereby became frustrated. Those that were acquainted with the Chinese culture
                    and language usually were China scholars, interested primarily in research, not
                    teaching. Even if they could teach, the Chinese do not need foreigners teaching
                    them their own history and culture.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>Of course, if you look at the personal side of things, many of the Chinese
                    Fulbrighters had a tough time making the choice to return. Faculty members in
                    China often do not have their own apartments and have to live at home with their
                    families of six or eight people in a two bedroom apartment. If they are lucky,
                    they have running water at the end of the hall. Their living standard would take
                    a tremendous nose dive by going back. They can live in a run down section of
                    town in Washington and be four times better off than they would be in Beijing.
                    So it becomes very, very hard to say to somebody like that, you must go home.
                    Consequently, what was suggested at the time and almost got adopted, was a
                    program by which university exchanges would occur, not in PhD programs but for
                    six month segments, without spouses or children, after which the grantee would
                    return to the sending school. Following another semester or two teaching in
                    China, the grantee would then have the option to return to the U.S. under the
                    same conditions for another six months to continue the program started earlier.
                    Another facet of the program would be that two schools would participate as
                    sister universities in the exchange. U.S. Fulbrighters would be the “sponsors”
                    of the Chinese Fulbrighter while they were in the US, and perhaps would become
                    return U.S. Fulbrighters to the other school on the Chinese side. These internal
                    linkages would militate against the earlier problems, since on each side, there
                    would be responsible to keep the door revolving.</p>
                <p>We eventually did work out something so that a limited number, I think the first
                    year it was 12 Fulbrighters, were exchanged, principally Americans going to
                    China. The reverse flow did not really get underway. One of the problems was in
                    China finding someone who was up to the business of going as a Fulbright grantee
                    to the US, language being among the principal problems. If they were going to be
                    an engineer, then it was easy, because the Chinese are whizzes at math, physics,
                    chemistry, etc. and any American university would kill to get a qualified,
                    highly competent Chinese mathematician, chemist, or physicist. They are great.
                    So that meant if they got them, they would never let them go. It doesn't take
                    very much research to find Chinese names in almost any of the disciplines such
                    as computers, math, etc. They are all over the U.S. and very widely respected.
                    Our argument was that eventually, they probably would go home, but a return
                    within the original expectation of four years probably would not be met. We
                    could understand that as part of the program and still argue that China would
                    eventually benefit much from the knowledge they acquired in the US. The Chinese
                    needed their skills immediately, as their own industry was growing rapidly and
                    they needed a strengthened base of qualified intellectuals. But despite the
                    problems, the program did get started again and as far as I know is prospering.
                    It is a good program.</p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>That raises one of the problems for Americans operating as diplomats in China.
                    You do not have much opportunity to go where people live or to see somebody at
                    home. While I was in China, only once did I have that opportunity in three years
                    of living in Beijing. That was the director of a publishing house that I was
                    dealing with on contracts. He was a university professor, a publisher, an
                    entrepreneur. He was in business. He invited me to come to his house, which I
                    did. This man was the president of his own company, a noted scholar, an author
                    of a dozen books, and had many business connections. He lived in a third floor
                    walk-up, a small dark apartment in Beijing. He had a television set and a small
                    rug. His wife and mother and kids were all around, and it was crowded. I never
                    found out if they had separate toilet facilities or not. Obviously, they were of
                    very limited means. If he had the same job here in the U.S., he could have been
                    living in McLean or some similar place with a fancy house, a lawn, and probably
                    two dogs.</p>
                <p>But in China, he had nothing. He was a smart man, a capable guy with a lot of
                    dreams and ideas about how to reform the publishing business in China,
                    particularly on the sales and marketing side. We had long conversations about
                    marketing techniques and how to move a product and promote it on the Chinese
                    market. He was an education to me. But again, his living standard was very, very
                    low. It is hard for Americans to understand the pressures on people in China and
                    how much commitment to their country it takes to stay at home. He could have
                    jumped ship. Although he wasn't rich, he was rich enough to be able to get
                    himself out of the country if he wished, but he stuck it out. Perhaps there is a
                    form of patriotism that we have lost in the U.S. with our open and free
                    government and comfortable style of living.</p>
                <p>You had to have respect people who either had such strong ties to their family or
                    their community or their nation, for that matter, to take the loss of what they
                    knew was better. Many of them have relatives in the U.S. and know what the
                    situation is here. You get mixed feelings after a while, living in a culture
                    like that and a lot of respect for the people who are there. So when human right
                    advocates come by and say, “Shut down trade with China, kill it. If they are not
                    going to do what we like, we are going to stop it,” who are they hurting? They
                    are not hurting the government, for it is going to survive, whatever we do. But
                    they are hurting those people who are trying so hard to make a living for
                    themselves and build their own technical competence to make something better of
                    life. I am not sure that heavy speeches on the floor of Congress are going to
                    help those people much. But some real support in terms of slow incremental work
                    probably will have a good effect in the long run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last subject. You mentioned that contacts were very
                        difficult and had been cut way back during the time you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>YATES: Yes, they were very hard. There was one technique that was important and
                    probably the only technique that was useful. Like the people of most nations,
                    the Chinese like to eat. Because food was not terribly good in quality or
                    quantity in Beijing during the time we were there, one of the best ways to get
                    people to come out to something was to invite them to dinner or any sort of
                    meal; lunch, dinner, snack, it did not make much difference. It was not really
                    possible to entertain Chinese at home, for they could not come to your home very
                    easily. It was too uncomfortable for them, because they would have to go through
                    security lines to get there. That would get them on lists to be watched and make
                    their lives and those of their immediate family suspect. Certain Chinese such as
                    many of those in the Foreign Ministry and those in international trade probably
                    had been cleared for such contact, because they had a more sophisticated
                    understanding of foreign living. But normal contacts, particularly among my
                    publisher friends, would not enjoy such easy relations. In any event, hotels
                    were available.</p>
                <p>A Chinese guest could be taken to a hotel restaurant fairly easily, since there
                    was almost no security in Chinese hotels and, particularly in the period
                    immediately following Tiananmen, Chinese citizens were allowed to enter the
                    hotels freely, because many of them could not depend on foreign tourists or
                    businessmen to support their existence. In that lean economic period, the
                    up-scale Chinese business kept many hotels afloat solely on their Chinese
                    restaurant patrons. People, therefore, could go and come at will. Sometimes,
                    there were security people around, but they were far, far less intrusive than
                    they would have been in a diplomatic compound. That meant my contacts, in many
                    cases publishers, would be delighted to go to lunch with me, especially if I was
                    going to pick up the tab at an expensive foreign hotel. Relatively speaking, a
                    lunch at a tourist hotel did not amount to a lot of money, but it made an
                    enormous difference to me in my ability to meet with some of these people in a
                    casual, yet businesslike, setting. Office visits were difficult, because if you
                    went to a Chinese office, that meant that person had to get clearance from his
                    Danwei, his work unit, to allow you to come in. You can't just walk into an
                    office in China. You have to go through a gateway where a person in uniform sits
                    and asks, “Who are you and what do you want?” “Well, I am so-and-so and I am
                    here to see such-and-such.” “Have you made arrangements?” If you have not been
                    cleared and approved beforehand, you are not getting in, even if the person
                    wants to see you. So it was very difficult. That gradually began to break down
                    as time went on. As I was more known to some of the publishing companies, I
                    think I could have walked in off the street, although I never did, because that
                    would put them in an awkward situation. The Chinese, of course, don't always
                    live in gracious surroundings and would be embarrassed if you walk in on them in
                    their shirt sleeves or even shirt off and in their underwear in the summer time,
                    sitting in front of a fan, because there was no air conditioning. This doesn't
                    lend itself to gracious living or gracious contacts. So you would go through all
                    the formalities in making arrangements.</p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>But feeding people was almost always good. The problem with feeding people was
                    the activity came under what the U.S. government calls representation, which has
                    very, very strong limitations on it. This is what is called by some members of
                    congress the “booze budget;” in other words, American diplomats are abroad
                    spending American taxpayers' money on booze, which was nowhere near the
                    situation. Nonetheless, Congress didn't like it. This meant we were very, very
                    circumscribed, unless we did it out of our own pocket. Beijing may not have been
                    a world class city for food, but it was a world class city for price, and that
                    meant that none of us could afford to go out and keep contacts using that
                    technique out of our own pocket. So it put a significant crimp in our ability to
                    operate.</p>
                <p>However, we did have some resources, which were carefully and wisely used.
                    Mostly, we took people to lunch, because the prices were cheaper. It was cheaper
                    to take some one to lunch than dinner, because they expect less and the hotels
                    were not as crowded either. This meant you could talk for a couple of hours over
                    lunch and really get into things pretty well. I did most of my work with
                    publishers at lunch. Toward the end, before I left in 1992, many of the
                    publishers were beginning to get enough cash flow to feel able to reciprocate.
                    Then we would go to some other restaurant, Chinese usually, where they had an
                    account or something. They were happy with that. It meant they could use their
                    official funds for food, and they always ate very well at these occasions.</p>

                    ambassadors. Stapleton Roy followed Jim Lilley, and while he was a very
                    different kind of Ambassador, he had the same sort of pressures on him. Where
                    Lilley was more intuitional, Stape Roy was more cerebral. I guess that is one
                    way to make a comparison. Lilley had instincts and still does, and most of the
                    time they were very good. I think he used those as his guideline as much as he
                    did intensive analysis. Stape Roy, I think, was more of an analytical person and
                    relied less on instinct. I think Roy was a little more distant from his people
                    than Jim Lilley, although they both were very much ambassadors, apart from the
                    rest of the crew.</p>
                <p>Like Lilley, Roy was born in China and spoke Chinese with a Szechwan accent which
                    caused amusement and wonder among the Chinese staff and the Chinese people he
                    would meet. His Chinese was so good that he would just blow them away. I think
                    the Chinese had a lot of respect for Roy, but I think he had the same problems
                    as Lilley in terms of making and maintaining contacts. I think Roy enjoyed a
                    better set of working contacts in the business community, because business by
                    then had prospered to the point where Americans were much more accepted in
                    China, and there was less fear on the Chinese side of somehow being coopted by
                    contact with the Americans. We had not reached full confidence in that regard,
                    and we still have not. I think it still is a long way off.</p>
                <p>One aspect of the Chinese which is important in the context of East Asian
                    relations is cultural. By comparison, Japanese and Americans have difficulty
                    getting along at times, because Japan is an island and always has been an island
                    with a distinct culture and cultural variances from Americans that makes contact
                    difficult. The distance they maintain from people in social discourse, for
                    example, is very different from the continental Asians, including Koreans and
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>The Chinese language, because of its patterns and sounds, also makes their
                    accented English more comprehensible to an American. If you had a Japanese
                    speaking English and a Chinese speaking English with equivalent abilities, the
                    Chinese would probably be more easily understood by an English speaking person.
                    On the cultural level, the Chinese have a better sense of “give and take” that
                    is more characteristic of a continental society. China is more cosmopolitan than
                    Japan in terms of multi-nationalities, so you get a different set of vibrations
                    there. The potential for improvement in relations with China is enormous. We
                    have a big hangup, of course, on both sides in terms of politics. However, on
                    the basis of person-to-person relationships, the Chinese have an advantage that
                    leads to an opportunity for improvement that other Asian groups may have greater
                    difficulty with.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Next time we will pick it up in 1992 when you
                        went to Hawaii.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 19, 1997. You were the information advisor to
                        CINCPAC, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I was the USIA advisor to CINCPAC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: From 1992-95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: That position, like many other non-mainstream positions in USIA, had been
                    cut by decision of the Area Director for East Asia, as he felt that he wanted to
                    keep more of the available resources in the field. The advisor's position in
                    Hawaii was considered a “domestic” position, of course. Such domestic jobs stuck
                    up like sore thumbs when people were pressed by downsizing and wanted to keep as
                    much manpower in the field as possible. Yet there were countervailing arguments.
                    The advisor's job in Hawaii was essentially to keep the U.S. command in the
                    Pacific tuned to the special needs of its overseas presence.</p>
                <p>The military, itself, was going through a downsizing process, and still is. At
                    that time, they were cutting back on everything except what they called “war
                    fighting capacity.” In other words, if you drove a ship or a plane, that was
                    fine. But if you were in uniform and were doing things like thinking about
                    cultural ramifications and popular opinion ramifications of our military
                    presence abroad, you were not considered as essential as those who actually had
                    fingers on triggers. This is probably a reasonable distinction. If you have to
                    give up on one or the other, the “war-fighting” capacity will have to take
                    priority. The military role is to defend the U.S. and its people and the
                    question is relative, I guess. In any event, that meant that the U.S. military
                    in its presence abroad was not being served very well, because the lack of
                    cultural and political sensitivity to the special conditions of operating
                    overseas in the Pacific region cost a lot of efficiency.</p>
                <p>If you are a commander from a base in the middle part of the continental U.S. and
                    suddenly are transferred to the Pacific, how do you operate in Guam or Okinawa
                    or some other place in Asia where your presence isn't welcomed or at least you
                    are not considered an essential part of the local culture. You are a guest. The
                    only office that really existed within CINCPAC to put that in context in a
                    cultural way was the USIA advisor's office. When I came available and was
                    looking around for my next assignment, I was asked if I would go and fill in for
                    about a year, because they really didn't have an onward assignment for me at
                    that time. This was an alternative to returning to Washington without an ongoing
                    assignment, so I went to Hawaii.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>People would say, “Gee, Hawaii. Aren't you lucky!” There wasn't as much luck in
                    that as it might seem. Hawaii is a magnificent place. It is beautiful, the
                    weather is gorgeous, and everything was terrific when certain kinds of
                    conditions all come together. If you are a tourist with a lot of money and can
                    travel around the islands and laze on the beach, it is magnificent and probably
                    unparalleled in the world. But if you have to live therem, you get a different
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>For one thing, Hawaii is very isolated. Many in the military had this same
                    problem. It is a “rock” two thousand miles away from the nearest significant
                    land mass. In Hawaii, people had all the advantages of the American system of
                    goods and material things, but they were very, very much more expensive. When we
                    arrived there, a box of Wheaties was seven dollars or something along those
                    lines. It soon became very clear to us that Hawaii was going to be a very
                    expensive place to live.</p>
                <p>Rents are astronomical. During the time of the Japanese “bubble economy,” when
                    the Japanese had lots of money to invest everywhere, including Rockefeller
                    Center, they bought up much of Hawaii, especially golf courses and real estate.
                    The stories were legend of Japanese businessmen coming to Hawaii with a pocket
                    full of cash and saying, “How much is that?” “Oh, about a million and a half.”
                    He would reach into his pocket and peal off a million and a half dollars and
                    then ask, “What else do you have to sell?” There were no arguments, no
                    negotiating. They were famous for paying whatever was asked. The immediate
                    effect of that was skyrocketing housing costs.</p>
                <p>That is okay, I guess, if the Japanese could afford it, but for Americans living
                    there, Hawaii became a very, very expensive place to move to. Those who had
                    owned houses for a long time and continued to own were not directly affected so
                    much, I guess. If you were going to continue to live in Hawaii and sold your
                    older house at a great profit, you had to turn around and buy something equally
                    expensive. On the other hand, many people cashed in and sold at high prices
                    before running off to the mainland where real estate was cheaper.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>The weather was magnificent when it was nice. When the “trade winds” are up and
                    the sun is shining, it is grand. When the trade winds drop, the weather
                    immediately turns hot and sticky and you can recall that it is in the South
                    Pacific. Because of its location, Hawaii is vulnerable to typhoons. Traffic is
                    terrible. Hawaii is one of the most congested places in the world in terms of
                    traffic. And of course, there are an awful lot of tourists adding to the
                    congestion. So that was a problem. Nonetheless, the work at USCINCPAC was
                    fascinating for a Foreign Service Officer. It was somewhat like living at a
                    foreign post. The military had their own language, own social set, own
                    conventions. When I walked into the job, I was confronted by an older man who
                    was head of the CINCPAC Public Relations Section. He also handled Congressional
                    Relations, and rather well I was told. He had the office across from me on what
                    was called the “Bridge,” which was the center of command for the Pacific area.
                    On that floor, they had the admiral of CINC (Commander in Chief) of CINCPAC; the
                    Deputy Commander of Pacific U.S. forces (DCINC); Jim Wilkinson, the Political
                    Advisor (POLAD), who had ambassadorial rank, (who as far as I know, retired in
                    Hawaii); and the older, rather crusty gentleman who was congressional liaison as
                    well as the public affairs guru. By virtue of my position, I was automatically
                    at loggerheads with him, because while he was very knowledgeable about Congress,
                    he didn't know very much about foreign affairs. There were no other command
                    parts on the “Bridge;” that was it.</p>
                <p>The command structure conformed to the usual military relationships, but both the
                    POLAD and I as USIA advisor were add-ons. Because both the POLAD and I were
                    outside of the other parts of the chain of command, it was possible to include
                    us on the “Bridge” since there was office space there and it would not otherwise
                    show favoritism among the other components, which fell under five basic
                    categories, each represented by a number following the letter “J.” J means
                    “joint” since CINCPAC was a joint headquarters. The numbers stood for the usual
                    categories in the military J-1 for administration, J-2 for intelligence, J-3 for
                    operations, J-4 for legal, and J-5 for policy and plans. For the most part, I
                    worked with the J-5 people who handled all of the command relationships and had
                    the greatest need to understand foreign relationships. The J-5 section included
                    all the area offices. Although the U.S. military had begun heavy cuts in
                    personnel, J-5 still had a lot of area offices: the Japan desk, the Philippines
                    desk, the Russian desk, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>The Pacific Command (PACOM) was the largest U.S. military geographic command in
                    the world. It ran from the west coast of California all the way to the island of
                    Madagascar. That includes the Indian Ocean as well. It was a key player in the
                    Middle East, because it provided ships, materiel, and aircraft to other commands
                    during the Gulf War and any other insurgency that came about. Such assignments
                    always involved the Pacific command, because it comprised such a large part of
                    U.S. forces. There were about 100,000 in the Pacific command then on duty in the
                    Pacific, of which about 30,000 were in Japan and another 37,000 in the Republic
                    of Korea. That is an awful lot of Americans overseas. Many of these soldiers and
                    sailors were on ships floating around the Pacific or Indian Oceans or in
                    submarines. All were under the general command of PACOM, although there were
                    some “dual hats” in Korea, where the same forces comprised a large part of the
                    UN Command and both the U.S. Forces/Japan and the U.S. Forces/Korea had much
                    autonomous authority.</p>
                <p>Such “dual hatted” arrangements led to difficult relationships at times. Whoever
                    was U.S. commander in Korea felt rather independent of the Pacific Command, and
                    this arrangement could make smooth relationships a problem. For me, this meant
                    some trouble in obtaining cooperation when that was important in program
                    planning or developing a cohesive approach to a given problem.</p>
                <p>My function at USCINCPAC was essentially writing advisories for the CINC and
                    participating in meetings to monitor what was going on in terms of public
                    relations with allies and other countries in the “area of responsibility.” Other
                    facets of my work were developing an annual briefing program for Pacific
                    military leaders, consulting on the preparation of the command's magazine,
                    “Asia-Pacific Defense Forum,” and sometimes participating in war games, a kind
                    of think-tank exercise where members of the command and invited experts sit
                    around a table and think deep thoughts about options in certain situations. The
                    war games, at times, considered questions which were a bit far afield for a
                    Foreign Service Officer who normally confronts only the real and present
                    situation abroad. For example, “If Japan or China or another country becomes the
                    enemy, what does the U.S. do and how does the military act to preserve U.S.
                    interests?” Other times, the questions were more specific, such as a
                    consideration of possible nuclear incidents. It was an interesting thing for
                    someone like me to come out from the environment of the Foreign Service and walk
                    into this very different military system. It took a while to become
                    adjusted.</p>
                <p>My advisories sometimes brought me into a bureaucratic struggle with the Public
                    Affairs chief across the Bridge hall. He insisted that all of my memoranda to
                    the Admiral be cleared by him before going to the CINC. While this might seem to
                    be common sense, it proved to be a real roadblock. Certainly, he should be
                    informed of my advisories on foreign public relations, but my feeling was that I
                    was assigned to CINCPAC and not to his public affairs office. So I proceeded to
                    direct my advisories straight to the CINC with info copies to him. That led to a
                    number of occasions when he fired up strong dissents to my recommendations.
                    While our relations were civil, he clearly was uncomfortable with my active role
                    in providing advice to the command.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>He finally retired, forcibly it turned out, since I was not the only one with a
                    functional problem in dealing with such a strong personality. Nonetheless, the
                    constant sniping on matters he had little knowledge of was debilitating to the
                    orderly progress of discussion within the command on matters that were important
                    to its function. Jim Wilkenson, the POLAD, was a strong supporter and had had
                    working experience with USIA. He was a great booster in this internal struggle
                    to provide the CINC with as candid and comprehensive advice as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I do not remember much of the detail. Jim was a Thai linguist, and I
                    recall that he had a tour as a Branch Public Affairs Officer in Cheng Mai in
                    Thailand, but I am not certain. It is the case that he did have a tour with
                    USIA, so he had a much broader appreciation of what we did than others in State
                    might have. He was a real down-to-earth person who had a strong background in
                    Asia. Q: I just wondered if he was a Far Eastern hand.</p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, Thailand was his forte. He also spent time in Australia and other
                    parts of the Pacific area. I had not known him before, because he was a
                    Southeast Asian hand and I was a Northeast Asian hand. He ended up on the big
                    island of Hawaii in retirement, teaching at the University of Hawaii's branch in
                    Hilo. Anyway, he was a strong supporter and an important ally, because he had
                    frequent and direct contact with the CINC.The commander-in-chief, at the time,
                    was Chuck Larson, who had four stars and had risen through the ranks rapidly. He
                    was a rather young four star admiral. He had been Commandant of the U.S. Naval
                    Academy at Annapolis ten years before that and then gone to other commands and
                    became the Commander of the Pacific fleet at one point. Then when there was a
                    change at the top, he was moved literally “up the hill.”</p>
                <p>Camp H.M. Smith was actually the headquarters of the Marines of the Pacific and
                    CINCPAC was a tenant up there on the top of the hill in a cooler part of Hawaii.
                    That hill overlooked the U.S. Navy's headquarters at Pearl Harbor and had a
                    beautiful view of Honolulu. Also below was Hickam Air Force Base. So both the
                    Air Force and the Navy were in direct line of sight from the command
                    headquarters on the hill. Of course, U.S. Army Pacific had its headquarters not
                    far from Camp Smith. About 20 percent of the island of Oahu is covered by U.S.
                    military installations. It is a big chunk of the island, a fact that is a steady
                    source of controversy.</p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>The interpretation of the role of the Commander in Chief varies a lot, depending
                    on the personality of who is in the seat, but certainly whoever is there, the
                    job involves a great deal of travel. The admiral can be expected to be out of
                    the office as much as he is in. That usually meant that the POLAD went along
                    with him. I did not. However, I was involved. Each time one of these trips would
                    come up, I had the task of putting together an advisory on the stops where he
                    would be, keeping the total text to one page in the fashion of all briefing
                    memos to the CINC. Of course, that was not always easy. For example, when he
                    visited Okinawa, I would come up with a piece on the situation in Okinawa and
                    some of the public affairs aspects that might emerge during his presence
                    there.</p>
                <p>The other thing I tried to do, was to set up media contact for him in the
                    countries he visited through our USIS Posts. This was to give the local media a
                    chance to interview him or at least get to know him. Every CINC has a different
                    personality; some enjoy contact with the press, and others do not. Admiral
                    Larson was in the middle. He knew it was important and enjoyed it if he were in
                    full control, but he was an old submariner and that meant everything had to be
                    screwed down real tight with no leaks before you dove. He insisted that things
                    always had to be locked down before any initiative was taken, and that is very
                    hard to do in an international environment. For instance, you cannot guarantee
                    that all 15 invited media members will show up for a press conference. If you
                    had a bad situation and only a couple or no media showed up, the Admiral would
                    be very unhappy that he was wasting time that could have been devoted to
                    something more productive. He was right, of course. But while he was seeing
                    presidents and commanders-in-chief, his counterparts in other countries, he
                    sometimes had less then full patience with scruffy journalists, who were more
                    independent than he was. So that could be difficult.</p>
                <p>However, when we had a happy event - when the two got together - Admiral Larson
                    was a master of public relations. He looked like what most people would think of
                    when they imagined an admiral; he walked and talked like an admiral and sounded
                    like an admiral. If you were a casting director for a movie and wished to have
                    someone to portray the perfect admiral, Admiral Larson would fit perfectly.
                    Everything was just right, the epitome of the best you could think of in a
                    military sense, a public relations dream. Always impeccably dressed with his
                    Hawaii tan. He paid careful attention to his regimen of exercise, so he was in
                    very fine physical shape. Plus he had a very quick mind. He still does, for
                    after he completed his tour as CINC and retired, he was called back into service
                    to return to the Naval Academy in Annapolis to pull it out of the scandal it had
                    stumbled into.</p>
                <p>He was a joy to work with, but he was sometimes difficult to reach because he was
                    so busy traveling and handling the politics of the command. He did not always
                    have much patience with public affairs, because of the sloppiness of those of
                    the press who must be dealt with. However, he clearly understood the importance
                    that public relations had, particularly in foreign nations where an antagonistic
                    public could create very difficult problems to the smooth operations of military
                    and security plans.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>One of the most important programs that I operated in Hawaii was an annual event
                    called the Symposium on East Asia Security, “SEAS.” Through our embassies
                    abroad, that program invited senior military commanders and officials from just
                    about all the nations around the Pacific area in the PACOM area of
                    responsibility, from the east coast of California all the way through to
                    Madagascar, about 34 nations. Not all of those nations had a military, however,
                    but even a small country like Fiji had an army. We would bring these officers,
                    government officials, and a few academics together in Honolulu for about a week
                    of discussion, examples, lecturing, and touring to see the presence of the U.S.
                    military in the Pacific, what its shape was, what the components were, and to
                    hear from the commanders themselves, including Admiral Larson, what exactly we
                    were up to in the Pacific. No press was allowed. We allowed no uniforms, so
                    everybody took his uniform off when they came through the door. The level was
                    generally O-6 and above, O-6 being a colonel. We had some very, very high
                    ranking people in that symposium that usually included about 20 to 25
                    participants.</p>
                <p>After a week in Hawaii of getting the American situation, we would take off to
                    Japan where the Japanese would explain why the Americans are there, the purpose
                    of the Japan-US security treaty, and how the Japanese view the East Asian
                    security situation. That, of course, left them open to some very hot questions
                    from people who were very suspicious of Japanese motives and capacities. The
                    Japanese responses and the relationship with the Americans were usually an
                    eye-opener for most of the Southeast Asians who were on the tour.</p>
                <p>Then we would move to Korea where we would get the Korean point of view of the
                    security situation in Northeast Asia, something most Southeast Asians had very
                    little comprehension about, although many had read about the context of problems
                    in the region. During that part of the symposium, we would go to the Osan Air
                    Base to get a look at how Korean and American air forces worked together. How
                    they operated together, what they did, where they ate, and how they fraternized.
                    Then we went up to the DMZ (demilitarized zone) to take a look at the security
                    situation on the line and get a briefing from the Koreans up there. We met with
                    a Korean think-tank and tossed about the whole question of unification of the
                    two parts of the Korean peninsula to get a political feel for the security
                    situation in that key Northeast Asian country in its confrontation with the
                    North.</p>
                <p>From there, we would go to Singapore. In Singapore, we would do the reverse of
                    what we did in northeast Asia and get the southeast Asian point of view on
                    security issues. This was something the Japanese were always unsettled about,
                    because they suddenly discovered that World War II was not as far in their past
                    as they thought it had become. We broke the seminar up in Singapore. All of this
                    took about three weeks. It was a fairly long period of time for senior people to
                    be away from their commands and responsibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>Hawaii was also interesting, because we included as part of the SEAS program a
                    visit to the East-West Center. That is an academic institution that exists to
                    consider problems of the Pacific, particularly the South Pacific. Along with the
                    North-South Center in Florida, it was congressionally funded and had a sometimes
                    diffuse mandate to consider all aspects of the Pacific milieu. Security
                    questions, however, were always controversial at EWC. There was a fairly sizable
                    component of the faculty and staff that was strongly anti-military, a throw-back
                    to the academic distrust of the military during the Vietnam era of the 60s. The
                    anti-military group wished to keep a focus on the South Pacific and on broader
                    issues such as the environment or energy.</p>
                <p>The University of Hawaii on Oahu at Manoa in part reflected the general Hawaiian
                    outlook; it is quite provincial, although it is in the middle of the Pacific and
                    styles itself as a crossroads to Asia. It is not as cosmopolitan as one might
                    find on the eastern seaboard or even on the western seaboard. Hawaii is remote,
                    and its people consider it to have its own culture, own identity, own economy,
                    and own problems. They tend to keep focused on their own collective navel. This
                    meant that the East-West Center had some leftovers from the sixties, such as the
                    protest movement, and anti-military sentiment was very strong. Some of them were
                    unreconstructed flower people.</p>
                <p>We had taken the SEAS group of military/security people to the East-West Center
                    for a couple of years previously and were getting a little better at developing
                    a program, I think. Usually, a day or day and a half was spent at the Center for
                    a generic overview of American culture, society, economy, etc. This provided a
                    base line of understanding the American political, economic, and cultural basis
                    for support of the security operations in the Pacific. Yet the flower people
                    targeted it in Hawaii and accused the East-West Center of kowtowing to the
                    military chiefs and becoming openly supportive of the military. So the SEAS
                    program came under specific attack, with critical articles appearing in the
                    local university newspapers, even some with scornful cartoons charging that the
                    Center was nothing but an intelligence operation for foreign military officers
                    from all over the Pacific.</p>
                <p>In a sense, this was partly true, because some of the people who were at the
                    seminar were intelligence officers in their home countries. In fact, we welcomed
                    them, because they were smart, fast learners and were important people in their
                    respective military establishments. They were an important audience for us to
                    have. This was particularly true for USIA. Around the world at different
                    embassies, the military is a very difficult audience for USIA to program. Their
                    interests involve subject matter that is difficult for a diplomatic organization
                    to handle comfortably. We can talk to schools. We can talk to government
                    officials or press. But when it comes to the military component of an audience,
                    it is very hard to bring them in.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>This is less so in Korea, because I remember when I was there, we had strong
                    relations with the local military academy. But in many Asian societies, the
                    military is still a very important component of public opinion, and they have
                    more power than they do in most other countries; more certainly than in the US.
                    Therefore, it was important for us to have this kind of contact, and as during
                    my first year in Hawaii, I think I was able to convince our people in Washington
                    that this aspect alone was sufficient to keep an officer in Hawaii working on
                    the SEAS program as hard as he could. It was probably one of the few places that
                    we really had the opportunity to have in-depth contact with the principal
                    military establishments of the Pacific region. Thirty-four countries is nothing
                    to sneeze at. And contact we did. By the time I left, the program had about 150
                    alumni all over the Pacific. Many of them were in very high positions in their
                    own military organizations.</p>
                <p>For example, when I was on one of the SEAS trips, I pinned the third star on a
                    Thai general who was promoted during the trip. We had any number of very strong,
                    politically centered people from the Minister of the Interior in Fiji, to
                    presidential advisors out of Mongolia; people who had direct input into the
                    foreign policy of their government. The SEAS program became a very critical
                    point of contact for us, with a large number of those who showed promise of
                    becoming very influential people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Chinese included in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes. They were one of my principal objectives when I arrived in Hawaii and
                    began work on the SEAS program, since I had just come from China. It was perfect
                    for the Chinese. We worked very hard on that, and it took a couple of years to
                    get it started, because the Chinese were very suspicious of our motives.
                    However, they were also hungry for the program, because it meant we would be
                    taking senior Chinese military officials into some very classified areas of the
                    U.S. military, giving them the chance to talk directly to military commanders
                    and make contacts not only with the U.S., but also with senior military people
                    we had brought together from all over the Pacific. The Chinese clearly saw that
                    as an advantage to them and could not resist.</p>
                <p>The first Chinese to participate was Major General Lee Zhi Yun, one of their
                    finest. He was a marvelous man. A consummate diplomat and a cool headed
                    negotiator. He was the head of the Study of Foreign Armies at the Beijing
                    Military Academy. His job was to teach senior military commanders about foreign
                    militaries. Students had to have stars on their shoulders to attend the classes.
                    He came and was a sensation.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>Part of the trip to Hawaii was a visit to ships, both the Aegis class cruisers
                    and submarines. We had a major general of the Chinese army for the first time, I
                    think, in contact with a wide variety of the newest and best of American
                    military tools. Real ground was broken, taking him down into the guts of a Los
                    Angeles class attack-sub where he was in the control room that had big signs on
                    the door “Restricted Area Do Not Enter.” He sat in the chair where people would
                    sit when the submarine was underway, and he could observe the mechanisms that
                    would control SOSUS cables and other devices that would track other ships and
                    detect submarines. This just blew his mind away. We also took him on an aircraft
                    carrier in Japan. Yokosuka is the home port for the U.S. Pacific fleet, and
                    there usually was an aircraft carrier there, most often the Independence. That
                    was always a remarkable visit for the Chinese. I only had two years of tours
                    with the Chinese on board, but that participation in the SEAS program was a fine
                    example to the Chinese of the American approach to “transparency” as a basic
                    principle of stable military relations.</p>
                <p>With some trouble, we also brought the Russians in. It took years to get them in
                    because of the infighting in Moscow. The Russians were very suspicious of the
                    program and several times accepted initially and then dropped out of
                    participation. However, they had an interest in participating for the same
                    reasons the Chinese did.</p>
                <p>The first Chinese participant, Major General Li Zhi Yun, and I had a chat in
                    Singapore before he went back to Beijing. When I went into his room, he had a
                    stack, which must have been an inch or 2 inches thick, of very carefully kept
                    notes in the middle of his coffee table. So he really had an eleven course meal
                    of security relations in the Pacific. The most striking part of the trip for
                    him, as well as for the US, I think, was in Korea when he went up to the DMZ.
                    There was a major general of the Chinese army going up to look at the North
                    Koreans from the other side. He never mentioned it, and so as not to embarrass
                    him in a situation where his understanding was more important than my curiosity,
                    I never asked, but he was certainly of the right age and rank to have fought in
                    the Korean War.</p>
                <p>One of the show pieces that the Koreans use on the DMZ is the infiltration tunnel
                    that was discovered a number of years ago and is now open for tourists to
                    clamber down into. You may recall a number of years ago when the South Koreans
                    discovered the infiltration tunnel. An engineer who had designed one of the
                    tunnels defected to the south and told the South Korean military where the North
                    Koreans began to dig, and on a piece of paper drew the direction the tunnel was
                    heading. In that indicated area, the South Koreans drilled a number of holes in
                    the ground. They knew the North Koreans were digging along the line, but trying
                    to find where was pretty difficult. But with the engineer's plans, they were
                    able to intercept the tunnel with a bored hole. Down the hole, they lowered a
                    camera with lights and looked around. It was all dark, and the North Koreans
                    claimed it was a coal mine. When they finally were able to complete an intercept
                    tunnel and actually climb down, the South Koreans discovered that the North
                    Koreans had coated the walls with lamp black, which would make the walls look
                    like coal.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>That was the little story we, like other tourists, were told before we went down
                    into the tunnel. Out of some concern for his relatively advanced years and with
                    some admitted excitement to be on hand when the encounter was to take place, I
                    followed MG Li down along the long staircase through the intercept tunnel. Sure
                    enough, when we got down to the bottom and entered the North Korean infiltration
                    tunnel, the first thing Major General Li did was to press his hand to the wall.
                    It came away black. He walked around for awhile and then we returned up the long
                    flights of stairs to the surface. When we emerged from the tunnel, the Chinese
                    general was still holding his hand stiffly out with all the black stuff on it. I
                    sat next to him on the bus and asked, “What is that?” He responded, “Can you
                    believe this?” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Look at this?” I said,
                    “Your hand is dirty.” He said, “Can you believe that anybody would be so naive
                    as to think anybody at all would believe this?” His incredulity was a stinging
                    rebuke to his North Korean allies who had made the original claim.</p>
                <p>On each of these SEAS trips, we would take escorts along from the U.S. military.
                    At that time, there was a member of the USCINCPAC J-5 group who was very
                    knowledgeable about Korea. He was Mark Shoemaker, a U.S. Army Colonel who had
                    been assigned on the DMZ for a long time. He sat with Major General Li in the
                    bus going up to the DMZ and was able to explain the military sights along the
                    way. There was a tank trap. Over there, you can see a camouflaged fortified
                    position, etc. He gave MG Li a full explanation that very much impressed him.
                    When we later arrived in Singapore, MG Li told me, “Look, I am a professional
                    military man with more than three decades of professional service. I found the
                    trip in Korea very interesting.” He continued, “It is an article of faith in the
                    Chinese People's Liberation Army that the U.S. and South Koreans are in an
                    offensive posture in the south and are waiting to pounce on the North Koreans.
                    But, I know a defensive position when I see one.”</p>
                <p>That was a remarkable observation from a senior member of the PLA. There are a
                    number of obvious features that supported that conclusion. When you go across
                    the Imjin river on the southern edge of the DMZ, the bridge is old and about
                    ready to fall down. It was pointed out in the lecture on the tour that the
                    bridge has charges underneath it, so it will drop immediately if there is any
                    indication that the North is beginning to come South. Obviously, the UN command
                    was not building reinforced invasion routes to the north.</p>
                <p>MG Li said, “Seeing is believing.” Being able actually to see the condition of
                    the South was convincing to him. He cautioned, “However, I am a professional
                    military scholar who observes foreign militaries as part of my responsibilities.
                    If I were a line commander and went back to Beijing, I could never say a word
                    about what I saw. No one would believe me, and all that I would accomplish would
                    be to bring harm to myself and my reputation. But I am an academic. I teach. My
                    business is to tell what I see. I can tell them, even though no one is going to
                    believe me. They will think I have been brainwashed here, that I have been
                    co-opted by the enemy. But the facts are there and gradually over the years - it
                    will take a long time - the Chinese military will come to understand what the
                    situation in Korea actually is.”</p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>To me, that was a telling moment of this particular program, because it
                    represented a senior set of eyes from the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army
                    looking at a situation from a new and different point of view. I suggested to
                    Major General Li that after he got back to Beijing, he make a point to go to the
                    North again and look at the same view from the Northern side for comparison.</p>
                <p>While we were on the way up to the DMZ near the Imjin River, there is a rest stop
                    just before you cross the bridge to enter the DMZ. It is the last point that
                    casual tourists can get to from the south. In the back of the restrooms and
                    souvenir shop, there is a small park with some of the weapons from the war. In
                    the park, there is also a train with the tracks cut to the north of the
                    northward headed engine. This is the train ready to go north when unification is
                    accomplished, or so the story goes. It is a symbol of reunification. While we
                    were walking around there with Major General Li, there was an older farmer
                    sitting over there smoking a cigarette and just sort of watching tourists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was over sixty years old?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I am sure he was easily over sixty years old. He was obviously a local,
                    and probably a resident in the area long enough to have been there during the
                    Korean War. He must have seen a lot happen.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we were standing there and, of course, Major General Li was in civilian
                    clothes - like an elderly gentleman of Taiwan - and I was obviously a long-nose
                    American. He smiled. I asked him to come over, so we could get a picture. He
                    obliged us long enough to pose with MG Li in front of the engine and then, with
                    the usual friendly and hospitable Korean gusto, shook hands with MG Li and me.
                    So I now have a picture of a major general of the Peoples Liberation Army of
                    China, standing with a Korean farmer, all smiles. I don't know what the man
                    would have said or done had he known who this particular Asian gentleman
                    was.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>We had another incident up in the north which I think revealed some of the value
                    of the trip. Indonesia for many, many years has been a non-aligned country. We
                    had Indonesians on the trip, particularly one very smart, capable, acerbic
                    professor of security affairs. One reason she was there was because she taught
                    in the military academy in Jakarta. Part of the general tour of the DMZ was a
                    visit to the site of negotiations at Panmunjom. When you go into the small
                    quonset hut where negotiations are actually held, the other side must be out.
                    However, the northern military remain outside of the building looking in through
                    the side of the building that resembles a long tube cut in half. When the tour
                    group enters, they close the doors at both ends and you can mill around inside,
                    and actually “cross into North Korean territory” (the other side of the table)
                    while the UN command representative gives a little spiel about the height of the
                    flags and all the cute vignettes they have about negotiations with the North.
                    While we were standing there, the North Korean soldiers were outside the
                    building looking in, taking pictures and scowling. They always do that, perhaps
                    to show a kind of disdain for the imperialist forces or whatever.</p>
                <p>The problem for them at this time was that this lady was from Indonesia and
                    considered herself non-aligned and a person of dignity. While I was hanging in
                    the back, she came over to me and said, “Why are they doing that?” I was
                    puzzled. “Doing what?” “That,” she said, indicating the windows where the
                    Northern Koreans were glaring and staring at our group. She said, “Why is he
                    looking at me like that?” Finally catching her point of frustration, I
                    responded, “You will have to ask him, I don't know.” “But that is rude,” she
                    sputtered. She was so upset, she could hardly speak. In an Asian sense, the
                    North Koreans were being disrespectful to her. They perhaps did not understand
                    who she was, but nonetheless, she recognized herself as a person who was
                    offended by the clear rudeness she was being subjected to from a fellow Asian,
                    and worse, a national of a nation her own country had often given international
                    support to. It was a rudeness that Americans would likely just look at as part
                    of the show. But to an Asian from a non-aligned country, this was extreme
                    rudeness, and she couldn't get over it. She carried that image with her at least
                    as far as the last days of the symposium in Singapore.</p>
                <p>I recall when we were in the process of de-briefing our participants on the
                    conduct of the symposium in order to get some feedback to be used to strengthen
                    subsequent SEAS programs, she again brought up that incident in Panmunjom. How
                    could it ever be the case that someone who they had supported for so long could
                    be so rude to one of them? It was inconceivable to her. I would guess that she
                    carries that image with her to this day.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>The second thing that was evident to Indonesians on the trip was the relationship
                    between the Koreans and the Americans. This was particularly important and was
                    demonstrated at Osan Air Base, outside of Seoul, where Korean pilots fly the
                    same equipment as American pilots, go to the same training, have the same mess
                    halls, obviously know each other and play golf together on weekends. Coming out
                    of an environment where the Dutch had for so long held Indonesia as a colony,
                    this was a remarkable kind of relationship. Filipinos don't think about these
                    things, because they have been for so long in association with American military
                    forces. But to somebody out of Indonesia with the Dutch tradition of
                    colonialism, it was very striking. One did not have to explain everything. They
                    could easily see the state of the relationship, and it was apparent that this
                    was a different environment.</p>
                <p>A different kind of thing was seen by a Malaysian general during his first visit
                    in Hawaii. As part of the Honolulu visit just to soften things up a bit, we
                    would go to a luau run by the Hale Koa Hotel. The Hale Koa Hotel is a military
                    rest-and-relaxation facility. On a tranquil evening walking back from the luau
                    to the Ilikai Hotel where the group was staying, the Malaysian brigadier tugged
                    at my sleeve and said, “I have a question.” “This place, is it for officers?”
                    “No, it is for anyone in the military,” I responded. “You have enlisted people
                    there?” I explained, “Most of the people probably are enlisted.” He said, “They
                    are staying together?” It was very difficult for him to understand, having been
                    accustomed to the old British concept that a mixing of the ranks was not
                    appropriate. But to see everybody able to sing together, carry on together, eat
                    together, to have a good time together, without any regard to rank or station,
                    was to him quite a revealing experience. Again, it was an example of a very
                    American kind of thing.</p>
                <p>The luau at the Hale Koa was a seminal place for observing Americans and their
                    culture. Because it was a military R&amp;R stop, elements of patriotism were
                    more visible than they might have been at a comparable hotel or night club in
                    the civilian community. I remember the Chinese major general was with us the
                    second year I took the group to the luau and there were 200-250 people out on
                    the lawn enjoying dinner, drinking, and the show. In the show was an MC in a
                    white suit who sings and carries on a constant dialogue with the audience. Of
                    course, there was the standard bit where the audience participates in a hula,
                    and other kinds of “where are you from?” questions to the group which usually
                    came from all over the US. Because we were a relatively large group, mostly
                    foreign, the MC (master of ceremonies) would recognize the several tables where
                    we sat. Usually one or more of our members would be asked to attempt the hula,
                    and almost always one of the more outgoing types would volunteer, with much
                    jeering and hooting from our tables. This helped to bring the group
                    together.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>At the end of the program, the MC had a standard routine that was used to close
                    the program. Since the Hale Koa Hotel not only accepted active military but
                    retirees as well, there was always a large contingent of older Americans on
                    vacation in Hawaii. He would ask, “Anybody here from the Spanish American War?”
                    There would be great laughter. “Anybody here from the First World War?”
                    Sometimes there would be an old frail hand rise in the back, possibly from
                    someone seated in a wheelchair. That was kind of remarkable and a sense of
                    wonderment would spread through the audience. Then he would go on listing the
                    conflicts right down through the Second World War, the Korean conflict, Vietnam,
                    the Gulf War, and all the different incidents when the nation was at war,
                    particularly in the Pacific. People would stand up, and everybody would applaud.
                    The MC would say, “I finally want to give some recognition to the veterans of
                    these different conflicts, because so often it is not given.” All would applaud
                    loudly.</p>
                <p>Even for an American, watching all of these people stand up gives one a sense of
                    reality to some of the stuff you see in the movies. It gives you an internal
                    buzz when you realize that there is so much history collected together in one
                    place. Our foreign military group was thunderstruck by this, because for them
                    most of the wars and military actions were the stuff of history books or
                    newsreels. Often they had seen those actions as American imperialism with
                    malicious intent. To see the real people who actually had been in those
                    conflicts, some of them obviously injured or disabled as a result, was an
                    incredibly powerful experience.</p>
                <p>Following the recognition of the veterans, everybody stands up, links arms and
                    sings God Bless America swinging back and forth. Here we had non-Americans from
                    20 or so different countries all linking hands, including the Chinese major
                    general, and singing at the top of their lungs God Bless America. To an
                    American, it is a sight that is as unbelievable as it was profound. Some of
                    those lustily singing with the rest were on the other side of the line in those
                    conflicts. In all the SEAS groups I participated in, there was never a critical
                    word said about the experience. Just the reverse, the luau evening spoke volumes
                    on a subject that would have been difficult if not impossible to explain to our
                    diverse group of foreign military. The emotion of the evening and the human
                    warmth of the event made it one of the most important elements of the SEAS
                    program.</p>
                <p>I had a hard time justifying a luau on our official expenses, but we were able to
                    do that by bending a few things such as subsuming the cost under the allowance
                    given to each grantee for board. Without doubt, it was worth the effort. What
                    they were taking out of the experience said a lot about the American spirit and
                    the attitudes of the American military. The social event also cemented
                    relationships within the group that were to be very important in subsequent days
                    as very delicate national issues were discussed and contrasted. It was far more
                    effective than anything we could ever have accomplished in a week of serious
                    lectures. So the SEAS program had a lot of facets.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>Another important part of SEAS was the “kick-off” session on the first day.
                    Everybody came in and sat around tables arranged in a square with all seats of
                    equal prominence. Of course, the group was drawn from nations that often have
                    been at odds. The Japanese and Chinese, the Singaporeans and the Malaysians,
                    Japanese and Koreans, etc. For example, every time they would come in for this
                    first session, the Japanese would sit on one side of the room and the Koreans
                    would sit on the other. They wouldn't talk to each other or look at each other.
                    By the time we got to Singapore, they were drinking buddies.</p>
                <p>At that first session, we gave time to each national representation, sometimes it
                    was two, sometimes only one, to stand and give a five minute presentation on the
                    security situation in their country. There was not enough time to be very
                    comprehensive, but the occasion required each person to stand and say something
                    to the entire group. It was a fascinating seminar in Asian relations, because
                    you went from a Nepalese brigadier who lambasted all his neighbors for
                    interfering in his country and causing trouble, to a Japanese who would give a
                    very comprehensive overview of the Japanese economic situation in the Pacific,
                    to a Korean who didn't share the Japanese view of the situation in the region,
                    to someone from China who felt beset by everyone. Gradually as the SEAS
                    symposium progressed and after three weeks of eating together, arguing together,
                    sleeping together, traveling together, the group formed remarkable bonds. It was
                    something like what happens at camp among children who spend several weeks
                    together during the summer. We now have a very strong alumni association from
                    these SEAS seminars. We have a newsletter which comes out every year and
                    indicates where former participants are now, what their titles and addresses
                    are, and what the experience was of the immediately preceding SEAS program.</p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>In most countries in Asia, there is a very strong tradition that sharing an
                    educational experience with someone makes you a life-long friend. That same
                    bonding was very active in the relationships among those participating in the
                    SEAS program. The professional connections established in the program was one of
                    its primary goals. If there comes trouble between two nations that prompts a
                    confrontation of arms, it would be useful to the cause of stability if a senior
                    officer on one side of the line were able to give a call to a similar ranking
                    officer on the other to see if the confrontation might be worked out
                    bloodlessly. The bonding the occurs in the SEAS symposia may be adequate to
                    accomplish the task. Recognition of the importance of the program was given in
                    the attention paid to SEAS in each of the capitals it visited. Usually the U.S.
                    Public Affairs Officer hosted a reception at the embassy, attracting not only
                    the presence of the U.S. ambassador and many of the senior members of the
                    mission, but also the military attaches of many of the countries represented in
                    the program. It was relatively rare that an essentially military group was
                    assembled for a social event. Spin-off benefits of the reception included more
                    frequent contact between U.S. military attaches and their counterparts in that
                    capital, but also the chance to “rub elbows” for each of the other countries'
                    attaches as well. It is common in Asian cultures to build strong bonds with
                    those with whom you study. If a person has been a student with another, there is
                    a life-long bond. This principle transfers to a variety of military programs.
                    For example, the Army Command and Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth in Kansas
                    trains a lot of foreign military, and they highly value the training as a mark
                    of a “fast burner” in their own military societies. When the SEAS group moved
                    from capital to capital, it was common for those who were Leavenworth graduates
                    to search out fellow graduates of that program and, once found, make great
                    efforts to get together. Remarkable interconnections run throughout many foreign
                    armies. The SEAS program became a very important coalescing point for each of
                    the posts we visited, in terms of bringing their military contact people
                    together in a situation where we could talk about something relevant to post
                    objectives.</p>
                <p>By the time we finished in Singapore with each of these groups, the consensus was
                    very clear. The U.S. military posture in the Pacific is one of maintaining
                    stability. We were keeping people apart, maintaining a commonly desired sense of
                    stability even though there were times that national interests among the Pacific
                    Rim nations were in conflict. To some, this smacks of “playing policeman,” but
                    for most, this was not the sense that prevailed. They, instead, saw the U.S. as
                    a benign presence, a buffer which separated the conflicted nations, giving them
                    time to sort things out short of outright conflict. There was no “arresting” or
                    “judging” on the part of the US. Just “being there” made all the difference.
                    That, of course, also meant that the U.S. was not a welcome player in the
                    internal conflicts of these nations. As long as we minded our own business and
                    simply hung around the neighborhood, we were welcome. If we crossed the line and
                    interfered, the mood was entirely different. Singapore was a prime example of
                    this principle.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>In Singapore, each of the SEAS groups would visit Paya Lebar, a Singaporean
                    airbase and important strategic military location for the city state. On one of
                    the SEAS trips, we included a Malaysian flag officer, and as far as anyone
                    knows, he was the first Malaysian flag officer ever to visit that airbase. Over
                    the years, Singapore and Malaysia maintained a wary distance from each other.
                    This visit of the Malaysian flag officer, if it did not really break new ground,
                    at least served to strengthen a needed communication and a building of trust.
                    Again, the U.S. played a benign, but central, role in improving that military
                    situation.</p>
                <p>Another example of the precedent-setting role of SEAS occurred when we took a
                    Chinese major general to Korea for the first time. I had a devilish time trying
                    to get him a visa from the Korean Ministry of Justice. Korea and China had just
                    opened diplomatic relations, and here was a senior member of the Chinese Peoples
                    Liberation Army wanting to visit. They tried but could not get a visa for him in
                    Beijing, even though there was a Korean Embassy there. I implored the Korean
                    Consulate in Honolulu to process a visa after he arrived in Hawaii but had no
                    success. Each time the embassy or consulate pointed down the road. So we flew
                    off to Tokyo without a visa for him for Korea. In Tokyo, I called the Korean
                    consulate and said I urgently needed a visa. The answer I got was “Well, it may
                    be difficult.” “Look,” I said, “This officer is coming with a group which is
                    sponsored by the U.S. government. We are bringing him to Korea on a study
                    mission of the military. Your foreign ministry people are involved in this, as
                    are your defense people.” Of course, because it was the Justice Ministry in
                    Korea that handles immigration and consular affairs, they evidently had no
                    directives on the visit of ranking military officers of the service that is the
                    “blood ally” of their sworn enemy.</p>
                <p>In desperation, I took a car from the American Embassy and went to the Korean
                    consulate with Major General Li Zhi Yun's passport, visa application, and
                    pictures. Finding the visa section, I asked for the consul and sat down in his
                    office, saying that I would not budge until I was got a visa placed in MG Li's
                    passport. We had to leave for Seoul the next morning, and if he did not get a
                    visa, there would be a major embarrassment for both Korea and the US. This
                    presented the benighted consul with a huge problem. After fretting a bit, but
                    unwilling to risk a bit of effrontery with his country's major ally, he got on
                    the phone and passed the hot potato up the chain to Seoul. The poor man really
                    sweated this one out. There were successive consultations with his superiors.
                    Each time he would hang up, glance at me - perhaps hoping I would somehow simply
                    disappear - look desperately downcast and quietly remain behind his desk,
                    sweating. Finally, after one of the wearying calls, he dejectedly reached down
                    and opened a drawer of his desk, took out a stamp, gave MG Li's passport a stamp
                    and a quick signature. Passing it to me with a weak smile, he said that he hoped
                    that would be sufficient. I thanked him well and departed.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Of course, the real test of the forcefully obtained visa was at the entry point
                    at Kimpo airport on arrival. I made sure that MG Li was immediately behind me in
                    the immigration line. To my surprise, there was not even a blink or pause from
                    the official clearing my group. I was certain they must have been fully briefed
                    on his entry and played their roles well. MG Li was, I expect, the first
                    high-level PRC military official to visit Korea outside of the formal diplomatic
                    mission and was a sensation, but everyone was cool, almost blas�. So that was a
                    good start.</p>
                <p>Everywhere we went with MG Li, we broke new ground with that man, because it was
                    so sensational. Yet the most common reaction from both official and non-official
                    Koreans was perfect disbelief. When we arrived at one of the senior think tanks
                    in Seoul for discussions, the printed guest list included MG Li as from the
                    Republic of China. I would have to say, not the Republic of China but the
                    People's Republic of China. I would get a blank look. Respectful, but blank.
                    Obviously the foreign guest, me, was sorely confused. They would look at me
                    deeply, perhaps scanning for other less obvious signs of dementia, turn away and
                    simply ignore my correction. They could not understand where this man was from.
                    Those who did understand the import of the visit were discrete.</p>
                <p>As in other aspects of the program, the mad Americans were indulged, but the
                    purpose of the visit was accomplished. MG Li went to the Republic of Korea. He
                    was treated well and was respectfully included in the discussions, along with
                    those who were also allies of the Republic of Korea. I have to believe that it
                    had a refreshing effect on those who met and discussed issues with MG Li. He was
                    articulate, forceful, and obviously well briefed on the PRC position. However,
                    the discussions were not exercises in name calling or polemics. Rather they were
                    polite encounters where the participants did not see eye to eye on important
                    issues but still could treat each other as respected members of the common human
                    race. A small, but important victory.</p>
                <p>It was incidents such as these that made the SEAS program so important for us and
                    important for those who participated in the program. Although it was expensive
                    because of the touring that was necessary, the food and transportation costs, it
                    was by far the cheapest thing we could do in terms of impact for the taxpayers'
                    dollar. We were able to consolidate an understanding among all of these nations
                    in the Pacific of what we were about, why we were there, what our intents were
                    and more importantly, why everybody else thought it was important for them to
                    have us there. This message was communicated directly to those in their military
                    organizations who were looked to for the development of strategy or
                    intelligence. They were the intellectuals who were an essential part of the
                    modern army, the thinkers who had much to say about the development and
                    direction of security policy in their own nations.</p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>There were many of these vignettes in each of the SEAS programs. I remember
                    several times when we would go to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, sit around a
                    table, and have a briefing by one of their very articulate people on the policy
                    of self-defense and the role of U.S. forces in Japan. Someone of our group would
                    ask, “Why do you allow the American military on your soil?” They would get the
                    answer, full blast. Essentially, “Because it is important to us and in our
                    national interest to have them here. We are not being nice to or cowed by the
                    Americans. We want them here, because they are important to us and they sustain
                    confidence in the region that we are not going to get involved in something in
                    the rest of Asia again.” That was a good and powerful message. They might have
                    gotten a different answer had we gone to Okinawa, but in Tokyo, the official
                    view was important.</p>
                <p>I think most understood it in the military sense, because when they got to
                    Singapore, it was also apparent to the SEAS group that Singaporeans had the same
                    feeling. Lee Kwan Yew, for example, offered Singapore as a way-station for
                    American forces in Southeast Asia and was soundly criticized by the Southeast
                    Asians at the time, but I think now in retrospect, they agree with his
                    initiative and he is benefitting by it commercially, because of contracts. These
                    messages were reinforced, because representatives from Japan, Korea, and
                    Singapore were traveling as members of the SEAS group and other members could
                    grill them for confirmation and details as they traveled from stop to stop.
                    Since they were becoming fast and trusted friends, the responses were credible
                    and accepted. This reinforced the message that in other situations would have
                    been very difficult to make convincing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there in this 1992-95 period, was there any

                </p>
                <p>YATES: Anything that happened in the Pacific was important to the command. One of
                    the stressful things at the time was the New Zealand problem. The New
                    Zealanders, of course, broke up the ANZUS treaty, and they were always placed in
                    a special category, because of their refusal to allow U.S. ships to visit New
                    Zealand ports unless the U.S. would confirm that the particular ship did not
                    carry nuclear weapons and was not powered by nuclear energy. Because of these
                    restrictions, the U.S. refused to send any U.S. warships to New Zealand ports
                    and placed special restrictions on relations between the two militaries. They
                    were not allowed, for example, to visit Camp Smith, USCINCPAC Headquarters,
                    because of this difference of opinion. If our ships could not visit there, they
                    could not visit us. The New Zealand nuclear question was an important one.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>While I was at USCINCPAC, the Sommers report was issued. This was a report that
                    was written by an independent, New Zealand study group that did an extensive
                    survey of U.S. nuclear warships and the amount of radiation leakage or potential
                    radiation leakage for ships in harbor. Of course, the position of opponents in
                    New Zealand was, if they allowed American nuclear ships to come in, their
                    harbors were going to be polluted. Besides, they reasoned, they would become a
                    target for anyone who wanted to throw missiles at U.S. forces. The crux of it
                    was nuclear pollution.</p>
                <p>The Sommer's report found that there was pollution in New Zealand harbors, but it
                    was from hospitals, the offal of radiation labs, the trash that was routinely
                    tossed into the water. It was determined that the nuclear active residue from
                    hospital gowns and things that were used in their radiation labs was the only
                    detectable source of radiation in the harbor. They went down to other harbors in
                    the world where nuclear ships were present and could find no evidence of nuclear
                    radiation. So, in fact, their greatest source of pollution was themselves.
                    However, they still maintained, “Yes, but...” And our nuclear policy trouble
                    continued.</p>
                <p>New Zealanders were invited to come along on the SEAS symposia as one of the
                    first indications of a softening of the U.S. stand against relations with the
                    New Zealand military. It was a low-key way to send a message. It took some
                    wrangling on the part of the CINC to get the policy straightened out so we could
                    get permission to have them actually at Camp Smith. In previous years prior to
                    the nuclear standoff, New Zealanders actually worked at Camp Smith as part of
                    the ANZUS group.</p>
                <p>The SEAS program did have a lot of difficulties, however, most of them made in
                    the USA. I mentioned before the problems with Japan and Korea in terms of other
                    commands. When we moved from place to place, we relied on the local commands to
                    support us. For example, we have a Status of Forces agreement with Japan, and
                    under that agreement, there are very explicit rules on who can use what. As
                    usual, we tried to keep costs to a minimum and reduce the cost of the trip
                    whenever possible. Staying downtown in a Tokyo hotel is very expensive, about
                    $200 a night per person. If we could put them in a U.S. military R&amp;R
                    facility, which is mainly for U.S. forces, it would cost us $70 a night. We
                    calculated that this would save the American taxpayer about $12,000 on each
                    trip. So, I immediately asked the U.S. Forces/Japan to allow us to put them in
                    the Sanno Hotel, the R&amp;R hotel in downtown Tokyo. We also had asked the
                    local command for a bus to pick us up on arrival at Narita and take us to the
                    hotel. That was fine, I was told, the Air Force had a bus that could pick the
                    group up at the airport. Where did we want to go? “To the Sano Hotel.” “You
                    can't go there.” “Why not?” “You are not allowed to.” “Sure we are, we are all
                    military.” Well, Americans could go there, Koreans could go there, but all the
                    other folk were not allowed under the Status of Forces agreement, since not all
                    of them qualified under the provision allowing those who were part of the UN
                    command forces from Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>In an attempt to square that circle, I got the Japanese Foreign Ministry to
                    express an opinion about the use of U.S. R&amp;R facilities for the SEAS group
                    and was told that the Foreign Ministry had no objection and would not protest
                    under the Status of Forces Agreement. But I couldn't get the old
                    stick-in-the-mud American forces to understand the perspective on this. We had
                    to come up with $12,000 additional American tax payers' money to pay for nothing
                    but the bureaucratic concerns, I guess, of the local U.S. Forces' Japan command.
                    We never got to use the Sanno Hotel, and that was too bad. As far as I know,
                    this is still the case. There was the fear that someone in the Japanese ministry
                    would take offense, and they would have an issue and they didn't want an issue.
                    We had asked the U.S. Embassy to be involved, the foreign ministry to be
                    involved, Japanese Self-Defense Forces people to be involved, and all expressed
                    the opinion that there would be no problem, but we could not persuade our own
                    military in Japan. That is a good example of the impotence of USCINCPAC in
                    directing actions of the U.S. Forces Japan on matters in which the bureaucracy
                    had a say. If CINCPAC could have simply issued a directive, the matter would
                    have been solved quickly. However, we needed a diplomatic arrangement to make
                    the wheels turn.</p>
                <p>In this case, there was insufficient power to force things to move in the
                    direction we wanted. U.S. Forces/Japan, is an independent command. The
                    Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Command could ask, make a request, but he
                    could not insist. The experience was an interesting perspective on how the
                    American military operates. Of course in a critical military emergency, there
                    are other devices to make things come together, but one wondered about the
                    efficacy of such plans in the face of immobility in small matters.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Camp Smith is a joint military post. You had a Navy, Marine, Air Force,
                    and Army presence there. So a Foreign Service Officer going into this military
                    mist was interesting. One thing that struck me was the very significant
                    intelligence of a lot of these uniformed people. These were intelligent people.
                    They saw the value of the SEAS program and gave it full support. Fifty percent
                    of the program was paid by the Department of Defense and the other half, by
                    USIA. It is an example of how two very dissimilar U.S. agencies can find common
                    ground and cooperate to get something done. I think both agencies benefitted
                    significantly from the program.</p>
                <p>Beyond that, the advisor's position in Hawaii was kind of fun for somebody who
                    had been a GI in Japan so many years ago. When I was in Japan, I was a lowly
                    Specialist 4th class on arrival in Hokkaido. To me, Camp Zama was Olympus. The
                    Pacific Command was beyond the imagined heights to me. To sit on the “Bridge” at
                    Pacific Command, being privy to all the meetings, involved in all the goings on,
                    and having the ear of the CINC for an old enlisted guy from Hokkaido was a
                    sensation. I had full colonels saying “Yes Sir.” to me in the hall. I had a
                    parking space reserved. It said “Director of USIA” which I had a lot of fun
                    with. All the people on the Bridge were called “Directors,” so I had the title
                    as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>I think that shows the decency of the military to take a civilian guy and accord
                    him that kind of civility. They are fine people, and to this day I count them
                    among my real good friends. They are highly dedicated people living under
                    difficult conditions. The housing in Hawaii was miserable. The military are
                    really second class citizens in that state. It was really sad, what was going
                    on. I don't think the Congress really understands. They all talk about
                    supporting the military and they are great shows at memorials, but when it comes
                    to giving them money so that they can live decently with their families, they
                    are not very good. A lot of the military personnel at the PACOM Headquarters
                    were the cream of the crop and could be successful in whatever they did. They
                    were fine examples of patriotic Americans devoting their professional lives to
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1995; where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I got involved in something in 1995 that was unique in my Foreign Service
                    career. In May, 1995, I was called and told of a team that was being formed to
                    go to North Korea as part of the liaison office. The caller, Spence Richardson,
                    and I had a brief conversation, but I was not interested at that time. I did not
                    think it was going to be a very pleasant situation. North Korea was cold,
                    hostile, and difficult. But the more I thought about it, the more I liked the
                    idea, because it was essentially the last real Foreign Service post available.
                    Even the newly independent states that used to be the Soviet Union were
                    essentially getting down to normal. The most exotic place I could think of was
                    North Korea. I had spent most of my academic and personal professional life
                    centered on Korea and this became a logical destination. I finally agreed to it
                    with a full commitment.</p>
                <p>I left then in June, 1995 and came back to Washington. Because I was going to go
                    to North Korea, I could not remain a USIA officer on that detail, so I had to be
                    seconded to the Department of State for the duration of my upcoming tour. I was
                    one of four at the time who were going to be moved to Seoul for a brief wait
                    prior to moving north. There were a couple of more people who were going to be
                    joining us later. The total that would have been in Pyongyang at the time was to
                    be seven, but we only had four in Seoul waiting to go. Initial expectations were
                    that we would have a scant few days in the South Korean capital before entering
                    North Korea, so a certain amount of hustle was in order. I had to get special
                    dispensation to get business class seats on a flight to Seoul, because there
                    were no economy seats and I could not wait without jeopardizing the smoothness
                    of the move. Just about all trans-Pacific seats were taken by participants going
                    to the Women's Conference that was being held in Beijing, and they were
                    transiting through Seoul.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>Much preparation had already been completed, and we fully expected that within
                    two weeks, we would be in Pyongyang to open the Liaison Office. It was going to
                    be housed in what used to be the old East German Embassy, which the West Germans
                    still had but didn't need. They almost turned it back, but we asked if we might
                    sublet two floors of the main building from them as office space. We had
                    apartments, office space, and garages in marginally decent enough conditions
                    that we could move in. Needed renovations to the apartment building could be
                    made later, as more families became part of the community. That was all set. We
                    had communications arranged. USIA had bought a computer to be used up there.
                    Although I was going as a State Department officer, obviously I was going to
                    have the portfolio of public affairs while in Pyongyang. To get up to speed for
                    my other duties, I had to return to Washington and take the consular course
                    which I had many years before fought hard against. I was going to be essentially
                    the principal “consul” as well as the “framework officer.” In that latter
                    position, I was to oversee compliance with the 1994 framework agreement with the
                    North Koreans in terms of nuclear questions.</p>
                <p>My wife and I moved to Seoul anticipating only a short stay, but after arrival, a
                    whole sequence of political and military events occurred to interrupt the
                    progress we had expected. The most dramatic of these was the capture of a DPRK
                    submarine on the east coast of the peninsula. In addition, there were Korean
                    local elections and whether or not the U.S. had a liaison office in the North
                    became an issue. The North Koreans themselves reneged on the agreement they had
                    already initialed providing for a Liaison Office. The agreement stipulated that
                    we would have diplomatic passage across the DMZ with pouches, mail, and a truck
                    driving across the DMZ to support the Liaison Office.</p>
                <p>There was little in the way of support for an office in Pyongyang. No
                    communications, no food, and no possibility of some grand local market supplying
                    us. Everything would have to be brought in, including computers, furniture, etc.
                    We were positioning stuff in Seoul at the time. When my wife and I moved to
                    Seoul, we packed up a few things for the trip and placed all the rest of our
                    household belongings in storage. When we arrived in Seoul, we had nothing but
                    suitcases of clothing and what is called a “welcome kit” that embassies usually
                    provide to people for temporary use until their household effects catch up. We
                    set up housekeeping in a temporary apartment while we waited to go North. It
                    could be days or as much as two weeks. It turned out to be longer than two
                    weeks. For the interim period until the details of the exchange of Liaison
                    Offices could be sorted out, our small group was placed in “North Korean Study”
                    at FSI. So I had to become a language student again. That was okay, I thought,
                    since I could brush up my rusty Korean. At FSI, we sat, never quite full
                    language students, since our attention was focused on the final move north, but
                    neither did we have regular positions. It was a limbo that was to extend
                    seemingly forever.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>I finally got to the North through a program which the Department of Energy was
                    operating with private contractors to assist the North Koreans in putting the
                    offending nuclear fuel into canisters. If you recall, as part of the 1994
                    Accord, we agreed to supply North Korea with heavy fuel oil to offset the energy
                    loss because of their agreement to take the reactor that was considered
                    dangerous off line. That reactor was capable of producing a nuclear fuel that
                    might be reprocessed into bomb grade material. As a result of the 1994 accord,
                    the North Koreans would shut down the “research” reactor in return for the
                    provision of heavy fuel oil from the U.S. and the eventual construction of two
                    new “light water” reactors, because they were considered much less capable of
                    producing the dangerous material.</p>
                <p>The North Koreans had removed the reactor's fuel and had stored it in a pool next
                    to the reactor building. That separate building had a large water-filled pool
                    about 15 feet deep where the spent nuclear fuel was kept in baskets at the
                    bottom. The rods were just stuck in these baskets like pick-up-sticks and
                    dropped into the water. That was how the fuel was kept in temporary storage
                    before it could be removed to another site for disposal. The problem was, those
                    spent fuel rods had to be controlled. The IAEA had a team on the site,
                    monitoring the fuel in the pool. The reactor was no longer working, but the
                    problem was putting this stuff into sealed, controllable canisters which the
                    U.S. government agreed to assist North Korea with as part of the settlement. The
                    South Koreans were going to build these two new less dangerous reactors for the
                    North Koreans, but they had to get these things off line right away. So the U.S.
                    Department of Energy had contracted with a team of U.S. engineers to help the
                    North Koreans clean up the excess radioactivity at the site and pick up the
                    spent fuel rods from the bottom of the pool and place them in canisters. Those
                    canisters were then to be sealed with IAEA seals and put into racks in the
                    bottom of the pool until the two new reactors came on line and the nuclear fuel
                    could be moved out of North Korea and disposed of.</p>
                <p>You may recall that North Korea had threatened to leave the international Nuclear
                    Non-proliferation Treaty to which it was a signatory. If it had done so, it
                    would have been under no obligation not to reprocess the spent fuel into nuclear
                    weapons grade material. This might then be fitted to the missiles being
                    separately developed and give the North Koreans the ability to market the
                    dangerous product to whomever came up with the price. Naturally, the fear was
                    that one of the “rogue” states of the Middle East would be a ready buyer. Such
                    an eventuality would have jeopardized the uneasy relationships in that unstable
                    part of the world and injected a nuclear component into that situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>Therefore, it was imperative that the dangerous spent fuel be placed in a safe
                    storage area under the supervision of the IAEA. Since there was no American
                    Embassy in Pyongyang, there was no protection for the American engineers going
                    in to work on the storage project. At the urging of the Department of Energy,
                    the Department of State agreed to supply a diplomatic escort. Since North Korea
                    is a signatory to the Geneva and other diplomatic conventions, they felt this
                    gave a measure of protection to the group, because there would be somebody who
                    was protected by those conventions and who could then blow the whistle on any
                    kind of problems that might have occurred. The assumption was that if one or
                    several of the Americans got into trouble or was simply charged with wrongdoing,
                    they would have no consular protection while so far from U.S. diplomatic
                    missions. So I and the others on the team we had in Seoul, and a variety of
                    other diplomats in Washington and in East Asia began the “circuit-riding” tasks
                    of escorting U.S. engineers into North Korea through Beijing and at the nuclear
                    site at Nyongbyon (it is spelled Yongbyon by South Koreans). We did this on a
                    rotational basis. Each would go in for two to three weeks, with the travel on
                    either end adding another week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were working out of Beijing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: No, I was working out of Seoul. It was an interesting concept, because the
                    North Koreans are so prickly about anything that deals with the South. Yet they
                    agreed to this arrangement. They knew what was going on. They knew where we came
                    from, as we had made no attempt to hide our southern residence. But the big
                    problem was getting enough Korean speakers to go in. It was not a popular thing
                    for people to do. Some would be intrigued by the opportunity to enter a country
                    that was different, even exotic, and the chance to go where so few outsiders had
                    trod was generally exciting. But their ardor quickly cooled when they discovered
                    the living conditions at the nuclear site and the dangers that were involved,
                    not only from the North Koreans in a security sense, but because the site
                    offered radiation threats that were not under the same safety controls common in
                    the U.S. and elsewhere. The North Korean technology to deal with matters of
                    health and safety at the site were not as sophisticated as they would have been
                    in other regions.</p>
                <p>However, the North Koreans are very good engineers, and from my conversations
                    with our engineers, most held very positive impressions of their skills and
                    safety consciousness. They didn't have much in the way of equipment, but they
                    were very sophisticated in their craft. That, I think, gave rise to a certain
                    degree of mutual respect that over a period of time was very positive.</p>
                <pb facs="0236" n="Page0236"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the North Koreans are very difficult to deal with. On my first
                    trip into North Korea, I was surprised to find that the conditions there and the
                    attitude of the people was remarkably similar to what I had found in the deepest
                    part of South Korea on my first tour many years before. I had been in Kwangju in
                    the late '60s, and the South then was more advanced than the North is today. Yet
                    North Korea had problems of a magnitude not seen at the time in the South. When
                    I began to travel to the North, the controversy had already begun about the
                    failed crops and the threatening famine. Flooding had already occurred before my
                    first visit. So when I went in, part of what I had to do was look to see if I
                    could gather some insight into what was happening in the North. I traveled from
                    Pyongyang to Nyongbyon where the reactor site is located. It is about sixty
                    miles north of Pyongyang. At the time I arrived, we had to take back roads to
                    get there, and it took about three and a half hours of driving over very poor
                    roads. North Korea must import all of its oil, so they chiefly use cement on the
                    roads. Cement is a local product. They also have severe winters. Anybody who
                    lives in New England would have recognized the damage done to cement sections of
                    road from frost heaves. The road was all broken up in places, and it really made
                    a hard, difficult ride.</p>
                <p>We would spend from two to three weeks in Nyongbyon, drive back to Pyongyang with
                    the rotating engineering crews and then fly back to Seoul via Beijing. You could
                    not get to North Korea directly from Seoul, and there was no other service
                    except from Moscow. I guess that was only once a week. So the two flights a
                    week, on Tuesdays and Saturdays to and from Beijing, were the best way to get in
                    and out. You were very, very isolated. Communications were not very good.
                    Telephones worked sometimes, and if you were in the Koryu Hotel in Pyongyang,
                    things were not too bad, but if you were in Nyongbyon, telephone communication
                    was very difficult.</p>
                <p>IAEA had a guest house there which was built for their needs by the North
                    Koreans. There are IAEA members who stay there on rotational duty monitoring the
                    nuclear site. They also revolve in and out on a similar schedule of two to three
                    weeks each time. There is always an IAEA representative present to monitor the
                    nuclear site, including the reactor from which the fuel was removed.</p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>When I first arrived, there was no real connection between the IAEA people and
                    the American engineers, although after a while, that dissolved a bit, because
                    they were living in the same spot; in such a unique and closed environment,
                    after a while you get to know each other. But officially, we were not supposed
                    to talk to each other or associate, because it was thought any warmth shown by
                    Americans toward the IAEA people would indicate to the North Koreans that the
                    IAEA was a handmaiden of American policy. We were bending over backwards to be
                    cool and distant from these IAEA representatives who were usually third world
                    people from Mexico, Nigeria, Egypt, and places like that.The guest house,
                    itself, wasn't bad. Actually the food there was much better than it was in
                    Pyongyang at the hotel. They had a cook who was able to get fair quality
                    materials from somewhere, possibly China. Everybody was paying hard currency,
                    and probably we were able to get anything we wanted. Nevertheless, the cook at
                    the guest house did a marvelous job of creating what his vision of Western food
                    was. He obviously had a cookbook somewhere, because he would come up with
                    amazing things. Some of his creations tasted a little different, but others were
                    really quite good, almost at a gourmet level. The fixings were not dependable,
                    however. Sometimes there were good mushrooms, a variety of vegetables, and lots
                    of chicken. The trouble was, when he found something fresh, you ate it for a
                    week. We had cucumber salad every time, all the time I was there. If he found
                    some tomatoes, you had tomato things; if he had onions, there were onions in
                    just about everything you ate. Breakfasts were not very good, and of the three
                    daily meals, the American breakfast is not very well understood in the rest of
                    the world. There was no orange juice or special items like that. You could bring
                    in your own fixings or condiments, but you could not bring in perishables,
                    because you never knew when you were going to get in.</p>
                <p>The rotating engineers would bring candy, M&amp;Ms, Snickers, and favorite snack
                    foods to keep up the sugar levels that were generally low in Korean cooking. You
                    could bring in material to read, but you couldn't leave it in places where North
                    Koreans would be able to see it. If one or another of the North Korean managers
                    at the rest house came across something offensive, they would confiscate it and
                    argue with you and tear it up in front of your face or demand that you store it
                    away; otherwise you would be accused of attempting to propagandize the people of
                    the North. By general agreement, however, the engineers were allowed to do
                    almost anything on the second floor of the guest house where most of the rooms
                    were. The situation even improved to the point where they were able to borrow a
                    videotape machine from the IAEA people and bring in some movies, although
                    sometimes those got into trouble if the subject matter was deemed inappropriate.
                    The only available recreation at the guest house was a pool table and a lonely
                    basketball hoop outside. If you wanted to use that, you had to bring your own
                    basketball.</p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>The guest house was on a corner outside the nuclear city. The old city of
                    Nyongbyon is a small walled town, one of North Korea's oldest settlements. The
                    only industry there, is a silk factory which recently had not been selling much
                    silk. The town was poor. Arriving at the site, you had to drive through the
                    town, cross the river, and then approach a whole new city, also called
                    Nyongbyon, on the other side of the Nine Dragons River, after which the guest
                    house is named. The new city is not walled in like the old but is surrounded by
                    barbed wire and several rings of guards. There were a series of security areas,
                    one within another, sort of like those nested Russian dolls. In the center of
                    these zones is the nuclear building and reactor. Around that was a military
                    compound. It resembles a treed college campus. It had been built in the early
                    seventies to be the North Korean nuclear research center.</p>
                <p>The North Koreans brought in a lot of their researchers who evidently were
                    trained abroad, probably in Eastern Europe, and who essentially stayed in this
                    compound. They were kept apart from their own society. Their life-style
                    distinguished them from their compatriots in other parts of the country. For
                    example, almost all of their houses and apartments had television antennas
                    sprouting from the roofs. That could not be seen in other areas apart from the
                    special cadre housing in Pyongyang. Inside the secure city, they had their own
                    factories which processed food from their own farms. They even had a Korean rice
                    wine factory. They had begun construction on a new cultural center for films and
                    art. Most of what they needed to exist was provided within the compound. There
                    were schools for the children and playgrounds. Connections with the surrounding
                    communities seemed tenuous. There was a bus that ran through the guard posts,
                    but few people other than soldiers seemed to ride it. Most appeared to be farm
                    people going to fields outside the perimeter. Yet despite its isolation, it
                    appeared to be a fairly sophisticated town compared to the other cities that
                    could be seen while traveling back and forth to Pyongyang.</p>
                <p>As a foreigner at this unusual city, there were special disadvantages. As a
                    foreigner, you could not live within the city. That would have created too many
                    problems. So they built a guest house outside the security perimeter, near the
                    Nine Dragons River on a bluff. Behind the guest house was a military
                    installation and in front was the river and the guards. At night time, you could
                    go out of the house, but you couldn't walk very far. You could walk down to a
                    big tree where Kim Il Sung had once stopped to give “guidance” to the people and
                    then return, as long as the round trip was done during daylight. In the winter
                    with long work days and short periods of daylight, that meant that there was
                    little opportunity for exercise. It was like being in prison. When you came
                    back, they closed the gate behind you. It wasn't locked, but there was an armed
                    guard at the gate holding you in. There were rice fields around you. There was
                    not much of anything to do at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>If you wished to be by yourself for a while, you were permitted to climb to the
                    top of the small bluff behind the guest house and look over the river. It was
                    pretty. There was a bench up there that you could sit on. But that was the
                    extent of the recreational facilities. On the second floor landing was a pool
                    table where the North Korean staff were permitted to go. It was the only point
                    where some sort of social contact was allowed with the North Korean staff at the
                    house. I am not really sure that it really had official blessing, but outside of
                    a television set in the lower lobby, which never seemed to carry much
                    programming, there was not much for our North Korean minders to do either.
                    Several of the North Koreans got very involved in playing pool, and the friendly
                    games got very competitive. If too many Americans got involved, however, the
                    North Korean staff became uncomfortable and usually left.</p>
                <p>The process involved with the “minders” is one of the aspects of living in North
                    Korea that is kind of controversial. If you read journalist accounts of North
                    Korea you will see a lot of commentary on the watching and “minding” that goes
                    on with foreigners.</p>
                <p>North Koreans have a bad reputation, sometimes it is well deserved, of closing
                    people in. Americans always seem to enjoy a sense of conspiracy. This often
                    leads to dramatic exaggerations of the North Korean suspicions. For example, I
                    was told they will not allow me to walk outside the hotel, and you are
                    controlled and watched every waking moment of the day. There will be cameras in
                    your room and the halls. Indeed, there are large mirrors built into the walls in
                    the halls of the hotel we were in, and it is likely, as it is in Beijing, that
                    halls and public areas are monitored. We always seemed to be placed on the same
                    floors of the Koryu hotel, although this could have easily been explained by the
                    relative lack of other customers and the high cost of fuel to heat in the
                    winter. Indeed, when there was a sudden flush of visitors and we had to take
                    alternate rooms, the rooms were usually cold and not made up as well.</p>
                <p>On the first night of my initial entry into Pyongyang, I decided to get some air
                    after the long trip to Pyongyang and take a walk. The minders congregate in the
                    lobby of the hotel near the front door, the only way out. Mine intercepted me
                    and said, “Where are you going?” “Well, I am going to take a walk.” “You can't
                    do that,” he responded. “Why not?” “You could hurt yourself, it is dark.” I was
                    adamant and a bit stubborn perhaps, because I had been told I would be
                    restricted and wanted to test the theory. “Well, it is not too dark, and I only
                    want a short walk,” I claimed. “I will just go out and walk a couple of blocks.”
                    My minder insisted that I stay in the hotel - “it is not advisable.” Finally, I
                    got them to agree if someone went along with me. I thought that was a reasonable
                    compromise. Off we went, myself and two guides, or minders. It turned out they
                    were right. It was really dark. There are no street lights even in the center of
                    Pyongyang, and the only light you had was an occasional passing car - and they
                    were very occasional. To make things worse, the sidewalks are not in very good
                    repair. There are potholes, cracked concrete, and things to stumble over and
                    break your head on. You could walk into a tree and not even see it. It was
                    really dark. People who are accustomed to cities do not understand how dark it
                    can really be in a city if there are no lights. Perhaps a country boy who grew
                    up under the stars might scoff, but in a polluted city there are no stars to
                    guide one.</p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>It was after 8:00 p.m., but since I was hungry, I invited my stalwart but
                    stumbling minders to go with me to a restaurant where we might get something to
                    eat. I got only a worried response that everything was closed. Naturally, I
                    disbelieved, thinking they just wanted to get me back to the controlled hotel,
                    but after stumbling around a few corners, I began to become a convert. Maybe
                    they really knew more about Pyongyang after dark than I was ready to allow. Yet
                    I still wanted to try to find something. They thought a restaurant down the
                    street might still be open. We stumbled off in the dark, made it to the
                    restaurant, and indeed, it was closed. We had to stumble back to the hotel, and
                    I ended up with them in the lobby bar, buying them a beer.</p>
                <p>The point of that little story is that, in fact, the guides probably had my best
                    interests in sight. It was dangerous for an American to go stumbling around in
                    the dark. First, you probably would get lost and, second, you could really hurt
                    yourself. Should you bring harm to yourself stumbling about in an unfamiliar
                    city in the dark, they would be blamed for your misfortune. So reports of the
                    deviousness of the “minders” are exaggerated and may be misleading. Of course,
                    they want to keep track of you and do not want you fraternizing with people.</p>
                <p>In addition, there is the myth of the “Potemkin Village” demonstration for VIP
                    guests. Foreign accounts of travel in Pyongyang are replete with vignettes of
                    stores stocked, but not open, and activities ostensibly only for the benefit of
                    curious foreigners. No doubt, there are some restaurants and other
                    establishments that are off limits. For example in Pyongyang, there are some
                    department stores which will take foreign currency, reputedly for the
                    convenience of tourists and foreign diplomats, and others that will only take
                    the local currency. But there are a number of other stores, ostensibly closed,
                    that will accept foreign currency despite the confusing instructions about
                    restrictions. So the confusion about restrictions does not make much sense. Walk
                    into any one of the several “foreign” department stores that are for foreign
                    currency, and they are packed with North Koreans. Many of them are just looking
                    around, but some people are buying and carrying things out of the store. The
                    bottom line is that a lot more observation is needed before conclusions can be
                    drawn.</p>
                <p>I wanted to go to department store #1 and was told it was off limits for
                    foreigners. But it was featured in North Korean tourist brochures, and I wanted
                    to get some souvenirs to take back to the South. That seemed to be the
                    convincing argument, because I went several times to department store #1,
                    sometimes with groups of American engineers in tow. I went through all its
                    floors. They had a whole corner of the store devoted to stuffed animals and
                    birds and oddities like that. You could buy foreign liquor there and shortwave
                    radios, which I thought was interesting. North Koreans don't have much money. It
                    is not a monetized economy. It is apparent that most of the citizenry are not
                    accustomed to a monetized society. They receive chits for rice, free housing,
                    free education, and free medical care, so they don't need money except for
                    cigarettes and beer, both of which are extremely cheap. You can buy a great big
                    bottle of Asahi beer for about two dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Asahi beer is a good Japanese beer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, and the North Koreans love it. It is very cheap, far cheaper than it
                    would be in Japan. It is obviously subsidized. You can buy cheap cigarettes in
                    North Korea also. They make cigarettes. I don't know where they get the tobacco;
                    perhaps it comes from the U.S. via China or Hong Kong. So a foreigner who likes
                    to smoke and likes to drink is in good shape in North Korea. Almost everything
                    else is by chit provided by the government. This means that as a North Korean,
                    you don't need money to exist. It is only for nonessentials that you use money.
                    So their low wages are essentially disposable income.</p>
                <p>Another commonly accepted theory is that of the “Potemkin Village.” As I noted
                    before, it is claimed that they put on a big show for foreigners. The stores are
                    not really stores. They will have goods stacked up neatly, but nobody ever
                    touches it. You go in and look around, and nobody is there, and as soon as you
                    leave, they close it up. You ride down the street, and you see all these stores,
                    and they are all closed. So there are no stores, nothing for the North Koreans
                    to buy.</p>
                <p>That is not quite true. While it would be hard to define North Korea as a
                    consumer society, they run things differently in their society than we do. A
                    store here in the U.S. might open at 10 in the morning and stay open until 10 at
                    night. Not in North Korea. They won't open in the morning. They will open at
                    lunch time which sounds to an American like a crazy system. But as was explained
                    to me, the theory in North Korea is that everybody is a worker and after
                    breakfast you go to work. If you opened the stores in the morning, there would
                    be no customers, but at lunch time when there is an hour off, there are many
                    people on the street and, sure enough, when I checked at that time, the stores
                    were all open. These goods are all lined up neatly in the morning, because the
                    workers have nothing to do but make them neat until lunchtime when they sell
                    them and then afterwards straighten them all up again.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the stores are not crowded as we would expect in our own society, but you
                    do see people standing in line in front of stores waiting to get in. The stores
                    in North Korea are operated, as we would recognize in the old days, as general
                    stores where you walk up to a counter and say, “I want a sack of flour, some
                    lard, and crackers.” They then go and get your flour, lard, and crackers and
                    pass them across a counter in exchange for your money. That is the way stores
                    operate in North Korea. You stand in line to get to the counter. When you get to
                    the counter, you order what you want and you take it home. It is a little
                    different than the walk-around-the-supermarket-with-a-cart experience we have.
                    Foreign observers, glancing at the empty stores on their way from the airport to
                    the hotel and back, are not learning much about the system.</p>
                <pb facs="0242" n="Page0242"/>
                <p>A second myth that turned out to be fiction was that there are no such things as
                    gas stations in North Korea. You can ride around Pyongyang for hours without
                    seeing a gas station. The reason is, North Koreans think gas stations are dirty,
                    which I guess has some point to it, and they put them down back alleys. Sure
                    enough, once you know the code, you ride down a street and see a little blue
                    sign up in the corner with a little arrow on it. That is the petrol sign. You go
                    down that alley, and the station is in the back somewhere. There are very few
                    cars anyway, although the numbers are growing. I was in a traffic jam in
                    Pyongyang only once. They have mostly Russian and East European bloc cars,
                    although a fair number of Volvos, which is interesting, and a lot of Mercedes.
                    The North Koreans or someone in North Korea deemed the Mercedes as the best car
                    in the world and decided to build them. So for a time, there was a North Korean
                    Mercedes that was being built. The products of that effort look like Mercedes,
                    except that there is a five- pointed star on it instead of the usual Mercedes
                    three-pointed star. The five-pointed star, of course, is their red star. The
                    paint tends to be runny, and the wheel covers tend not to be the magnesium type
                    that you are familiar with. So it is a little different, but looks like a shabby
                    Mercedes about ten years old. I don't think they are making them anymore.</p>
                <p>I know they never paid for the Volvos. That is one of the problems with the North
                    Koreans; they buy things and never pay for them. When I was there, they had a
                    Swedish delegation trying to arrange for the payment of about $350,000 worth of
                    Volvos that the Swedish taxpayers had paid for, because their government had
                    guaranteed the export arrangement. Volvo got its money, but the Swedes did not.
                    The Swedish government is trying to recover it. That is one of the problems with
                    the North Korean economy; they do not have any money. Because it is a
                    non-monetized economy, they do not benefit from the multiplier effect in the
                    economy. If the multiplier effect is not working, then money is not being
                    generated as it moves through the economy. Without generating money they can't
                    buy anything. So it is a “catch 22.”</p>
                <p>Our U.S. engineers would go in, in groups of about eight and usually a head
                    engineer or the vice president of the company. There were several U.S. companies
                    involved under contract with the Department of Energy. In fact, all of my
                    expenses and escort expenses were funded by the Department of Energy. I was a
                    USIA officer, working for the Department of State being funded by the Department
                    of Energy. It was a strange arrangement.</p>
                <p>But we would go in, if we could get in. One of the problems of getting into North
                    Korea was that you had to have a visa, but North Korea doesn't give visas like
                    normal governments; they give you a piece of paper with your picture on it,
                    which they stick inside your passport. But even that wasn't good enough to get
                    you into security places. For example in Nyongbyon, we had to get a separate
                    pass to allow us to get through the different parts of the guard structure - the
                    municipal guards (police), the local army guards, and the security apparatus
                    around the nuclear center itself. When I arrived for the first time in the fall
                    of 1995, army troops occupied mounted machine gun nests at the access points
                    around the compound of the nuclear city. By my third visit, about a year later,
                    those emplacements had been removed, and there did not seem to be much of an
                    explanation why. Security in the nuclear compound had appreciably
                    diminished.</p>
                <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                <p>Still, every time you went in and came out, you had to stop at every guard point,
                    and there were four of them to go through to get into the reactor site. Every
                    morning, we would have to go through the four posts. If you went back for lunch,
                    you had to go through all four posts to reach the guest house outside the
                    perimeter. Going back to work meant going through the four posts again. You had
                    to come to a full stop and show all your documents at each stop, every time you
                    went in or out. They didn't inspect the drivers or the guides. The drivers had a
                    very unique position. First, they commanded the cars, but they also probably had
                    more authority than drivers would in other parts of the world, because they were
                    part of the intelligence establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably like the proverbial KGB chauffeur, Colonel
                        Chauffeur. Something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, that is right. By the time of my second trip, they had opened a new
                    highway, a four lane limited access highway which ran past Nyongbyon up to
                    Myohyangsan, which is a tourist site. That's where the Kim Il Sung memorabilia
                    exhibition containing the gifts the former “Great Leader” received from foreign
                    guests are on display. It resembles an airport gift shop in other parts of the
                    world, in the sense that the selection of gifts is undifferentiated, ranging
                    from the truly artistic to the banal.</p>
                <p>When the drivers took their charges back and forth on this new highway and
                    reached the crest of a hill, they would coast, which wasn't a good idea in a
                    power steering equipped car. Remember in the '40s when there was a gas shortage
                    because of the Second World War, people would coast. My father would do that to
                    conserve gas. In the same manner, when the North Korean drivers would get to the
                    top of the hill, they would shut the engine off, coast down to the bottom, and
                    restart the engine. Sometimes, they would simply put the car in neutral and then
                    back into gear at the bottom. Their belief, I suppose, was that they were saving
                    gasoline. There was a great deal of debate in the American press about the lack
                    of fuel in North Korea. The claim was that the North Koreans were running out of
                    fuel. I never saw any evidence of that in specific terms. There were cars,
                    trucks and buses all over the place. The buses were empty most of the time, but
                    the trucks usually were carrying military people or people going to the fields;
                    they carried very little produce.</p>
                <p>You could see ox carts still hauling brush for fuel. North Korea was still very
                    much a third-world country. They were cutting off the branches of the trees in
                    the country side to about eight feet high, so the tree wouldn't be killed but
                    the lower branches could be used for fuel. There were deforested places, but
                    elsewhere, they were being smarter. They knew there was going to be more than
                    one year of famine, and if they cut the tree down for use this year, next year
                    they would really be cold, because there would be no trees left. So they lopped
                    branches off at the bottom.</p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>They were using the ice in the winter time along the rivers to take sleds to
                    parts of the terrain that were inaccessible by road or path. They would use the
                    sleds to go up the river and cut the branches off trees lining the banks of the
                    river and drag them along the ice back to the villages and homes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the period of time that you were making these
                        trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: From when I was assigned to Seoul in August 1995 until late 1996 when I
                    returned to the US. About a year and a half.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many trips did you make?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: I made three trips. The total time I spent in North Korea was about two
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you being debriefed when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes and no. I obviously reported in cable form when I got back, but a
                    formal debriefing, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the death of Kim Il Sung?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: No, I was there after that. However, I was there during the 50th
                    anniversary of the Party. The problem at Nyongbyon was that there was nothing
                    for the engineers to do, so we tried to figure out things that might provide
                    some recreation. They worked on Saturdays, so it meant only Sundays were free.
                    We could take a car and drive to Pyongyang. We could go to the hotel, get a
                    room, and sit in the bar. It was at least a change of scenery, and there were
                    sights to see.</p>
                <p>One of the weekends on my first trip on October 10, 1995 was the 50th anniversary
                    of the founding of the Korea Workers Party. Some of the guides knew we were
                    interested in doing some touring and asked whether we would like to see the
                    show, if they could get us some tickets. Most of the engineers thought that was
                    a great idea. I told the guides that, if we could be given firm assurances that
                    we were not going to be put into a compromising position, that we wouldn't go to
                    any of the places we otherwise would not go to like the memorial to Kim Il Sung,
                    for instance, we could probably go. However, if anything happened that I thought
                    was wrong, then I would take the engineers out immediately. We would stand up
                    and leave, possibly embarrassing our hosts. If they understood the conditions
                    and understood that we would walk out if compromised, we would accept the offer
                    to see the show.</p>
                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>Off we went. It turned out that the apparatus in North Korea is not very well put
                    together. It is a small country but incredibly bureaucratic. The guides had lots
                    of trouble getting us tickets, but we were finally given admission tickets to
                    the foreigners' stand for the ceremony at the Kim Il Sung Square in the heart of
                    Pyongyang.</p>
                <p>We left about 7:30 a.m. and got to the square around 7:50. There were no seats,
                    just wide flat concrete areas, arranged amphitheater style, flanking the
                    platform where the leadership stood to wave at the masses below. On one side was
                    the Party cadre, and on the other side, the military, and below that, the
                    foreigners' stand for ambassadors and people from embassies on the right hand
                    side of the podium. So we got shunted off to the right. I had dark glasses on
                    and a hat. The only way you could tell I was a foreigner was because I was
                    differently dressed than the rest of them. But you couldn't tell who I was. Our
                    instructions to the engineers were not to associate or talk with people, to just
                    watch, no politicking.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of diplomats there, Bulgarians, Russians, etc. We were also put
                    together with the Party faithful from abroad: the northern Chinese who are
                    adherents of the communist way and some Japanese from the Japanese communist
                    party who had come for the celebration. We were all together, milling about.
                    Things started to move at 8:00 in the morning and lasted until almost noon. It
                    was hot, and it was long. However, it probably was the most spectacular thing I
                    have ever seen in my life. All the citizens of Pyongyang were spread out before
                    us.</p>
                <p>We had one representative of the institute managing the project for the
                    Department of Energy who was not interested in the show. He was a jogger and
                    said that he was going to jog. The guides became very upset. “What do you mean,
                    you are going to jog? You can't jog.” The DOE rep was adamant. “I want to jog.”
                    “You can't jog,” responded the guides. “Why not?” insisted the American.
                    “Because you will be arrested if you do.” “I am an American and can go anywhere
                    I want,” he persisted. “No, you can't. Nobody in Pyongyang can go anywhere they
                    want. The city is shut. Anybody who lives in this city will be at the square by
                    order. You don't have an option. Anybody not in the square this morning will be
                    arrested, you included.” So very reluctantly, he was dragged along with the rest
                    of us. The celebration consisted of about half of the people of Pyongyang in a
                    parade with floats and cheering members of work units. The other half of the
                    citizenry was in the square waving plastic flowers, red and pink and some
                    yellow. They choreographed these flowers into signs and symbols. Whenever they
                    mentioned Kim Il Sung, they showed the sun. Whenever they mentioned Kim Jong Il,
                    Kim Il Sung's son, there would be a star. The parade of silk banners was a
                    marvelous thing to see.</p>
                <pb facs="0246" n="Page0246"/>
                <p>The first thing in the morning was a formation of the military, which filled the
                    square. The military leadership made speeches. They had just appointed four new
                    marshals in the North Korean command, so those marshals were there and reviewed
                    the troops in these very long black Zivs, big Russian cars, and a Lincoln and a
                    couple of other Western cars. They rode in circles, reviewing the troops, and
                    then the troops marched off. There was no brandishing of arms. Few of the
                    assembled troops had arms at all. After the troops had marched out of the
                    square, the mass of citizens who were “hanging in the wings” behind the
                    buildings flooded into the square in this mass of pink. The women were dressed
                    in a modified, shorter, version of the traditional Korean Hanbok and the men
                    wore suits and ties. It was quite an amazing show. This continued until all had
                    arrived at their proper place, and then the parade started.</p>
                <p>After the military speeches and the review of the troops, Kim Jong Il came in, no
                    more than 50 feet from where I was standing. He leaned over the edge of the
                    baluster there and waved at all the foreigners. We were told that no pictures
                    were allowed, and all of us respected the request. But it was remarkable to see
                    him so close. He didn't look as sick or disheveled or as monarchical as he does
                    in some of the Western press photos. He went off to receive the accolade of the
                    crowd and stood there for hours, waving. He did evidence considerable boredom,
                    and perhaps it is understandable, given that the parade went on for almost four
                    hours and everyone had all eyes on him.</p>
                <p>After Kim Jong Il arrived, the parade started. There were thousands of people
                    with floats, lots of silk flags. After the four hours standing on the cement
                    flats, we were impressed but relieved that the marathon was over. We were told
                    we were going to take a break for lunch and then in the afternoon were the
                    gymnastics. We went back to the hotel for lunch and then went out to the Kim Il
                    Sung Memorial Stadium where just about all of the student population of
                    Pyongyang was assembled. They did marvelous things with card flipping. They
                    would make entire pastoral scenes and then a picture of Kim Il Sung, and then a
                    picture of his son, a lot of slogans and things. Hundreds of these were done by
                    all these school kids about 13, 14, 15 years old under direction from the
                    ground. They had cheerleaders down there. I do not remember seeing more than one
                    or two mistakes made in the several hours of constantly changing pictures. There
                    were thousands of these kids.</p>
                <p>After the sloganeering and marvelous pictures of the card flippers, the
                    gymnastics started with an incredible display. I had seen a fair amount of
                    Chinese gymnastics while stationed in Beijing, but the kids in the stadium gave
                    nothing to the Chinese in their display of skills. Much of the display ran with
                    multiple activities in different parts of the stadium simultaneously, a
                    “multiple ring circus” that somehow all fit together into a seamless whole.
                    People tumbling in the air, ground vaulting, and all sorts of juggling, all
                    taking place at the same time. Kim Jong Il was there also. We were seated
                    further away. We certainly weren't given very special consideration up in the
                    stands, off on the side. We could take all the pictures we wanted of the
                    gymnasts, but couldn't turn the cameras on the leadership podium.</p>
                <pb facs="0247" n="Page0247"/>
                <p>Our minders carefully observed the ground rules of our attendance. The extent to
                    which the minders were careful about the instructions I had laid down before we
                    had agreed to go, was illustrated during the morning celebration. The TV cameras
                    were constantly roving over the crowds and the displays of adulation, but during
                    a lull in the celebration, began to pan across the crowd of foreigners,
                    obviously showing the foreign dignitaries who were attending the celebration. At
                    the time the camera came very close to where I was standing, one of the minders
                    saw it coming and stepped between me and the camera and stood there until the
                    camera left. I wouldn't have cared so much, because with my hat and sunglasses,
                    nobody would be able to tell me from any other European, but nonetheless, the
                    point was, he kept his word which was much more important to me than any
                    possible photography.</p>
                <p>I found all the way along that the North Koreans were very careful about the
                    agreements that were made. If the agreements were broken, either they had a very
                    good reason, or they did not feel they themselves had broken them. We had one
                    incident during my first visit when I wanted to visit the East German compound
                    to see the Swedish representative who handled American affairs in Pyongyang at
                    the time. I wanted to meet him, say hello, and set up procedures to be used if
                    we had problems in Nyongbyon. Because the Swedes provided some diplomatic
                    protection, the assistance of this Swedish representative could be invaluable in
                    times of emergency. It was getting dark, but that was not of concern to me. I
                    said that I wanted to take the car and go over and see the Swedish consul. My
                    minder of the moment said, “Does he expect you?” I said, “No, but I would like
                    to knock on his door and say hello.” “Well, it may be a problem.” “Why?” “Well,
                    we don't know where the German Embassy is.” That was one of the largest
                    embassies in Pyongyang and our foreign minders didn't know where it was? That
                    was unbelievable. I said, “I really have to go. I want to do this.” “We will see
                    what we can do,” was the response.</p>
                <p>It was about 4:30 in the afternoon, and it gets dark in Pyongyang in the winter
                    time pretty early. They worked for half an hour and then came back and said, “We
                    can't find it. We have called the foreign ministry, and we just can't locate the
                    German compound.” I said, “Well, what are we going to do?” They suggested that
                    we take the car and try find it, so we all piled into the car I had rented and
                    rode off into the mists of Pyongyang. We crossed the river into the diplomatic
                    quarter where we stopped here and there, asking security guards where the East
                    German Embassy was. In Seoul, I had seen a map with the general location of
                    where it was but had nothing else to guide us. We took a few wrong turns but
                    eventually did find the place. By that time, it was dark and there was a guard
                    out in front. I got out of the car, a Westerner, and approached the gate. “Who
                    are you and what do you want?” I was asked. “I want to see the Germans.” The
                    guard's response was a simple, “Okay.” My minders had to stay in the car, since
                    they were not allowed to go into the embassy, but I could.</p>
                <pb facs="0248" n="Page0248"/>
                <p>I had one of the engineers with me, and the two of us went into the compound
                    which was already completely dark. We felt our way along and saw a light in an
                    apartment building toward the back. Europeans don't keep hall lights on very
                    often to conserve energy. We went up some stairs and banged on a door with light
                    showing under it. I don't know what the occupants thought, I never did find out,
                    but they came to the door; getting a bang on the door in the middle of the night
                    in North Korea from people you don't expect must be quite sensational. It turned
                    out they were newly arrived, a young German diplomat and his wife. Nobody that I
                    wanted to speak with was at home, so it was not a very successful visit. But at
                    least I had gotten into the compound, met somebody, and gotten back out. The
                    important part of the story is that my minders worked very hard to locate the
                    German compound when they could have made their lives a lot easier by simply
                    denying that we were able to go. They were really embarrassed that they did not
                    know where the compound was, when first asked. The North Korean bureaucracy is
                    very compartmentalized, and as I gradually learned more about that unusual
                    government, I more fully understood why my minders had such a problem.</p>
                <p>I have another tale that also speaks to the purposes of the minders. When I was
                    getting close to leaving North Korea after my first trip, I wanted to take some
                    kind of candy back to Seoul as a souvenir for my instructors at FSI and others
                    in the South. I was unable to find anything suitable. I mentioned this problem
                    to my minders, and they scurried off. Two hours later, they came back and said,
                    “We have checked all over town. The only place we can find to buy something
                    resembling what you want is up in the hotel bar.” Sure enough, upstairs in the
                    bar tucked behind the counter were some boxes of candy. It tasted terrible. But
                    nonetheless, that was North Korean candy which I could take back to the South.
                    But they had worked the better part of the morning, trying to locate the source
                    of my desired souvenirs. I think their spirit of conscientiously trying to do
                    something right is pretty strong.</p>
                <p>I later had a different experience while on a negotiating team in my last visit.
                    I was the State Department representative for a negotiating team that was run by
                    the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and headed by Norm Wolfe, an Under
                    Secretary at ACDA, to negotiate some of the final parts of the spent fuel
                    arrangements. The canning operation was ongoing, but there were some problems
                    with the details of the work schedule in the final stages of the canning
                    process. Some of the positions of the North Koreans that we thought did not have
                    any merit turned out to be based on things of which we had no understanding.
                    That happened a number of times in my North Korean experience.</p>
                <p>You may remember in the press a couple of years ago, we had accused the North
                    Koreans of siphoning off the fuel oil of the first shipment and diverting it to
                    other purposes. Their tally of how much had been taken in was different from
                    ours. Their's showed less and ours showed more. We said, “Aha!” The press had a
                    field day, saying that they were stealing the fuel.</p>
                <pb facs="0249" n="Page0249"/>
                <p>It turned out that our technology was overly sophisticated and had given us
                    incorrect readings. We used technology utilizing sound waves to measure the flow
                    of the heavy fuel oil, which meant we did not have to put anything into the fuel
                    flow itself. It was an acoustic process by which you could tell the rate of flow
                    by, I suppose, the doppler effects on the reflected sound. The North Koreans
                    were adamant that their figures were correct. They used an old propeller system
                    directly in the flow of the oil. The number of times it went around indicated
                    the amount of fuel flow. What happened, as it turned out, was that the fuel
                    going through the line was at a colder temperature than we expected. Since the
                    acoustic properties of the fuel change under those conditions, we had to
                    re-calculate our own totals. In fact, the North Koreans were right and our
                    figures were wrong, despite all of our high tech equipment. Nonetheless, the
                    American press had made much ado about the possible fraud, but made much less
                    about our foul up of the data.</p>
                <p>A second incident of the same kind occurred when the North Koreans wanted to stop
                    work on the canning of the spent fuel. We said, “Ah, dragging their feet.” This
                    was a charge that was leveled at them regularly. The crane was broken. They had
                    a holiday. Their men were sick. Or the radiation is too much over the pool. They
                    complained that the American engineers were coming and going in the replacement
                    shifts, but their people were staying and working in the same conditions month
                    after month. The American engineers were working 12 hour days, from 8 in the
                    morning until 8 at night over the pool and for them it was all right, because we
                    had these very fancy, and expensive, dose meters, which were cumulative in
                    determining the amount of radiation that an individual was receiving. They
                    assigned one to you on arrival, and you wore it all the time. Additionally, all
                    American engineers were examined with a full body count done periodically to
                    make sure they did not exceed the Department of Energy's standards for allowable
                    levels of radiation exposure.</p>
                <p>However, it turned out that the North Koreans didn't have any of that fancy
                    equipment or sophisticated exams. All they had were the film badges which only
                    indicate when too much exposure is received over a brief period. They had
                    nothing showing the actual cumulative exposure. The way they measured total
                    possible accumulated exposure was by taking a Geiger counter and placing the
                    sensor out over the pool containing the spent fuel while taking a reading. A
                    “health physics” technician would then multiply that by the number of hours the
                    crew was above the pool. The problem was, if you do that, you are not taking
                    into account the shielding of the platform and other obstructions from things
                    above and surrounding the pool. Our crew with the dangling badges would have an
                    accurate reading, but the North Korean crew's accumulation estimates were an
                    average based on the sensor reading taken directly over the pool. That meant if
                    an engineer was suspended directly over the pool for that amount of time, that
                    was the amount of dosage they would receive.</p>
                <pb facs="0250" n="Page0250"/>
                <p>Of course, nobody would be suspended directly over the pool for that length of
                    time, because they walk back and forth for tools, take breaks, etc. Our argument
                    was that there was plenty of space for that, but they were adamant that, because
                    of their health concerns, the exposure of their crews over the pool was high.
                    Finally, we got the idea that the only way they had to determine dosage was to
                    assume the maximum. By doing so, it meant they were spending too much time over
                    the pool and greatly exceeded Department of Energy standards.</p>
                <p>It took a long time to wrangle that down to where we understood what they were
                    talking about. They had a good point, and once it was recognized, we were able
                    to come to an agreement on time to be spent over the pool. Although we were
                    happy to have our engineers in over the pool for longer hours, the Koreans
                    absolutely refused. They said that if we gave them the equipment so they could
                    test in the same manner as we did, then we could talk about it. These things are
                    $500-$600 a piece, and we weren't about to start handing them out like cookies
                    to all the Korean workers and people who were in the pool area. But in fact,
                    they were being very careful in a dangerous situation with their people. I think
                    in retrospect it was something very difficult for us to argue with. Their
                    intransigence was not so incomprehensible when you began to understand it from
                    their point of view.</p>
                <p>One of our major problems in dealing with the North Koreans was that the
                    Americans did not speak Korean. Even in the negotiations I spoke of, we did not
                    have a translator. The only American who had any Korean language was me. The
                    only place the negotiating team could go to converse was out in the street. We
                    had to call for a recess in negotiations and all trundle downstairs and walk
                    around the block. I would tell Norm Wolfe, the head of the delegation and a
                    lawyer, that they didn't understand what we were talking about. First off, we
                    should not use any legal jargon that is popular in the US, for their translator
                    did not understand it and could not render an accurate translation. My
                    impression was that the translator was guessing a bit and thereby throwing
                    negotiations off the track when our points did not make any sense to the North
                    Korean side. Secondly, the North Korean- supplied translator in translating from
                    Korean into English was doing things that were extremely annoying to Norm
                    Wolfe.</p>
                <p>For example, every time they would refer to Wolfe, instead of saying “him” or
                    “you,” he would say, “Mr. Norman Wolfe,” using his full name. That drove Wolfe
                    crazy, because he thought they were needling him. He was not being needled; it
                    was simply a case of the translator trying to be too fussy. The translator was
                    trying to be polite, but he was doing so in a very irritating fashion.</p>
                <pb facs="0251" n="Page0251"/>
                <p>We also saw in the negotiating team an apparent bureaucratic division, almost
                    antagonism, within the North Korean government. The chief negotiator for the
                    North Korean side was an engineer, Director Lee, the Director of the Atomic
                    Energy Bureau, a very senior position in the North Korean government. The North
                    Korean Foreign Ministry was represented by a slick looking gentleman with a silk
                    suit, and clearly not held in the highest regard by the people from the Atomic
                    Energy Bureau. He was a quintessential bureaucrat, one of those Foreign Ministry
                    wonks who just get in the way. He would make caustic speeches, mentioning all
                    sorts of inappropriate and tangential points that would cause Wolfe to get
                    impatient and upset. Obviously, Lee could see that this interloper was causing
                    all sorts of trouble in his negotiation. Actually, there were two foreign
                    ministry representatives, a lawyer who kept his mouth shut most of the time and
                    this other, political type. The talkative representative of the Foreign Ministry
                    was kind of chubby, which was also unusual for a Korean. Those from the Atomic
                    Energy Bureau on the negotiating team were rail thin.</p>
                <p>The comparison probably rankled Director Lee. The man in the silk suit would
                    scribble notes all during the negotiations and suddenly rip off a page and pass
                    it to Director Lee. Director Lee was obviously not interested in his scribbled
                    observations, for he would receive the passed notes, hardly look at them, and
                    place them face down on the table beside him. At some time during a break in
                    translation, he would turn up a corner and take a look at the notes and then lay
                    it back face down again. He was doing the absolute minimum to not be completely
                    disrespectful to this person, but certainly not to listen to what he had to say.
                    The man in the silk suit was really upset by this, because he was continually
                    bobbing back and forth in his seat to see what had happened to his brilliant
                    suggestions. You could see him growing visibly ticked off with Lee for not
                    paying attention to his diatribes. It was always the same stuff.</p>
                <p>The failure on our part was that we did not have a competent Korean translator on
                    board who was an American and who would understand what we said, even with the
                    ill-advised legalisms. When Wolfe would use lawyer terms, the translator did not
                    know what he was talking about and would guess. Sometimes Director Lee, whose
                    English was obviously better than he would admit, could straighten things out in
                    his own mind or understood the logical stuff, but many times he could not. This
                    prolonged the negotiations to a considerable extent. Finally, we got to an
                    agreement, although it didn't look like we were going to for a long time. In
                    true North Korean style, they would say “absolutely not, absolutely not,” until
                    three seconds before you break and then they would say, “Well, maybe.”</p>
                <pb facs="0252" n="Page0252"/>
                <p>One last thing. The North Koreans had put together a welcoming banquet which was
                    very elegant at the hotel. The meal was well served, and it was excellent food.
                    To be polite and respectful, we had to reciprocate. A bunch of Americans in the
                    heart of Pyongyang had few options. We could not have it at the hotel, because
                    the dining rooms were all booked. I took my minders on a field excursion to see
                    if we might find a place suitable for a concluding banquet hosted by the
                    Americans. We ended up in the Diplomatic Club, which is a kind of curious,
                    run-down, end-of-the-road operation across the river in the diplomatic area. I
                    went over to look at the place to see whether or not it could be suitable for
                    our gala affair, but it clearly was not. It was a dump. It didn't smell good,
                    and it was dank and dark. I had visions of eventually spending cold winter
                    nights downing suds at the bar and listening to bad stories from drunk
                    foreigners once we were finally here with the Liaison Office.</p>
                <p>We were ushered into a reception room with plastic flowers. It was really more
                    suited for a funeral parlor than for a banquet. But clearly, we had no choice
                    and would have to make the best of it. After some long negotiations, we finally
                    decided on a menu for the banquet. I asked them to make some changes in the
                    room, to take out some of the junk that was useless like the TV sets, plastic
                    flowers, etc. With a heavy heart filled with trepidation I returned to the Koryu
                    Hotel to break the news to the delegation.</p>
                <p>The upshot was, when we had the meal, although it was a little different than
                    many banquets I had been to, it was fairly good. It was, in fact, quite nice in
                    some ways. They had taken out all of the junk and dressed up their waitresses in
                    the North Korean version of the traditional Hanbok. All appeared dramatically
                    different from the polyester-clad bar hostesses I had seen in the afternoon and
                    even the grim room appeared almost cheery. We were brought in through a side
                    entrance, and did not have to walk through the tawdry bar. The North Korean
                    manager did a nice job. Wolfe was obviously pleased, particularly since the
                    total cost came in under the paltry sum available in the ACDA budget. The party
                    was a success and the American taxpayer did well on that one.</p>
                <p>By offering that kind of convivial banquet reception, the U.S. side neatly tied
                    up the negotiations on an upbeat note. It really made a difference, because the
                    North Koreans, like their South Korean brethren, really like a good time. They
                    like to drink, to pass the glass around, and play little parlor games, like
                    singing, making speeches, toasts, etc. They got very convivial. These were the
                    hard nosed, brittle negotiators of the earlier afternoon who suddenly now were
                    drinking buddies in the evening. I have heard the same story from academicians
                    and others who have traveled in the North or have had relationships with North
                    Koreans. They take off the official mask, set it aside, have a good time, and
                    put the mask back on the next morning.</p>
                <pb facs="0253" n="Page0253"/>
                <p>I found also one of the great lessons of all this was, if you begin to work with
                    the North Koreans and put aside politics, they become very helpful, very warm,
                    and in some ways very candid. It also means that you can begin to make progress
                    where there was none before. Suddenly doors open. Things are not as much of a
                    problem as they were once thought to be. If they trust you, the whole
                    relationship develops and changes and they begin to rely on you in many ways for
                    counsel on what they should do. It becomes a whole different equation.</p>
                <p>Much of our negotiation so far has been handled by people who have no experience
                    in Korea, do not speak the language, and do not know much about Korean history
                    or culture. They go in there with their American eyes and American ears, and
                    they hear things that they think are right and in their terms are correct, but
                    are not the facts based on the way that Koreans see them. In turn, the Koreans
                    believe they have been wronged, or worse insulted, but the Americans think it is
                    obvious and they are simply being stiff. In the classic sense, both sides do not
                    understand what the other one is talking about, so we cannot get agreement. I
                    think that has been the crux of our problem with North Korea all along. By the
                    same token, they have the same problem with the Chinese and Japanese. It is not
                    just us, it is everybody. I think if we had the presence of mind to be able to
                    put together negotiating teams that have the language and the culture background
                    as well as the technical expertise required of the negotiations, we would have
                    much greater success with North Korea.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of other parts of the North Korean experience that I think are
                    interesting. There were a whole host of observations and things, but I'm not
                    sure they are germane to what you are looking for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that you read in the paper about North
                        Korea is the adulation for both Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Did that come
                        through to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Oh, sure. I think over the three times I was there, the whole situation
                    changed. I was there in the beginning when there was still the mourning period
                    of Kim Il Sung's death. In the parade given in celebration of the 50th
                    anniversary of the Party, for example, Kim Il Sung was at the center, the son
                    was not. Kim Jong Il was mentioned occasionally, and each time, you had a star
                    that would be shown. He is called the star of Paektu San, the sacred mountain up
                    on the border with China where Korean civilization traditionally came from.
                    There is some controversy about that. As a matter of fact, it is known that Kim
                    Jong Il was not born on the flanks of Paektu San but near Khabarovsk when his
                    parents were living there. None the less, everywhere you go in Korea, there are
                    portraits and squares commemorating Kim Il Sung and to some extent, too, Kim
                    Jong Il, his son, but his son was clearly a secondary deity. In each government
                    building, they would have portraits of the president, vice president, and
                    council somewhere on the wall. What they would have in the foyer was usually a
                    slogan or something said by Kim Il Sung, or Kim Jong Il, for that matter. When
                    one or the other visited a facility, they would take a quote from the visit and
                    carve it on the wall. This is hallowed ground to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0254" n="Page0254"/>
                <p>Engineers are pragmatic, and it is often bone chillingly cold, so they want to
                    get their work done as quickly as possible. We had a shipment driven in from a
                    port, and they tore it apart getting out tools and equipment. The spent-fuel
                    pool room was getting pretty dense with packing material and equipment, but the
                    space in the foyer was empty. So the Americans put down saw horses and began to
                    disassemble the shipment in the foyer until Chief Engineer Lee, suddenly spotted
                    this and exploded. I was in one of the back rooms and was called out. He
                    demanded, “Do you know what is going on out front?” “No,” I responded in
                    surprise and promised to take a look immediately. Of course, they had the whole
                    place covered with trash and equipment was all over the place. He said, “I want
                    you all to understand [meaning us Americans and engineers] that this is an
                    important place to us and the actions of the American engineers is very, very
                    rude. Furthermore, the canning work will not continue until this is straightened
                    out.” We had offended their sensibilities. This was like running around without
                    a shirt or pants in church.</p>
                <p>Taking the lesson to heart, the American engineers got the place even cleaner
                    after they finished than it was before they started. To their credit, the
                    engineers understood the problem and were helpful in cleaning the place up, even
                    giving the North Koreans wide tape to tape down wires and make the place look
                    better than ever. The North Koreans got over their pique, accepted the apology,
                    and allowed work to resume without apparent grudge.</p>
                <p>At another time, we had a crisis of a different sort. We brought in equipment,
                    and it was cold, the winter was coming on, and there wasn't any heat in the
                    building. Once the reactor was shut down, there was no hot water, and with no
                    hot water, there was no heat. The reactor even had been used to heat the entire
                    community. So we had to bring in kerosene heaters for the offices where we did
                    the water chemistry and another room that was a sort of commons for the American
                    crews. It was really cold. You haven't really felt cold until you have had to
                    sit in a concrete building in a very cold place for a very long time. Then you
                    feel a depth of cold that reaches into your bones. The engineers had put in an
                    emergency request for space heaters. In good government fashion, the request was
                    put out for the low bid, and after purchase, the new kerosene heaters were air
                    shipped over.</p>
                <pb facs="0255" n="Page0255"/>
                <p>They were fine and serviceable heaters, but they were made in South Korea. Labels
                    on the boxes and on the heaters said “Made in Korea.” As soon as we got them out
                    of the packing crates and put them on the floor in the boxes, all the North
                    Koreans disappeared. I got called in again by Chief Engineer Lee and asked him
                    what was the problem. He said, “The problem is, we will not work with those
                    boxes in our building. Burn them, destroy them, but get rid of them. And the
                    heaters as well.” I was alarmed. “But we need them; it is cold.” We finally
                    arrived at the conclusion that the offence was the “Made in Korea” labels. So we
                    got our jackknives out and went out and cut out of the boxes all of the stamps
                    that said “Made in Korea.” We took the stuff out and scraped off all the little
                    “Made in Korea” decals. We examined everything scrupulously to make sure nothing
                    said “Made in Korea.” I went back to the Chief Engineer and said, “I think we
                    have solved the problem. Won't you come out and look?” He went out to look and
                    found nothing with the offending “Made in Korea” labels, so all was now
                    acceptable and we got our heat. The fact they had been made in South Korea was
                    not the important thing. It was the fact that they said “Made in Korea,” to them
                    taunting our North Korean co-workers.</p>
                <p>The same thing happened when the first shipment of rice aid arrived in the
                    northern port. Remember when the North Koreans became exercised over the South
                    Korean flag flying on the back of the ship? That was the same syndrome, only
                    written in a different size. The North Koreans were extremely sensitive to that.
                    Whenever we would drive by car through the center of the nuclear compound of
                    Nyongbyon, like in the city of Pyongyang, there was a Kim Il Sung square with
                    his portrait on a billboard as the centerpiece. All cars were expected to slow
                    down and go at a crawl in front of the portrait. You could then speed up (even
                    when crossing in front of the portrait of Kim Jong Il) to continue along to the
                    next check point. That occurred almost everywhere we traveled. It resembles a
                    religion rather than politics or political control. And if you begin to think of
                    it as a religion, you may not become a believer, but you can at least understand
                    it as a religion and then much of what they do becomes understandable.</p>
                <p>Kim Il Sung was seen to be a man but revered as a god. Everybody knew he was not
                    god, but nonetheless, he became the symbol of the state, the central image
                    around which the identity of the nation is built. Wherever you traveled around
                    North Korea, there are plaques, pictures, and commemoration tablets that are
                    standing where Kim Il Sung visited and gave “guidance” to the workers of the
                    time. You can laugh at that, but like a good ward politician, he visited every
                    little hamlet in the country. Everywhere you go, there is a plaque where Kim Il
                    Sung stood and gave advice to the farmers or to the workers or the citizens.
                    Wherever he made a pronouncement, there is a picture. There is a wealth of
                    paintings of Kim Il Sung. It is a religion with its own myths and faiths. The
                    images and portraits are the icons of the religion. There is a book of his
                    writings that the believers can cling to. Now, of course, he is dead, and there
                    is the ethereal part of the religion. The son has not, to date, been able to
                    assume the same level of divinity.</p>
                <pb facs="0256" n="Page0256"/>
                <p>I had the chance to watch a fair amount of North Korean television on my several
                    trips north. Since there was not much else to do at the guest house once you
                    tired of pool, it was possible to watch North Korean television. Based on the
                    number of programs I saw, the North Koreans like to show soap opera type
                    programs. This is done all over the world to much the same rapt attention. At
                    least that was the habit of the guest house staff who watched the stories on the
                    one set on the lower floor in the lobby. The most common plot line was usually
                    stories of some hero defending the faith of the party or following the guidance
                    of Kim Il Sung. In fact, they are interpersonal fights, melodramas. We used to
                    enjoy movies with a girl tied up on the tracks, and a speeding train is on the
                    way while a man in a black hat stands by, twirling a handle bar mustache. It is
                    the same stuff all over again. We went through that in the '30s and '40s. They
                    have their villains and usually they are rightists, or something like that.
                    There is still the black hat and mustache and the girl tied up on the tracks. It
                    is the same story. The hero has muscles and the chiseled jaw like we used to
                    have. The same stuff. That is what they watch and enjoy. The news shows and
                    documentaries generated only boredom until the next drama.</p>
                <p>Like all people, if the North Koreans are given a chance to enjoy something
                    different or exotic, they usually take it. An example of this is taped music
                    played in the cars. Most North Korean music is written in North Korea, of
                    course, with generous nods to themes that coincidentally may have appeared in
                    familiar western music. However, if you are in a car with a driver who got sick
                    of the same stuff all the time, what he plays is tapes which are essentially
                    Western music done by North Korean orchestras. That is acceptable, I guess,
                    because they would have Western music which you couldn't recognize or thought it
                    sounded vaguely familiar but different. Nonetheless, it sounded a lot like what
                    we would recognize as Western classical music. They have a light band which
                    plays on television all the time. They get singers and sing folk songs and
                    things like that. So there is some variety. I bought some of the music. Some of
                    it is very good; Koreans love to sing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. The South Koreans took to what we could call
                        Western classical music like ducks to water.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Northerners have many of the same musical traits as their southern
                    brothers. For example, they like opera. You would have baritones and bass
                    singers on television all the time, singing their hearts out. The audience will
                    sing along with them in the concerts. The camera will turn on the audience, and
                    there everyone is singing in the audience too. So you obviously do not go to
                    concerts to listen, you go to participate. You do the same thing in the South.

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself, with a Korean born wife, etc., as a
                        source of information about North Korea? Were you playing this role when you
                        got back, unofficially, not officially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: To some extent yes. Officially, too. I spoke to at least one Korean think
                    tank on the subject of North Korea. I took back a videotape. One of the
                    engineers was a camera buff, and he had a video camera with him. When we went to
                    the 50th anniversary show in Pyongyang, he took his camera and lots of tape. He
                    taped for hours, just about the whole thing. So he has most of the parade on
                    tape. In fact, he is selling it now on the Internet for $30 a copy or something
                    like that. I took this tape with me and showed it at one of the Korean think
                    tanks for a very conservative group of Korean commentators. I got a lot of
                    skepticism on their part about what I had seen. A lot of disbelief by some of
                    them. Others, not so much.I think most Koreans now believe that unification is
                    going to be a slow process, and they actually support that. The cost of
                    unification in the short run will be so much that it would cripple the southern
                    economy, and they don't want to give up their own benefits of the good life,
                    even though they recognize the North needs additional food, especially, and a
                    lot of investment. I believe that the question of the amount of investment that
                    would be needed in North Korea can be a bit overblown. American scholars have
                    made many of the estimates on the cost of unification, perhaps based loosely on
                    the German experience. I went to a conference in Seoul on this question, and we
                    had a number of American economists and political scientists who stood up and
                    started quoting numbers in the billions of dollars as what would be required.
                    There was not much direct explanation of how they got those numbers, but they
                    talked about the necessity of almost a trillion dollars in investments. The
                    southern Korean economy doesn't have that kind of money.</p>
                <p>Their point was that, even in Germany when the unification was accomplished with
                    a lot more on the ground investment in the East, the Germans were shocked to
                    find out how much it cost to accomplish reunification and try to bring the East
                    up to some standard that could be acceptable and compatible with the western
                    economy. Their point was that the Korean experience would be more expensive,
                    because the disparity between the two countries is much greater. And that is
                    probably true, although I think it underestimates the ability of the northerners
                    to hang in there longer to get their physical requirements met like food and
                    shelter and education. There is a possibility that the larger investment won't
                    be as high, because I think their expectations are lower and will continue to
                    be, despite a closer relationship with the south.</p>

                <p>YATES: They have taken a lot. They talk about a famine in the north. It is a
                    famine, but they have had some degree of famine for forty years. It is clear
                    that the communist system they have does not work. There are numerous instances
                    around the world of economic failure in communist systems. This is the last of
                    the breed. They know what failure is. The problem is, will they be able to
                    accept the consequences of that failure in the face of the obvious luxury and
                    wealth of the south at the same time. If the barriers are dropped, what will
                    they do?</p>
                <p>The southerners expect them to enter into a mass migration south for jobs. In
                    fact, the South is importing labor now for some of the menial jobs they no
                    longer wish to fill themselves. This is the same kind of thing the Germans had
                    experienced. The question is, would the northerners take these jobs from the
                    foreigners the South were bringing in. Would the southerners also be able to
                    provide the indicated labor force needed for the kind of industries southerners
                    no longer do, like shoes. The south has already moved a lot of its manufacturing
                    base offshore. The investment that went into Korea in the late sixties and early
                    seventies, textile manufacture, shoe manufacture and things like that, are no
                    longer in Korea. Now they are going high tech and much of the stuff they did
                    before has gone off to China or down to Malaysia or Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself being used by the North Koreans
                        because you would be the only one who knew South Korea in this group? Were
                        you feeding their curiosity about South Korea or were they pretty
                        careful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: They were pretty careful. I think they don't want to talk about it,
                    because that would easily corrupt them in the eyes of their own system.
                    Generally speaking, they did not talk about it much. After a while when you got
                    to know people, you began to get a little bit more of that. You had to be very
                    careful, because if you tried to push it, then they would push you out. So you
                    did not bring it up. If they wanted to talk about it, you would be happy to do
                    so. But you had to be careful. If they wanted to talk about it, they were
                    probably baiting you or something akin to the games the Chinese intelligence
                    service played. But if you backed off a little bit and took a quiet road, I
                    think you built more confidence among them.I had a lot of political discussions
                    with my North Korean handlers. In the beginning, they would all give speeches,
                    particularly if a superior was within earshot. If you ride in a car with one of
                    their superiors next to you, the guide in front would launch into a long tirade
                    against American inequities and the duplicity and colonization of the South,
                    etc. They would get tiresome. More than once, I had this happen to me, but not
                    with the same person more than once. Once they had done it, that seemed to
                    complete a check box in the report they had to file on you. Once you are past
                    that, particularly if you are willing to buy the beer or cigarettes, they are
                    willing to sit down and talk about other things. I had a long conversation once
                    about the American civil war, which North Koreans have virtually no knowledge
                    of.</p>
                <pb facs="0259" n="Page0259"/>
                <p>The guides that we got were not political types; they were technical people. It
                    was a strange thing. Political types never studied English, technical types did,
                    because it was a language that allowed you to learn about something technical
                    like nuclear energy or math. A lot of information on nuclear energy is in
                    English or German. So they had linguistic talents but were chemists, physicists
                    or mathematicians. There was one of the guides who was a mathematician
                    interested in a wider range of things. One day, we got talking about the Korean
                    war. I mentioned the U.S. also had had a civil war at one time between the North
                    and the South. He seemed interested and curious, with a wish to know more about
                    it. I suggested that he read The Red Badge of Courage to get an idea of some of
                    the feelings of Americans on the front lines during the civil war.</p>
                <p>Steven Crane's seminal work was the first time that war as a terrible thing got
                    into the literature. To Crane, it was not a noble cause but an intensely
                    personal experience that called into question many things otherwise assumed. War
                    not as a valiant thing, as it was portrayed in the North very often. The war on
                    a personal level and how much it cost people, the wounded, and the suffering
                    that was brought about by the war. It would also give the Northerners an
                    understanding of how the suffering occurred in the South as well and how much
                    people there suffered because of the war. It wasn't any longer a question of
                    which side you were on, it was a question of the effect of the war that was the
                    same on both sides. So I suggested he get the book. He said he could not get it
                    and asked if I could give him a copy. I promised I would and in fact took a copy
                    with me back to North Korea the next time but unfortunately never had an
                    opportune time to give it to him. I could not put him in the position of
                    accepting it.</p>
                <p>USIA had put together 5,000 volumes, each in North Korean style Korean. We had it
                    specially translated and printed in the Philippines, ready in Seoul to go north
                    with me. Each time I would go north, I would take some volumes with me to leave
                    around if I could. I could not leave them in Nyongbyon, because it was against
                    the rules and would have caused trouble for everybody. But I did leave them in
                    Pyongyang with the Swedish representative to give to people who he thought would
                    know about them and understand them and would be able to accept them without
                    causing political difficulties.</p>
                <p>I had a long discussion once with one of our guides' bosses in Pyongyang about
                    the American Congress. At that time, Congress was really in an anti-North Korean
                    mood. Part of the reason was that the North Koreans had denied a visa to Rep.
                    Jay Kim who was an ethnic Korean in the U.S. Congress from California and who
                    had applied to visit North Korea. He was turned down by the North Koreans as, I
                    guess, a person they did not want to see. My point to them was that not granting
                    a visa was a foolish move, because the very person who they could have counted
                    on to have a better understanding of what went on here was kept out. And that
                    was not a good idea. This very educated, very astute, and relatively speaking,
                    well-read man, had no idea who Jay Kim was. The problem for me as a USIS person
                    was, here was an obvious example where a little knowledge would have helped a
                    very difficult situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0260" n="Page0260"/>
                <p>I think in the U.S. we see the North Koreans as monolithic. That somehow the
                    knowledge that one has, everybody has. In fact, they are very badly divided in
                    terms of being super compartmentalized. I mentioned before the division between
                    the public energy bureau and the foreign ministry. This is true throughout their
                    society. It is true in China. You give something to one man in the Foreign
                    Ministry in Beijing, and the person at the next desk likely will never see it.
                    We ran into this in Bejing, trying to get our Wireless Files into the Foreign
                    Ministry. You would talk to one man, and he would say, “I would like to see
                    those.” “Gee, we give them to so-and-so who is in your same section.” He says,
                    “That is his copy; I don't see it.”</p>
                <p>In China, as in most places, information is power. So if you go to a meeting and
                    say, “I know what the Americans said,” and the other guy did not, who gets the
                    leg up in the Foreign Ministry? It becomes one of these internal rivalry things.
                    Chinese just do not pass messages around very easily. North Korea is the same
                    way. That means you have to get people who trust you in each of these areas;
                    otherwise you may have the trust of one segment on one side, but two desks over,
                    the bureaucrat thinks you are dirt, because he does not have any idea who you
                    are or what you do.</p>
                <p>That is why it was so important for us to have a liaison office in Pyongyang. We
                    can talk until we are blue in the face about our trust and agreements and the
                    fact that the North Koreans did renege on there agreement to cross the border,
                    that is absolutely true. But the fact is, we would have gained far more in the
                    placement of a Liaison Office in Pyongyang than North Korea would have gained by
                    the placement of a Liaison Office in Washington. There is be no comparison,
                    because the systems are so dissimilar. It would have been important for them to
                    learn more than it would have been important for them to instruct more. In terms
                    of Pyongyang, the reverse was true. It would be an important learning point for
                    us, but by far it would have been an opening to the society in creating
                    understanding who Americans are and what their intentions are in the world. Now,
                    it is ignorance that dominates things. Gradually, as the North Koreans move
                    around and learn more, this will change, but it will take a lot of patience and
                    time.</p>
                <p>A couple of years back, the first North Korean delegation went to Hawaii to
                    CINCPAC to talk about the recovery of remains. That I think was badly mishandled
                    on our side, because we took it as a negotiation instead of what it should have
                    been, an explanation. A similar event had occurred with the Chinese before. I
                    had taken it on as a personal crusade to push that because the Chinese had come
                    to CINCPAC while I was there. Using civilian clothes, military Chinese took a
                    look at our remains identification laboratory, which is called CILHI (Central
                    Identification Laboratory, Hawaii), and is located at Travis Air Force Base
                    where all remains from all deceased veterans who are exhumed around the world
                    are brought for DNA testing and whatever positive identification can be made.
                    The North Koreans had a very simplified view of that, as did the Chinese. We
                    brought the Chinese in quietly, no press, no negotiations, but just come as
                    guests and stay in a hotel and be shown what we are doing. We were not asking
                    for any promises or favors. We wanted them to just come and understand.</p>
                <pb facs="0261" n="Page0261"/>
                <p>When that was done with the Chinese, it had marvelous consequences. We got the
                    first American military teams into China to recovery sites in southern China
                    where pilots from Vietnam had crashed. We wanted to investigate those sites and
                    were able to do so in a way that was scientifically sustainable. We could send
                    teams in, working with the Chinese and look at sites at a fair price and exhume
                    the remains where they could be found. We had controlled the situation, so that
                    we had firm assurances for the families back here that those remains were in
                    fact their son, father, uncle, etc. and they could be assured of this when they
                    had that casket back home and in the ground. In North Korea, we didn't get any
                    of that, because the North Koreans came as negotiators, not as tourists as it
                    were, and the effort failed. They tried to do it again in New York a couple of
                    weeks ago, and we made, I guess, some little progress, but it hasn't gone very
                    far. Had we gotten off our political stump and just stood down and said, “You
                    come, you look, that is all we are asking,” then we probably would have been a
                    lot further down the line in North Korea than we are now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who else was going in with the team when you weren't
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: They were people who were in Seoul with me. The exception was Spence
                    Richardson who only went in once. Since he was the named head of the new Liaison
                    Office, it was felt that having him go more would send the wrong signal. But for
                    those of us worker bees, it was not so important.</p>
                <p>Also, they took people out of Washington. The Department of Energy people would
                    go at times. If you had a diplomatic passport, you could go. That was not a very
                    good policy, because that meant people going in didn't have Korean and there
                    were some incidents that happened in North Korea that could have been avoided if
                    they had understood a little more Korean. We had an incident where third country
                    people got involved with some engineer, and we had to expel that engineer from
                    North Korea. We sent him out, not the North Koreans. The North Koreans in their
                    humanistic fashion were very sorry. Subsequent to the expulsion, I got an ear
                    full after I got there. One engineer had a fight with one of the guides. Nobody
                    got hurt, but there were blows exchanged and a lot of irate words. He was
                    immediately sent home. He was a good engineer, a welder. These guys were
                    technicians. He was a good welder, a fabricator from somewhere in North
                    Carolina. Not a bad person. But he was sent home and never went back, and the
                    reason was because he got into a fight with one of the guides.</p>
                <pb facs="0262" n="Page0262"/>
                <p>What had happened was they went to the Diplomatic Club I mentioned earlier and
                    started drinking. There were a bunch of third world people off to the side,
                    Cubans, I am told. They began to egg him on. He evidently was having a political
                    discussion with one of the guides, which happened now and then. The guides were
                    drinking also. They never said no to a good cold beer. Nobody was really drunk,
                    but he had a lot. Evidently from the side, these guys were egging him on. “Why
                    are you taking this stuff? I thought you were a strong American.” It just built
                    up until he got into a real fight. I guess egos were hurt more than bodies, but
                    we had to send him on the next airplane out and he never came back.</p>
                <p>When I went up to Pyongyang later, the North Koreans asked why he was not coming
                    back. They professed to have liked him. They wanted me to understand that they
                    had not asked to have him expelled. They understood that he had done the wrong
                    thing but did not want to see him hurt. They kept saying this again and again
                    until I finally said, “Enough already, I understand, but he is not coming back.
                    You only get one chance in this environment, and we are trying to be careful.”
                    We have always tried very carefully to put across to the North Koreans how much
                    we were being super careful about their feelings. That they should let us know
                    when there are any problems, so we could straighten things out. They liked that
                    and took that as a mark of respect.</p>
                <p>Another little vignette. We had trouble with the guards coming in and out of the
                    check points. They were surly, mean, and abusive. On my first trip in, I was
                    riding in the back seat with one of the engineers, a deputy who was in charge of
                    the engineering group. He had his feet crossed in the back seat, one foot up on
                    his knee. Going through, he was supposed to be in the back of the car leaning
                    back. We had to wait and wait and wait while these guys went around the car. A
                    guard reached in and slapped his foot off his knee onto the floor. The shocked
                    engineer turned to me, “What did I do?” The reason was clear: the guard took
                    that as a sign of disrespect for authority. He got a dirty look through the
                    window and an admonition not to do that again. And off we went. He was suitably
                    upset about it, but we got him calmed down then.</p>
                <p>We then started a series of culture lectures for the engineers on Sundays. I gave
                    a condensed version of Korean 101 on culture. What to do and what not to do. For
                    example, when you pass something to someone, you always pass it with the right
                    hand, never use your left hand. The guards always passed back the visas with
                    their left hand, because they were showing us an indication of disrespect or
                    their superior authority. The correct way is to use both hands, but if you can't
                    quite reach, you take one hand and put it under your elbow and pass it with the
                    right hand. That is correct. If you cannot do it that way, you get up and walk
                    around until you can. You never toss things across the table. If you are having
                    a meeting, get up, walk around, and pass things with the right hand, although
                    both hands is the best and most respectful way to do it. Never keep your bags,
                    computers, paraphernalia on the table. Put them on the floor out of sight. Never
                    put your feet on the table. All these little rules were things that were
                    necessary in Korean culture.</p>
                <pb facs="0263" n="Page0263"/>
                <p>We got the engineers starting to do this, particularly with the guards going in
                    and out at the check points. Regardless of how they pass it to you, always pass
                    it back with your right hand. We started doing this. It caused some confusion
                    among the guards going in. First off, it was interesting psychology. If you were
                    doing something polite and somebody did something rude, who is wrong? They know.
                    If you keep doing this, always being polite and nice to them while they are
                    being nasty to you, no longer is it a matter of authority over the barbarians;
                    now they are doing something that they recognize as being culturally correct,
                    but their own actions do not warrant that. When confronted with a biblical
                    turning of the cheek, who is on the defensive?</p>
                <p>The guards became confused. The more intelligent or older guards began to be
                    polite, using the right hand to pass things back and forth, too. The older ones,
                    who had been there for a while, began to let people through without stopping. I
                    would get this at lunch time, going back and forth to the house. Very often,
                    they would just wave me through. They became very comfortable with us after a
                    while, because we began to show them a little bit of respect, and they could no
                    longer use the mechanisms of disrespect, because the stupid Americans would not
                    know any better anyway. Now that the Americans did know better, they were now in
                    the wrong in their own cultural terms and that made it very difficult for them
                    to continue the practice. Only the new guards, the ones who did not know you,
                    would do the arrogant left-handed affront. A mutual respect began to grow and we
                    had far less trouble. The same was true in the pool area. I taught the engineers
                    enough phrases in Korean like daily greetings, which they would try to use.
                    There would be a great guffaw, because the intrepid Americans from the south
                    always seemed to find a way to mispronounce them. What the linguistic forays
                    did, was to disarm the hard feelings and bring out a relaxed hospitality in the
                    pool area to the point where they began to really work with each other at a much
                    more personal level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the program continue the whole time without basic
                        interruptions during your time there, despite disturbances along the border,
                        etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>YATES: Yes, but a qualified yes. The North Koreans did not want the program to
                    stop. It was a small source of income. We were helping them, giving them a lot
                    of equipment and material such as stainless steel canisters. Their point was
                    that they had given everything. They had given up the reactor, and the people in
                    the city of Nyongbyon went cold in the winter, because there was no heat. They
                    did all the sacrificing; we did nothing. There were a lot of things that we did
                    that were wrong. There were mistakes in the negotiations, primarily because of
                    language, but also because we did this at lower levels which were not always the
                    best informed or experienced negotiators.</p>
                <pb facs="0264" n="Page0264"/>
                <p>For example, we had agreed to provide a generator and heat exchanger for the
                    North Koreans, a boiler essentially, so they could make enough hot water to
                    supply the nuclear site, pre-heat the heavy fuel oil to be burned in a converted
                    coal plant so as to put hot water back into the system, and to allow the city to
                    get some heat and heat for the site. We promised a boiler to burn heavy fuel oil
                    in 45 days. The U.S. negotiator, for some reason, thought this was easy. They
                    could just buy one on the west coast and ship it out, and it would be there in
                    two weeks. What he didn't understand is that heavy fuel oil isn't burned in the
                    U.S. anymore. It is an older form of fuel and the only place that we had
                    existing heavy fuel oil burning capability was in the old LSTs that were
                    decommissioned. So we had to find a place where we could get one. It meant we
                    had to buy a design and build it. We had the technology, but it was an old
                    technology. Sort of like going to Singer Sewing Machine for a peddle machine.
                    They would build one, but it would be expensive. It took more than a year to get
                    that boiler, a simple teakettle arrangement that could warm heavy oil so that
                    it, in turn, could provide heat for homes in North Korea.</p>
                <p>The North Koreans took that as a sign of either disrespect or ignorance or
                    foolishness. We couldn't deliver what we promised. It would come up every
                    morning at a conference before work. The meeting would start and the first thing
                    Chief Engineer Lee would say would be, “Where is the boiler?” He was cold, and
                    his people were cold, and he wanted that boiler there. We brought in kerosine
                    heaters which were all right, but they needed that boiler to provide the hot
                    water heat that was necessary for their living quarters. It wasn't expensive,
                    but it made us look pretty much like fools.</p>
                <p>The second thing was how do you get the heavy oil there? The stuff freezes. Heavy
                    oil is like tar. If it gets cold, it gets solid, so that the trucks that were to
                    haul the stuff had to be heated. They wanted a heated truck. We said, “No, no,
                    we only promised you a boiler, we are not going to give you a heated truck.”
                    “How are we going to get the fuel from there to here?” They had preheating
                    tanks, called day tanks, where you keep the fuel before you put it into the
                    boiler. They were having trouble with the technology of converting boilers for
                    regular oil to heavy fuel oil. You can't start a boiler with heavy fuel; you
                    have to start it with something else like kerosene in order to get the fire
                    burning, with which you can heat the oil and start the flow and burn the heavy
                    oil. That technology was something they didn't have. Making that conversion was
                    a major stumbling block for them, because we weren't providing it. All we were
                    providing was the heavy fuel oil at the port.</p>
                <pb facs="0265" n="Page0265"/>
                <p>From my point of view, some of the things that we were doing might be called
                    unreasonable. They tried to accommodate us in some things, but in some cases,
                    they could not, and they would start making speeches. They didn't know enough
                    about us to come to us and say “Look, this is our problem and let's see if we
                    can find a solution to this.” Their solution was to pound the table and make
                    noise, because they felt that was the only way they could negotiate something.
                    Our lack of understanding made these negotiations stretch out far beyond their
                    normal life expectancy. So we did it to ourselves. Not that the North Koreans
                    are wonderful, holy, kind, generous, thrifty; they were nasty at times and would
                    do some terrible things abroad, but their Achilles heel is in the negotiating
                    sense; they are Koreans and their basic instincts are reasonableness,
                    hospitality, but above all intense loyalty to their own system. If we assumed
                    that at the start of the negotiations, we would have saved ourselves a lot of
                    grief.</p>
