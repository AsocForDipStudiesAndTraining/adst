                <p>JOHN R. ERIKSSON</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: W. Haven North </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 17, 1995</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is April 17, 1995. The interview is with John R.
                        Eriksson who retired from USAID in February 1995. He has been with USAID for
                        25 years. Let's start out with some early history; a little bit about your
                        family background, where you came from, your education, particularly as they
                        relate to how you got into the world of international development.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early history, family and education</p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. My family had been mid-
                    westerners in Michigan through the generations which don't go back very far
                    because they came from Nordic countries; my father's parents were Swedish and my
                    mother was born in Finland. From the upper peninsula to Detroit, my father was
                    an educator with the Board of Education.</p>
                <p>How did I get interested in international development?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you get to that point, talk about the earlier days:
                        where you went to school....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, there is a link back to those days. I just read an article by
                    Keith Richburg, Washington Post correspondent in Nairobi. It turns out that
                    Richburg was born and raised in Detroit. Echoing my childhood reflections,
                    Richburg said that being from the mid-west and a long distance from oceans gave
                    international travel a certain attraction and mystery for him.</p>
                <p>However, my childhood career interest in electronics led to graduation from a
                    technical high school and a beginning major in electrical engineering at Wayne
                    State University in Detroit. As an undergrad at Wayne State I was exposed to the
                    whole range of the liberal arts. This experience, together with memories of my
                    recently deceased father and his strong interest in peace and social justice
                    issues, combined to convince me that I wanted to be something other than an
                    electrical engineer.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize his views about social
                        justice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: He was very much a New Deal Democrat; although I think my father
                    supported World War II, he was opposed to elements of US Cold War foreign
                    policy. I recall he was critical of John Foster Dulles and felt that Senator Joe
                    McCarthy posed a grave threat to world peace. It was also that background that
                    motivated my change, including remembering long discussions on peace and justice
                    issues my father would have with close friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That influenced you to make the shift in education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's right; the shift to economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you pick economics over other subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Several professors convinced me that economics dealt with important
                    issues of society. So, after an undergraduate degree with a major in philosophy
                    and a minor in economics, I went on for a Masters in Economics at Wayne State
                    University with a minor in Industrial and Labor Relations. At that point my
                    objective was to work in the field of industrial relations for one of the big
                    three auto companies in Detroit. But my thesis advisor at Wayne State encouraged
                    me to continue on for a Ph.D. So I applied and was accepted as a Ph.D.
                    candidate, with a graduate research assistantship at the University of
                    California at Berkeley. As a research assistant I worked for the Chairman of the
                    University of California Institute for Industrial Relations, Dr. Arthur Ross,
                    who had just completed a book on international comparisons in industrial
                    conflict. Dr. Ross asked me to develop an annotated bibliography for everything
                    I could get my hands on regarding labor relations and industrial conflict in
                    Latin America. That got me “hooked” on development and resulted in my
                    specializing in development economics as well as labor economics for my
                    Ph.D.</p>
                <p>Research work in Latin America and labor economics</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your thesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was a comparative study of wage structures in economic development
                    in seven Latin American countries. My wife and I spent seven months in the seven
                    countries while I conducted field research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Mexico, Venezuela , Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much sense of the situation in those
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Having never been out of the US before, except across the Detroit River
                    to Canada, it was a totally new experience for us. We experienced a lot during
                    those seven months. We had exposures to the great contrasts between wealth and
                    poverty in Latin American countries, to their fascinating cultures and
                    histories, to their politics, and to some of the personal stresses and ailments
                    that all foreign service officers experience. For example, at one point in
                    Bogota, Colombia, we were marooned in a dingy room of the ninth floor of a
                    shabby hotel with no lights or power, while violent demonstrations and bombings
                    raged in the streets below.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the middle of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: We were in the middle of it. But that didn't stop us from taking every
                    opportunity we could, especially on the weekends, to get out into the rural
                    hinterlands. In Lima, Peru, for example, we took the Central Railroad (the
                    Ferrocarril Central) up to the highest Andean pass, at 11,000 feet above sea
                    level, to an Indian village. Experiences of that nature whetted our appetite and
                    reinforced our interest in development.</p>
                <p>On completion of my work at Berkeley, I was offered two opportunities to go into
                    academia.</p>
                <p>Teaching at Williams College and the Center for Development Economics</p>
                <p>Although I didn't exclude the possibility of doing other kinds of things, I was
                    advised - and still think it was good advice - to have a stint in academia first
                    before doing something else. My offers were “apple and orange” in nature: one at
                    Williams College in Massachusetts and one at UCLA (University of California at
                    Los Angeles). I took the “apple” rather than the “orange” and went to Williams
                    for several reasons: it had an excellent reputation for quality; it was a
                    relatively small school; and its location was in a part of the country we had
                    not experienced before. However, the main attraction was that it had a “Center
                    for Development Economics” that had been established a few years previously with
                    a major grant from the Ford Foundation. The Center enrolls about 25 students
                    from developing countries for an intensive one-year Masters Degree program.
                    Students are handpicked, with a balance among the major developing regions. Many
                    graduates of the Williams program have risen to senior positions. For example,
                    one of my students is now the Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were teaching as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I taught both at the Center for Development Economics and in the
                    regular undergraduate economics program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: General courses or something special?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The gamut: Principles of Economics, Macro and Micro Theory, Labor
                    Economics, Development Economics and Latin American Economic Development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do any additional research or writings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, some. I published some articles after finishing my dissertation,
                    and performed some USAID funded research in Argentina . In 1967 my wife and I
                    spent the entire summer in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I did research on
                    export promotion and policies. We experienced a coup in Argentina that summer,
                    complete with gun emplacements on the lawn of the Casa Rosada, the home of the
                    Argentine President, right around the corner from our hotel. Even though the
                    government was by no means democratic then, it had not reached the depth of the
                    horrors that occurred in Argentina in subsequent years. Nonetheless, we still
                    have a fond spot in our hearts for Argentina. But its history is tragic; it
                    could have been a “developed” country a long time before now. But as the result
                    in particular of the disastrous polices of the dictator, Juan Peron , of the
                    forties and '50s, the whole country was put “on hold,” even retrogressed, for
                    decades. Argentina was also of special interest in my dissertation because
                    government policies focused explicitly on wage structure. Peron deliberately
                    tried to compress wage structure to boost the wages of unskilled workers, who
                    were one of his main pillars of political support, and to keep a ceiling on the
                    wages of skilled workers. That policy had distorting effects on the allocative
                    mechanisms of Argentine labor markets and on skill formation in the country.
                    [See article, “Wage Policy and Economic Development in Latin American
                    Countries,” cited as first entry in Bibliography at end of Oral History.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave the Williams College experience, you said
                        you had a student who became Prime Minister of Singapore. Do you have any
                        impressions of the person at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Goh Chok Tong was a good, serious student, considered number one or two
                    in the class. He was articulate and active in class discussions. After joining
                    USAID, I attended a conference in Singapore in June 1971 and had lunch with Goh,
                    who was already Director of the Singapore Shipping Corporation. One could sense
                    that even bigger and better things were in store for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other students that you particularly
                        recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, one of my students, Eduardo Rosas , became the head of the
                    National Planning Office in Colombia. Another, Aris Othman , is now the Deputy
                    Permanent Secretary for Policy, right behind the Minister and the Permanent
                    Secretary, in the Malaysian Ministry of Finance. We “baby sat” for each others'
                    kids in Williamstown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It interesting to think about people who have become of
                        special note; it nice to get a flavor of their earlier periods.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, one of the great things about my six years at Williams was that I
                    would keep running into former students after joining USAID. Now it is getting a
                    little more difficult, but, especially in my early years at USAID, when I would
                    go on TDY to almost any country, one of the first things I would do would be to
                    see a former student who would then often help me with contacts and extend
                    hospitality at his or her home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Williams program have any particular viewpoint
                        about the development business? Was it just a general studies program or did
                        it have a particular philosophy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was pretty technocratic, that is, with great emphasis on analytical
                    skills and applying them to policy problems, based on a sound understanding of
                    economic principles, stressing the importance of market mechanisms, and
                    offsetting or preferably eliminating the distorting influence of government
                    policies. However, I understand that the Williams program has in recent years
                    placed more emphasis on such issues as democracy and governance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of attitude did they have about social
                        development and such aspects of economic growth? Did they have much feel for
                        that? Or was it pretty classical economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: As I look back on it, I would say fairly classical and “neo-classical.”
                    There was certainly a recognition of the importance of human resource
                    development, for example; but I don't think they did very much with it, although
                    there was an undergraduate course on human resource economics. One limitation of
                    the Masters Degree program is its one-year length. Consequently, there is little
                    opportunity to branch out into other subject areas, except in the Spring
                    Semester “Term Paper.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about that sabbatical. What was
                        that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I went there to do further research on the relationship between wage
                    policy and employment growth in developing countries. The ILO is like a number
                    of UN agencies: it's a mixed bag; some good work done but a lot of international
                    politics too. I recall how the Soviets manipulated the ILO, how every Soviet
                    national on the staff, including one fellow in the Economic Branch, had as a
                    main responsibility “reporting” back to the Soviet intelligence apparatus. I was
                    also surprised that this was commonly known throughout the rest of the ILO
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much interaction with these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Not much with the Soviet staff, even with the “economist” in my Branch.
                    I did get to know some other staff quite well and developed a high regard them.
                    For example, an Indian economist, Agit Bhalla, made significant contributions to
                    the literature on the economics of choice of technology. And a Czechoslovakian,
                    Felix Paukert, has written extensively on income distribution and employment.
                    There were also some very poignant cases of people at the ILO who were refugees
                    from tragic situations in their own country, such as Paukert, who escaped from
                    the Soviet crackdown on Czechoslovakia. Another fellow whom I first met at the
                    ILO, and subsequently recruited into USAID, is Peter Thormann, who is now the
                    Senior Economist in the Africa Bureau under Jerry Wolgin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that experience in Geneva mean to you and how did
                        it affect you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was my first taste of working in a government bureaucracy, and an
                    opportunity to experience some of the potentials as well as the limitations. On
                    a different level, I would say it was a memorable year for us — living in
                    Geneva, learning some French, and traveling around the region. The experience
                    also provided a valuable exposure to people from a wide range of countries,
                    including many developing countries. It also gave me a taste of being involved
                    in a major international conference: the Biannual International Labor
                    Conference, which was held during our stay in Geneva. Literally everyone on the
                    ILO staff, including me, was pulled out of their on-going assignments to
                    backstop the Conference, which included “being on hand” for the late-night
                    sessions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the ILO then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: David Morse, an American, and highly regarded. I also great respect for
                    my immediate boss, the Director of the Economic Research Branch, Norton
                    Franklin. Franklin was a white South African, but very much against apartheid.
                    He was something of a refugee himself since he refused to go back to South
                    Africa until apartheid policies were dismantled. Those kinds of contacts made
                    quite an impression on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your exposure to Russian tactics give you any insights
                        into cold war matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. It helped prepare me for future encounters. After joining USAID I
                    was asked to represent the US at a UNESCO conference in Paris. When confronted
                    by blatant Soviet tactics to distort the US position, I thought I was able to
                    forcefully correct the distortions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you had that previous experience, and understood
                        what they were about and their tactics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any sense of what they were trying to do with
                        the ILO? What their agenda might have been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: On the surface it appeared that the Soviets were combating an attack by
                    the West, especially by the US, on the facade of the Soviets belonging to the
                    ILO, which is supposed to be a genuine tripartite organization with independent
                    labor, management and government representatives. The US charged that the Soviet
                    representation was illegitimate since it did not include independent employer
                    and employee representatives (i.e., independent from the State). That was not
                    only a point made by the US Government, but more vigorously by the AFL-CIO. I
                    also heard, but without direct evidence, that the Soviets would try to make
                    contacts with ILO staff of other nationalities for intelligence purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were not in the position of having to defend the
                        US policy line?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Not at the ILO.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move on from there and, if you want to come back to
                        it, you can later. You have essentially finished with your time at Williams
                        College. Why did you leave Williams?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>An invitation to USAID: Program and Policy Bureau in 1970s</p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's a good question. I didn't feel that I was all that successful as
                    a teacher. I never seemed to get to the point where I was comfortable enough in
                    lecturing to a large class to drop my dependence on written notes. So that was
                    one consideration. The other was that we found Williamstown, for all its natural
                    beauty, a rather isolated place, tucked away in the far northwest corner of
                    Massachusetts, about 200 miles from New York and Boston. The winters there get
                    very cold and unless you like to ski, which we didn't, they can really be
                    dreadful. A third factor was that Paul Clark, a senior member of the Economics
                    Department and former Chairman of the Center for Development Economics, took a
                    sabbatical at USAID in 1969 to be Assistant Administrator for the Program and
                    Policy Coordination (PPC) Bureau. He told me about his experience there and that
                    if I was thinking about other things, I might want to think about USAID; it was
                    a good place to work, an exciting one, and that he would be happy to recommend
                    me. I had explored a couple of other possibilities as well: one to stay in
                    academia but move to a more hospitable climate, such as New Mexico State
                    University where I had an offer, as well as an offer to join a consulting firm,
                    the old Lillienthal outfit, Development Resources International (DRI). But after
                    talking with people like Clark, I decided to go with USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you joined USAID when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: In 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What position did you go into?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I joined the PPC Bureau as the first economist specializing on
                    employment problems in developing countries, taking advantage of my background
                    in labor economics. The ILO comes into the picture here again. While I was
                    there, the World Employment Program, sponsored by the ILO, was just getting
                    started with over half a dozen intensive country case studies on employment
                    problems in developing countries. The studies on Colombia, Kenya, and the
                    Philippines, in particular, became landmarks in the literature on development.
                    Largely as a result of the ILO work, donors started paying more attention to
                    employment and income distribution problems in development. I was the first
                    economist brought into USAID to focus on these problems. As a result, I
                    immediately began representing USAID at a number of international meetings,
                    including conferences on employment and development at Cambridge University in
                    1970 and at the ILO in Geneva in early 1971.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Administrator then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: John Hannah , former President of Michigan State University. Ernie
                    Stern , who subsequently became Senior VP at the World Bank, headed PPC; and Bob
                    Muscat, who became USAID's first Chief Economist, as well as my closest friend
                    and “mentor” at USAID, was first Deputy, and then Director of the Policy
                    Development Office where I worked. Mike Roemer, who is now Director of the
                    Harvard Institute for International Development , was my immediate boss, as
                    Chief of the Economic Analysis Division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An extraordinary group. What was the view point on
                        development that was being put forth at that time by PPC and USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was very much in tune with the thinking at Williams College, plus
                    the new wrinkle of employment and income distribution, where I was supposed to
                    be the spear carrier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More of the classical economics perspective, market
                        oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. But recognizing that especially in the area of employment, there
                    were real problems that had to be addressed. However, one of the reasons given
                    for sluggish employment growth was that countries had not adopted free market
                    economic policies but rather trade, financial and labor market policies that
                    distorted incentives in favor of excessively capital intensive choices of
                    technologies and product mix.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a period of major emphasis on policy reforms ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What we call structural adjustment these days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, except that developing countries were a lot more sensitive and
                    resistant to macro-economic “policy dialogue” than they are now. Now a number of
                    voices in the NGO community have been raised against structural adjustment; they
                    allege that the negative impact of structural adjustment on low-income countries
                    outweighs any positive effects. But that's getting a bit ahead of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, we were still in the cold war period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. The cold war clearly got into the debate. Some developing
                    countries saw “policy reform” as some kind of ideological or cold war thing that
                    we were pushing on them. Also, I think the cold war environment interfered with
                    USAID's ability to push policy concerns in some recipient countries because to
                    do so would conflict with US cold war interests as perceived by the Embassy and
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you illustrate that; do you have any specific
                        situation in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: By the time I joined the Foreign Service and had that in-depth
                    experience of living in a country, cold war dimensions were receding. And I had
                    Ambassadors in both Sri Lanka and Thailand who were pretty supportive on policy
                    dialogue. But in the earlier years, there were occasional discussions in
                    Washington or on TDYs that got into this issue. For example, I recall getting
                    involved in a discussion in Zaire where I was told in so many words: “This is a
                    strategic place; they've got strategic minerals; we can't push as much as we
                    might like; the Soviets are eyeing Zaire hungrily; we can only go so far with
                    policy dialogue.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the word from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: This was from the Embassy to the USAID Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were working from the PPC perspective in a
                        dialogue with the State Department on policy toward Zaire? That was a period
                        when we had substantial economic support funds?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there other cases or examples where your work related
                        to some of these policy issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: One example that comes to mind is in the opposite category, where the
                    US strongly supported a policy change against host government opposition. At
                    issue was a proposed sector loan to Colombia for housing and urban development.
                    Part of my job during a TDY was to push for income distribution criteria to
                    select which people could qualify for a housing loan. The head of the national
                    planning office objected to these conditions which would have required different
                    proportions of the loan to go to different income groups for different types of
                    housing. He argued that this was a matter of national sovereignty, saying, in so
                    many words that “if these strings are going to be attached to your money,
                    Colombia doesn't need US assistance.” The USG stuck to its position, and this
                    led to a phase-out of US bilateral aid to Colombia, which was renewed in
                    subsequent years, but then focused mainly on anti-narcotics. I was rather
                    surprised at the time that the State Department didn't intervene to reverse the
                    policy position on the loan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have a feel for why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I've forgotten what the specifics were, but there were other problems
                    the US was having with Colombia at the time, and the aid program had already
                    fallen to rather modest levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a period when we were doing pioneering sector
                        loans in Latin America; that was a policy of USAID at that time. Probably
                        the first time we had linked policy reform to sector reforms.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to mention any other aspects of your work in
                        PPC, such as philosophy or policies that you worked on specifically? And
                        your work on employment, did that progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, several things were done. In 1972, I produced in collaboration
                    with a PPC colleague, Ed Cohn, a USAID policy paper on “Employment and Income
                    Distribution Objectives for AID Programs and Policies” (see full citation at
                    second entry in Bibliography at the end of this Oral History). Also, I managed a
                    major research contract with the Yale Economic Growth Center on employment
                    problems in less developed countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did USAID have major programs in those areas; how did we
                        respond programmatically to those policies?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>ERIKSSON: That was a major part of my job. We developed training modules on
                    employment and income distribution for USAID training courses: Ed Cohn and I
                    made many presentations in USAID and other organizations in Washington and at
                    the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD in Paris; we injected
                    employment and income criteria into reviews of preliminary project and loan
                    documents at review and approval meetings in Washington. In those days, of
                    course, the whole project and program approval process was much more centralized
                    than it is now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were these policies manifested in certain projects?
                        What were we trying to bring about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: This depends on whether you are talking about the strategy stage or the
                    project stage. At the strategy stage, we were looking for a balanced program
                    with a mix of activities, labor- intensive road construction and other
                    employment creating activities. At the project stage, we were raising issues
                    about whether the policy framework of the country might thwart accomplishment of
                    the project objectives. [See “first Year Status Report,” October 1973, cited as
                    the third entry in the Bibliography at the end of this Oral History.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you address the income distribution issue ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That was a fairly controversial issue. One factor was the so-called
                    “New Directions” legislation in 1973, which put a lot of emphasis on programs
                    benefitting the poor. That resulted in some movement away from policy dialogue
                    with countries and toward a focus on specific projects intended to directly
                    benefit the poor. Another argument was that income distribution or
                    redistribution goals could be pushed too far, so that economic growth would be
                    threatened. If you talk about income redistribution, you have to have something
                    to redistribute; you need growth of income, growth of the economic base. That
                    led to development of the phrase, “Growth with Equity.” This implied that with
                    growth, at least the absolute incomes of the poor should improve. But you could,
                    and do, have situations where there is economic growth along with widening of
                    the relative income distribution. But the key thing is that the absolute incomes
                    of the poor should grow.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, by the mid-'70s, many people within and outside USAID believed that
                    the foreign assistance legislation required USAID to really get out there with
                    projects exclusively aimed at the poorest of the poor. Consequently, several of
                    us in PPC under Alex Shakow's leadership focused on trying to correct what we
                    saw as a distortion, to correct what we thought were misguided views, both on
                    the part of some in the Agency as well as on the Hill. We believed that to most
                    effectively meet the objectives of both growth and equity, one had to focus on
                    the “poor majority,” as opposed to the “poorest of the poor ;” that to focus
                    exclusively on the “poorest of the poor” was almost as misguided as focusing on
                    the rich.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where does the phrase “poorest of the poor” come from? Was
                        that part of a congressional initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That remains a mystery to me. I know that the phrase was used by some
                    in order to negate any concern with equity. That was part of our crusade in PPC;
                    to point out that we were trying to steer a middle course between the poorest of
                    the poor, on the one hand, and having no concern at all with employment or
                    equity, on the other, which would mean basically “trickle down.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in PPC during a period of unusual transition
                        and turmoil from the classical policy reform, market-oriented view through
                        this shift into extremes at the other end, such as, “poorest of the poor”
                        and “basic needs,” and then back towards “growth with equity.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's right - trying to bring the pendulum back a bit. Even within
                    PPC, there were different voices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your role develop in this because you came out of
                        a more classical economics orientation but with the labor interest which
                        somewhat moderated the more rigid doctrine? What was your own view of what
                        was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I very much agreed with Alex Shakow and my immediate boss at the time,
                    John Mellor. Namely, that growth was extremely important and that while there
                    were certainly instances of market failure that one needed to address, and
                    certain things that required government leadership and investment, such as
                    “public goods” type investments, for a large share of the rest of the economy,
                    the market should be allowed to operate freely, with government setting the
                    basic rules of the game in terms of enforcement of contracts and private
                    property.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But where should USAID focus its resources? Your
                        recommendations? What did you all actually recommend as proof of the
                        policies where resources should be concentrated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: One recommendation was to concentrate on certain “public goods,” such
                    as basic education, basic health services, agricultural research, and rural
                    farm-to-market roads. We saw the multilateral banks as having the main role for
                    major physical infrastructure like trunk highways, electrical grids and
                    telecommunications systems. With an exception for countries where US assistance
                    resources were so abundant, as in Egypt, that we had to find ways of using them
                    for things like electric power, telephone systems, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Congressional relations? Did you have much
                        exposure to Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Some, with somewhat more later in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But at this particular time were Alex Shakow and Ernie
                        Stern very active with Congressional matters? Were you caught up in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Not so much under Stern but under Shakow, more so. I was one of the
                    principal authors of a 1975 International Relations Committee Report,
                    Implementation of “New Directions” in Development Assistance (see full citation
                    at fourth entry in Bibliography at the end of this Oral History). Our report
                    stressed very heavily the “poor majority” viewpoint as contrasted with the
                    “poorest of the poor.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wrote it for Congress, for a Congressional
                        Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. It was a report that Congress had requested from the
                    Administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My recollection is that there was a report from Congress
                        that was very critical of USAID because it didn't have almost instant impact
                        on direct basic needs; and they were saying that they expected in one year
                        to have evidence of effects. And I remember that caused quite a reaction in
                        saying the Congress was being very unrealistic about what you could
                        accomplish in basic needs impact. And my question is whether this was a
                        response to that or a way of redoing that report. Because from my own
                        experience Congress was beating the table about why you haven't done
                        something immediately; immediate impact. It would be interesting for you to
                        elaborate when you can. That was at the very nexus of a policy shift and in
                        relations with Congress; we don't often sit down and write a Congressional
                        report from the Executive Branch side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's right. I also remember discussion with the Hill on the question
                    of appropriate technology. Clarence Long (Representative from Maryland), who was
                    Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee on the House Appropriations
                    Committee, first pushed the notion that USAID assistance to an enterprise or
                    individuals in developing countries should not exceed $300.00 per person. That
                    notion is still around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the microenterprise loans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What period are we talking about for your time in
                        PPC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The total period was (actually I spent a third of my career in the
                    Civil Service) seven years, from 1970 to 1978, not counting the 1975-76 academic
                    year when I took a leave-of-absence at Arizona State University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a very important period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything of substantive importance during your
                        year's leave of absence at Arizona State University?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I taught undergraduate courses in labor economics and development as
                    well as the principles courses; similar to the courses I taught at Williams. I
                    also taught some graduate courses and wrote an article on foreign assistance to
                    Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the line of that article?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The line of the article was that the allocation of US assistance to
                    countries reflected a mixture of criteria: political and economic. If one used
                    strictly economic criteria, there would be a substantial divergence from the
                    actual pattern. [See “Trends in the Volume and Composition of Aid to Latin
                    America,” full citation at fifth entry in Bibliography at the end of this Oral
                    History.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is an interesting case that you make there; may be we
                        can elaborate a bit more later. Anything more about that PPC period; you had
                        an important role in some of the policy debates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was my only time in print in a newspaper. I wrote a letter to the
                    editor of the Washington Post in 1977, an “op ed” piece. I opposed a very
                    critical piece on US foreign assistance policy that had appeared the previous
                    week, written by another USAID staffer, Roger Darling, of the training
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the point of your article?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The point of my article was taking the other tack; Darling's article
                    argued that the “New Directions” legislation's emphasis on the poor was
                    misguided and that it was not the way to get development or growth. My article
                    argued that on the contrary, properly addressed, concern with the poor and
                    growth were consistent with each other as well as morally right. Darling said in
                    so many words that the poor don't have any rights. That, in fact, was the title
                    of my “Op Ed” piece, “The Poor Do Have Rights.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Properly addressed? What does proper mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Properly addressed means not losing sight of the importance of economic
                    growth. We are not talking about welfare programs or hand outs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you do then; what was the main line of
                        activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I said that assistance should help the poor help themselves in
                    developing their own capacities in projects concerned with education, health,
                    and family planning, as well as in agricultural production and infrastructure
                    projects. All of these are concerned with growth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pick up again on the period 1970-78, which was a
                        very important policy evolving time; what were some of the other dimensions
                        that come to mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was in the latter half of the '70s that concern about the
                    environment really came to the fore; for example, the first world environment
                    conference in Stockholm. USAID, as in so many other areas, was a pioneer among
                    donors in being concerned about the environment; we were the first donor to
                    require environmental impact statements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any idea why USAID suddenly seemed to take an
                        interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was partly, I think, Congressional pressure; there was increasing
                    concern about the environment in the US. The Environmental Protection Agency
                    (EPA) was formed in the '70s. But there are two sides of the Congressional role.
                    In USAID we have complained a lot about the extent to which some committees and
                    members of Congress have followed our programs, labeling it “micromanagement,”
                    and have looked enviously at other bilateral donors that have had a more distant
                    relationship from legislatures or parliaments. But I think there has been a
                    positive side to it too, i.e., some domestic concerns do have an international
                    component to them. Because of the legislative oversight, these concerns get
                    picked up more rapidly, which has resulted in USAID becoming a leader among
                    donors.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Women-in-development is another case in point where USAID, partly owing to
                    Congressional interest and pressure, has been a leader. Population also,
                    although I don't know as much about the history there, and to what extent the
                    Congress was involved. I do know that a lot of the credit for USAID's leadership
                    in population has been ascribed to one USAID official, Dr. Ray Ravenholt. That
                    brings to mind a common role of PPC, that of critic, of in this case being
                    against population programs that focus exclusively on the “supply side” of
                    population programs, i.e., an exclusive concern with the provision of
                    contraceptives as opposed to looking at a range of socio-economic contextual
                    factors that influence fertility and family size directly, and indirectly
                    through the desire for family planning. It is now almost conventional wisdom
                    that female education and improvement in the status of women are extremely
                    important determinants of family size, but this was not the common view 20 years
                    ago.</p>

                    at sixth entry in Bibliography at the end of this Oral History). It was intended
                    as a synthesis between the emphasis of earlier years on the need for public
                    infrastructure investment to encourage growth, on the one hand, and program and
                    policies aimed at employment generation and benefiting the poor, on the other.
                    In some ways it was a document similar to the document prepared for the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee but in this case aimed at USAID staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would be useful to have an elaboration of that policy,
                        later. Was there any other dimension of that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No, although there were a few issues that were “blips on the horizon,”
                    which became more significant in the '80s. One was an increased emphasis on the
                    private sector as an alternative for the provision of some services that had
                    previously been viewed as being in the public sector realm, for example, the
                    marketing of contraceptives. Of course, under Peter McPherson , USAID
                    Administrator during the first half of the '80s, there was a big push in that
                    direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: In terms of the private sector, no. But another category was the
                    introduction of social and economic considerations into what I had previously
                    been considered strictly in terms of physical and technical dimensions: support
                    for biological research, particularly agricultural research and the beginnings
                    of emphasis on farming systems research. Another topic is ethnicity as a factor
                    in development. People are seized with it now, after the end of the Cold War;
                    the Cold War, in fact, hid ethnic issues that were there all along, as Daniel
                    Moynihan has brilliantly brought out in a recent book called Pandemonium. But,
                    with a few exceptions, the role of ethnicity in development was little
                    recognized in the '70s. It does have a bearing on my first Foreign Service
                    assignment, however, as Deputy Mission Director for the Sri Lanka USAID program
                    from 1978 to 1980.</p>
                <p>Assignment in Sri Lanka as Deputy Mission Director</p>
                <p>Tom Arndt was the first USAID Director in Sri Lanka after it reopened in 1977.
                    Tom said he would love to have me come out to be his deputy. In those days Sri
                    Lanka was really the darling of the development assistance community because it
                    seemed like it was doing everything right; it had in its earlier years
                    emphasized the social dimensions; the so called “physical quality of life”
                    (PQLI) dimension. Partly because of the British policy which emphasized
                    education, health and infrastructure, literacy and longevity were quite high and
                    infant mortality was quite low relative to per capita income in Sri Lanka.
                    However, under Prime Minister Bandaranaike during the early and mid-70's, Sri
                    Lanka had followed disastrous economic policies. In 1978, under a new government
                    headed by J.R. Jayawardene , there was a move back to free market policies and
                    an opening towards the West. So, Sri Lanka looked like a marvelous place to go:
                    a real development laboratory.</p>
                <p>Tom Arndt was called back from Sri Lanka and replaced by Sarah Jane Littlefield,
                    quite a different personality from Tom. But Sarah Jane and I decided we could
                    work with each other. In fact, things turned out to work quite well; we
                    complemented each other, and I learned a tremendous amount from her. Sarah Jane
                    was one of my top mentors in USAID because she knew the nuts and bolts of field
                    operations so well, was a very strong manager and extremely loyal to her
                    staff.</p>
                <p>At this point I need to return to the issue of ethnicity and development. One of
                    my PPC colleagues, Jonathan Silverstone, Chief of the Civic Participation
                    Division in PPC, when he learned that I was converting to the Foreign Service
                    and going to Sri Lanka, said “That sounds wonderful and that should be really
                    exciting but let me raise one note of caution: there is a serious ethnicity
                    problem between the Tamil minority and the Singhalese majority simmering just
                    beneath the surface in Sri Lanka, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it explode.
                    His words were prophetic. Even during my tour there from 1978 to 1980, a state
                    of emergency had been called for several months in Northern Sri Lanka because
                    rebel groups, such as the “Tamil Tigers,” were already active. Ethnicity is a
                    problem we don't yet know how to reckon with very well in development.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went out to Sri Lanka with Tom Arndt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No. Sarah Jane Littlefield had arrived in Sri Lanka just a month or two
                    before I did. I enjoyed my tour thoroughly, but it was more of a mixed
                    experience for my family. They weren't prepared for the poverty they
                    encountered, notwithstanding Sri Lanka's higher standing in terms of social
                    indicators than other South Asian countries. For me, working in Sri Lanka was a
                    great professional experience, partly because the Ambassador was also the
                    leading US academic expert on the country: Howard Wriggins, Professor of Asian
                    History at Columbia University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you try to do; what was your mission
                        programmatically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was an exciting time to be there because the program was just
                    starting up after having been shut down five or six years. One of the center
                    pieces of the program was support for the massive Mahaweli River basin
                    development scheme, which consisted of a number of dams and associated
                    hydro-power plants, along with down-stream irrigation infrastructure and
                    resettlement of people from other parts of the country. Other interesting
                    projects included water management activities in different parts of the country,
                    environmental and reforestation projects, and a water supply project in northern
                    Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>Mission Director Littlefield and I had an agreed division of labor. I focused on
                    socio-economic issues and she focused on technical and administrative issues.
                    Among other things, it was my job to marshal academic experts to help us put
                    together the new assistance strategy. It was fortuitous that at the same time
                    Norman Upoff, political scientist from Cornell University, was on sabbatical at
                    the Agrarian Research and Training Institute in Sri Lanka. We forged a
                    friendship that continues. Norman's seminal work on participatory development
                    draws much of its inspiration from the work he did on one of the USAID-assisted
                    water management projects (”Gal Oya”) in Sri Lanka. I also recruited Cal Tech's
                    Ted Scudder, an anthropologist and one of the world's leading experts on river
                    basin settlement schemes in developing countries, and organized a symposium for
                    the Government with Scudder to discuss population resettlement issues in the
                    Mahaweli program. That led to work by Scudder which continues to this day,
                    through Ted's collaboration with Sri Lankan social scientists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main theme of the program that you were
                        involved in? Was there any core approach that related to the PPC policies?
                        How did you deal with the growth with equity question if that was the line
                        you were following? Were you still in the basic needs arena?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No, in response to your last question. I saw my objective as ensuring
                    that equity and employment considerations were taken into account in the program
                    in a sensible way; that they would not conflict with growth objectives, but not
                    get ignored either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in designing specific projects? Or was
                        it a matter of projects that came up and making sure they were
                        responsive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: For the most part, it was trying to ensure that projects were
                    consistent with our strategy. I did write the first “CDSS” (Country Development
                    Strategy Statement) for the Sri Lankan program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That had a line or rationale that you developed; maybe you
                        could articulate later what you saw was the theme? How about working with
                        the Sri Lankan people? How did you find that experience in terms of your
                        ability to communicate, the acceptance of your ideas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON:: It is a little hard to judge in a way because it was a while ago and
                    partly because it was my first tour. But my recollection is a positive one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You met with the government regularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, and I developed good contacts with the top civil servants
                    (Permanent Secretaries) of six key Ministries with whom we worked most closely,
                    as well as with the heads of the research and statistics departments of the
                    Central Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in those contacts did you find receptivity to the
                        concepts that you and USAID were trying to put forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: By and large yes; you also have to take into account that Sri Lanka was
                    a fairly receptive environment for a “growth with equity” approach at that
                    particular time. Coming out of the ethos of a heavy emphasis on social
                    development; and then the more free-market orientation of the Jayawardene
                    Government. There were some people who were not as convinced, however. That was
                    more difficult. For example, the head of the Mahaweli Authority, who was in a
                    very critical position and had come from the private sector as head of the
                    largest accounting firm in Sri Lanka. He was not persuaded about the importance
                    of farmer organizations, especially water-user associations, which was one of
                    our major emphases, one in which I was heavily involved. However, we did find
                    some “champions” of water-user associations that we could productively work with
                    in the Irrigation Department and with the Permanent Secretary of Land
                    Development. This is an example of the axiom that “no government is
                    monolithic.”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The idea you were promoting at that time, while not still
                        generally accepted, planted a seed; something that has proved successful
                        over time. Other aspects of the program that you felt were particularly
                        significant: both as successes and not successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: We supported a water supply project in Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka .
                    If one did an expost analysis of this project, I think the technical design
                    flaws would show it to have had a negative rate of return. But there was a lot
                    of pressure to do something at that time, to have some project activity in
                    northern Sri Lanka that would be seen to be benefiting the Tamil population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you trying to address the ethnicity issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: We were, in fact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think, apart from the technical aspect, there were
                        any positive effects vis-a-vis the ethnic issues and concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Perhaps. I remember that in the summer of 1979, I accompanied Alex
                    Shakow, who was visiting from Washington, on a field trip to Jaffna. We met with
                    local leaders, including someone whom I suspected was very closely connected
                    with the rebel leadership. We received what we thought were sincere expressions
                    of appreciation for the US assistance. I still have my doubts about the economic
                    justification for the project, but in any event, the explosion of the ethnic
                    crisis in 1983 swamped everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any more on the Sri Lankan experience at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I don't think so. The only additional thing I might say is that had it
                    been strictly up to me, I would have opted for a second tour in Sri Lanka. But
                    the family decision was to return to the US. One factor was that the
                    international school in Colombo did not go beyond the eight grade at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about one last point about relationships with the
                        Embassy? How would you characterize the interaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: By and large, positive. I don't recall any significant substantive
                    disagreements on the directions of our program. I do recall that Sarah Jane got
                    into some nasty fights with the DCM over administrative issues, a typical thing.
                    But not on substance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any cold war intrusion at all in this situation
                        or was this a purely development interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Very little. The Soviets had a presence there then, but it was scaled
                    back during the Jayawardene regime compared to what it had been during Mrs.
                    Bandaranaike's administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a relatively pure development
                        situation...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The cold war didn't intervene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The motivation for the program was driven by development
                        philosophy..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, I would say so. But another factor underpinning the financial
                    level of assistance was that the US continued to see Sri Lanka playing some
                    balancing role in the Cold War. Sri Lanka was the leader of the so-called
                    “Non-Aligned Movement,” which, ironically, made it an actor, albeit a relatively
                    minor one, in the Cold War game. The US had some naval rights (as did the
                    Soviets, I believe) to use of the excellent Indian Ocean deep water harbor in
                    eastern Sri Lanka, at Trincomalee, and the US also had a Voice-of-America
                    transmitter in north-central Sri Lanka. These were considerations, but they
                    never seemed to loom very large, at least in my work. Of course, I wasn't
                    regularly attending the “Country Team Meetings” at the Embassy, so I wasn't
                    fully aware of all the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The driving motivation for having such a large
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I think it was mainly for development reasons, that Sri Lanka was an
                    important laboratory of development, both on social and economic fronts. Other
                    donors were also heavily involved for similar reasons. But I suspect that my
                    Embassy colleagues would have given the geo-political factors I have already
                    mentioned a heavier weight in providing a rationale for the level of US aid to
                    Sri Lanka.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say this was part of that era when development

                <p>ERIKSSON: In some places in the world, and I think that Sri Lanka at this time

                <p>Return to PPC: chief of the policy development office</p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I came back to head the Policy Development and Program Review Office in
                    PPC when Alex Shakow was still Assistant Administrator. That was in the early
                    fall of 1990. Reagan won the Presidential election that November, and by the end
                    of the year Alex was in the process of moving to the World Bank. Peter McPherson
                    was confirmed as the new USAID Administrator, and John Bolton, after a temporary
                    stint by Tom Rollis, was confirmed as the new AA for PPC. Bolton was both
                    conservative and very bright. Seeing the importance of policy and policy
                    development, he decided he wanted a full set of new policy papers to cover
                    everything that USAID did. My office was charged with the task. In three years,
                    1990 to 1993, we produced over twenty policy papers, including one for each of
                    the four McPherson “policy pillars” (1) policy reform, (2) technology
                    development and transfer, (3) institutional development, and (4) private sector
                    development. In terms of cranking out policy papers, that was one of the most
                    productive times that I can recall — for me and for PPC. The quality of papers
                    varied, of course, but some were, I thought, really quite good. I was fortunate
                    in having some really first rate people on my staff, some of whom have risen to
                    very high positions. For example, Ann Van Dusen was one of my division chiefs;
                    she is now the Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Global Bureau, formerly
                    the S&amp;T Bureau. John Wesley was an economist in one of my divisions; he
                    subsequently became Mission Director in Kenya and is now Mission Director in
                    Egypt, USAID's largest program and mission. Joe Stepanek, former Tanzania
                    Mission Director, and now Zambia Mission Director, was in my agriculture and
                    rural development division. Jerry Wolgin was also an economist in my office and
                    now heads the Technical Office of the Africa Bureau. One of Jerry's main
                    contributions to our work was a policy paper on recurrent cost financing which
                    drew strong praise from World Bank economists, the only USAID policy paper that
                    -at least so far as I know- has received that distinction!</p>

                <p>I began my second stint in PPC with some trepidation, in view of the new
                    administration and uncertainty over its views about foreign assistance. But it
                    turned out in retrospect to have been quite a positive experience for me, which
                    I would ascribe in significant measure to the Administrator, Peter McPherson,
                    his personal style and his commitment to development. He loved to get involved
                    in substantive dialogue and he reached out to staff directly. He would pick up
                    the phone and call me on a number of occasions to discuss a substantive
                    question, something no administrator has done before or since. I would often be
                    involved in discussions in McPherson's office on substantive topics. Some have
                    questioned the “efficiency” of McPherson's approach for a top manager. But it
                    was much appreciated by staff, and I know from talking with colleagues that I am
                    not alone in these views. Naturally, McPherson brought some conservative
                    philosophy with him, including a great faith in the private sector. But those
                    were exciting years; there was a lot of ferment intellectually. That was the
                    beginning of the whole reexamination of the relative roles of the private and
                    public sectors, both in the US and in the developing world. There was some
                    ideology involved, but people recognized that the empirical experience of the
                    public sector in providing goods and services was very mixed. And there were the
                    looming budget constraints limiting what the public sector could do in any
                    event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a major shift from the previous New Directions
                        philosophy to this one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: In some ways, no. The new administration clearly eschewed public
                    programs that sought to provide goods and services directly to the poor that
                    could be provided by the private sector. There was much more emphasis on the
                    policy and institutional framework; the so-called “enabling environment,” and on
                    “public goods” like agricultural research, but still with an emphasis on the
                    poor majority and on human resource development. So it was something of a
                    synthesis of old and new; it didn't require very much of a shift of “paradigm.”
                    It added on some new dimensions but did not drop very much, at least from where
                    I was intellectually. One issue did surface, which continued off and on
                    throughout the 12 years of the Reagan/Bush Administrations. Namely, how one can
                    best help the private sector. The issue was: do we concentrate on the enabling
                    environment and institutions that provide a good sound environment for the
                    private sector or, in addition to that, do we actually get involved in making
                    direct equity investments in the private sector itself? The arguments first
                    surfaced in the early '80s. But when I came back to PPC in 1990 for the next two
                    years of the Bush Administration, they were still raging, with some people in
                    the USAID administration, including the head of the private enterprise bureau,
                    arguing very strongly that USAID had a role in giving direct support to the
                    private sector through equity investments. Others argued that this is not
                    USAID's forte, that this was something the private sector itself did best. There
                    was a small “window” in-between where some argued that a “demonstration project”
                    (e.g., an equity investment in a newly privatized tire manufacturing plant)
                    might in some circumstances be justified if it could be shown that such support
                    would have a substantial catalytic or “spread” effect. This battle continued
                    throughout the 12 years of the Reagan/Bush era and was never fully resolved.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the impression at the time-and your view is
                        important here- that the administration's views were sort of
                        anti-government. It wasn't a balanced view in terms of the government's and
                        the private sector's role. It was sort of at the extreme: either ignoring,
                        or a “no government is good government” attitude.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, there was some of that; I think the more thoughtful people would
                    not have gone that far; but there were people who basically had the notion that
                    the less government, the better. It is true that assisting governments to become
                    more effective, public administration training, for example, was relatively
                    neglected or discouraged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But from what you were saying and my impression was that
                        even during the Reagan Administration, there were some very strong
                        ideological clashes among the people in the same administration in USAID.
                        That's more than I've seen in many administrations. Did you find that there
                        were really strong factions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, fairly strong. I don't know if they were stronger than the clashes
                    that surfaced during the Carter years between those who thought exclusively in
                    terms of the “poorest of the poor” and basic needs, and those who took the
                    broader view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good point. Where was Administrator McPherson in
                        all the argument?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I think he was basically on the side of those who emphasized the
                    importance of the enabling environment, although he didn't rule out some direct
                    support for equity investment. In the latter case, I don't know if it was
                    because he really thought that way or because of political tugs and pulls of
                    which I wasn't always aware.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your sense of the Agency's response; all those
                        bureaucrats there who went though one transition after another. How did they
                        respond to the many policy papers and changes that you all were defining for
                        them. How did they affect the Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's hard to tell. Some staff claimed they ignored the policy papers.
                    But questions were certainly raised in reviews of strategies, programs and
                    projects to try to ensure consistency with policies. So people had to pay
                    attention to them in that sense, whether they wanted to or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much participation was there from the rest of the
                        agency in the shaping of these policy papers or was it largely just the PPC
                        staff writing them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: There was vetting elsewhere in the Agency, although I think less so
                    than in the past. Bolton was very firm on keeping to a fairly rigorous time
                    frame and didn't want the vetting process to go on too long. And he was prepared
                    to beat down continued comments or objections, even if they emanated from other
                    members of the senior staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That relates to the question of how these policies were
                        implemented and reflected in field operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. There is a trade-off between getting these things out, on the one
                    hand, and developing some ownership of them, on the other hand, so they will be
                    followed and paid attention to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else about that period? You seemed to
                        have moved right into the hot moments in the PPC policy world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Right. I did make some interesting TDYs during that period. One had to
                    do with an issue that John Bolton got very exercised about: centralization
                    versus decentralization. I took a trip to the Philippines , Thailand and
                    Indonesia to look at the relevant policies and experiences of those governments
                    and the USAID programs in supporting decentralization. They more or less
                    confirmed Bolton's his view that “there is decentralization and there is
                    decentralization.” Some forms of decentralization of government are nothing more
                    than extending the arm of central government more effectively, but real
                    authentic decentralization typically involves not just the devolvement of
                    responsibilities but also of authorities and ultimately the capability to raise
                    revenues at the local level. This illustrates what made the policy work in USAID
                    interesting — that we did not just sit back in Washington and write something ex
                    cathedra, but that we did so in conjunction with field trips to take a look at
                    the situation on the ground, to try ideas out and to relate policy papers on
                    field realities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when the Women-in-Development policy paper was
                        written?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It was around that time; at least, there was a WID “policy
                    determination” - a shorter form of a policy paper that came out around that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Deputy Assistant Administrator in the Science and Technology Bureau: research
                    planning and child survival task force</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: In the fall of 1983, Curt Farrar, Deputy Assistant Administrator (DAA)
                    of the Science and Technology Bureau, gave me a call. McPherson had brought in
                    Dr. Nyle Brady, former Director General of IRRI (the International Rice Research
                    Institute) in the Philippines, to head a new Bureau for Science and Technology,
                    which had previously been the Technical Assistance and the Development Support
                    Bureaus. Brady had two deputies: former Peru Mission Director Len Yaeger, who
                    was Deputy for Field Support, and Curt Farrar, who, with long experience in the
                    technical bureaus of USAID, was Deputy for Research. At that point Curt was in
                    the process of moving to the Consultative Group on International Agriculture
                    (CIGAR) at the World Bank to head their technical secretariat. I was approached
                    about my possible interest in taking Curt's place. That was a totally new idea
                    to me, and working for someone like Brady gave me pause since he had quite a
                    reputation as being very strong-willed manager. But he was also highly regarded
                    as a very knowledgeable and skilled science administrator. I talked with him and
                    others, including Bolton and McPherson. I came to two conclusions: one, that
                    this could be a really interesting and challenging assignment, and secondly,
                    perhaps the top brass wanted this move since both McPherson and Bolton said they
                    thought it “would be good” for me. When someone tells you something like that,
                    there is often a “hidden agenda.” In fact, I was replaced in PPC by a political
                    appointee to head that office, the first time in my memory that a career officer
                    had not been in the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps there was political pressure from ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Perhaps. At any rate, the next three years were quite a new,
                    knowledge-expanding experience for me. I really developed an appreciation for
                    the role of research in development that I never had before, particularly in
                    fields like agriculture and health and what had been accomplished in the
                    international agricultural research system. During my tenure in the S&amp;T
                    Bureau, UNICEF began its child survival campaign, with the emphasis on
                    immunization. McPherson picked up on Oral Rehydration Therapy as USAID's
                    distinctive contribution. I was tasked with chairing the first Child Survival
                    Task Force in USAID and was in charge of preparing the first Child Survival
                    Report to Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was all that interest ...given the private sector,
                        anti-government orientation, and little sense of basic needs concerns, and
                        yet we get all this big push on child survival, oral rehydration, etc.? It
                        seemed to be a little inconsistent with the more market oriented, private
                        sector push.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I think that McPherson accepted that, as opposed to other types of
                    economic activity, research and development in some areas like agriculture,
                    health and environment (to a certain extent) were legitimate areas for public
                    investment. These were in a sense “public goods.” Without the push of the public
                    sector and direct public sector support, the private sector would not by itself
                    invest in agricultural research in developing countries or invest in research on
                    tropical diseases afflicting people in developing countries, because sufficient
                    profit was not envisioned to justify the investment. Therefore, public sector
                    subsidies were justified. There may have been another reason: strong ties by
                    McPherson, who had been on the “BIFAD” (Board for International Food and
                    Agricultural Development) , and Brady to the land grant universities. The land
                    grant model is basically a public sector model: public university research,
                    teaching and extension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But to take the other aspect when you were involved in the
                        child survival and the oral rehydration programs, why, given the opposition
                        to basic human needs and the rejection of that approach, was this such a
                        major concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I think it was justified in a couple of ways: one, it had a research
                    element to it. I remember some tensions even within the S&amp;T Bureau between
                    Dr. Brady, who wanted to emphasize the research component in the Child Survival
                    program, and others, who wanted to emphasize financing the delivery of child
                    survival services. There was also the fact that child survival programs were
                    more in the area of human resource development and viewed as quasi-public goods
                    in an area where the private sector could not be expected to do the job. By
                    contrast, support for government parastatals in agriculture and manufacturing,
                    such as marketing boards, fertilizer distribution organizations, etc., were a
                    “no-no.” And while McPherson was very strong on the private sector, he also
                    carried with him a very strong ethical commitment to helping the poor in
                    developing countries (even though he often thought the private sector could do
                    this job better than the public sector). Finally, I think there was one other
                    factor. There was some sensitivity in the Administration to criticisms that they
                    were “hard-hearted” and ignoring the poor majority. One must also recall the
                    fact that while it was a Republican Administration, the Democratic majority
                    continued in Congress. Congress was, in fact, a main source of the criticisms.
                    So, with McPherson pushing very strongly, the Administration, including Reagan,
                    who gave his personal support to the initiative at some point, got on the Child
                    Survival band wagon. They could and did say, “What are you talking about? We
                    support this wonderful program focused on the poor, on children and
                    mothers.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got a lot of support from Congress and more than you
                        even asked for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's right. Another factor was that UNICEF, and Jim Grant who had
                    become the head of UNICEF, were very effective on the Hill. In fact, this led to
                    a “friendly competition” between UNICEF and USAID regarding support for child
                    survival programs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything distinctive about the strategy you were
                        involved in developing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: For me it was interesting because it was the first time I had gotten
                    involved in developing a strategy that went beyond general policy by issuing
                    operational guidance on criteria for Missions, and targets for Mission programs.
                    For example, a group of some 25 countries was identified as “Child Survival
                    Emphasis Countries.” Missions were instructed to have a child survival emphasis
                    in their programs because infant mortality rates were above 75 per thousand live
                    births in this group of countries. In my experience, Washington had not done
                    something like this before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was basically a program for mass
                        immunizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Immunization was one of a half dozen components. Immunizations and oral
                    rehydration were the two main components, but breast feeding, family planning,
                    child nutrition, reducing acute respiratory infections and water and sanitation
                    were also components.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: There was some discussion but not much. That did turn out to be one of
                    the major issues raised in a later CDIE evaluation, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned family planning. Were you involved in the
                        issues of population programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No, not very much, except for one issue. The “Mexico City Population
                    Policy” had been adopted by the Administration while I was in PPC. This policy
                    put some serious constraints on our ability to support family planning programs;
                    in fact, no direct support could be given to governments which supported
                    abortion, nor to indigenous NGOs that supported abortion. Since abortion is
                    legal in this country, USAID could still provide support to the Planned
                    Parenthood Federation, but the latter had to set up a water tight unit or
                    subsidiary for its international programs so that they were completely separated
                    from the domestic programs. I got involved because of a woman of Latin American
                    origin from Louisiana, and with strong ties to her Congressional
                    representatives, who was opposed not only to abortion but to all forms of
                    artificial birth control. She got a fair amount of political support to try to
                    force USAID to drop its support for artificial birth control and to provide
                    support for the so-called rhythm or “natural” method of birth control. She first
                    met with me, and then we had several meetings with Dr. Brady. I remember one
                    very tense discussion where, to his credit, Brady held his ground, and McPherson
                    subsequently backed him up. While we ended up having to provide some support for
                    R&amp;D on the rhythm method, we did not back off from supporting the delivery
                    of other forms of contraceptives nor from supporting research on other forms of
                    contraception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your own views of what was going on; were you
                        sympathetic with these more rigid standards or ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No. I'm pretty liberal as far as support for family planning is
                    concerned and certainly for any form of safe and effective contraception. I
                    don't like coercion of the kind practiced in China. But I see the provision of
                    safe and effective contraception as being one of the most important things that
                    can be done to reduce the number of dangerous abortions that take place in the
                    developing world, as well as to reduce high and unwanted fertility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in a bit of a bind in this policy
                        environment; did it make it difficult to ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, sometimes. The discussions with this woman, for example, I found
                    very uncomfortable. I was the first line of contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apart from that, did the Agency policy come out where you
                        were comfortable with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No, not entirely. I give credit to McPherson and Brady because they and
                    people like Duff Gillespie and Joe Spidel in the Population Office vigorously
                    supported USAID's position and programs. I was not happy about the restrictions
                    of the “Mexico City Policy,” and about the cessation of US support for UNFPA.
                    But given those constraints, I think the record of the McPherson administration
                    was pretty good because over all, bilateral support for family planning was
                    maintained.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: No, those are the main ones: health, agriculture, family planning,
                    environment and somewhat in industrial research. But there was generally a view
                    that the latter was an area that USAID should not get involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view or policy related to USAID funding
                        research at all? What kind of research? Did we support basic research or
                        operational research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: USAID supported what was called “problem-oriented research,” which
                    included applied and operations research, as well as some basic research as long
                    as it was directly related to a development problem. However, even that was “too
                    basic” for some people. What was clearly ruled out was basic research just to
                    expand the state of knowledge. One program which Dr. Brady and others had
                    supported very strongly ultimately became a “cropper.” This was the malaria
                    vaccine development program. It was controversial because people argued that
                    USAID had no business supporting that kind of research even though malaria, one
                    of the leading killers in the tropics, was a serious problem in the developing
                    world. The argument was that the time frame was so long, and there were still so
                    many hurdles to cross in developing an effective vaccine, that USAID should not
                    get involved. Moreover, the US Army was putting a fair amount of resources into
                    developing a malaria vaccine at the Walter Reed Army Medical Research Institute.
                    At one point there was actual competition going on between USAID-funded
                    researchers at New York University and researchers at the Walter Reed Institute.
                    I remember a press conference where McPherson and Brady were to announce some
                    new development at New York University and the Walter Reed people were there
                    criticizing it, saying it doesn't hold up and so on. Subsequently, after I left
                    the S&amp;T Bureau, the USAID manager of the malaria vaccine project was accused
                    of misappropriation of funds, and USAID support was terminated. All of this
                    reinforced the critics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did USAID decide on what it should put its money into
                        in research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Various review processes have been employed over the years, drawing on
                    expert knowledge of the subject areas from both within and outside the agency.
                    Other influences have included pressures from universities and the Congress. For
                    example, I was sharply rebuked by the Legislative Assistant to Senator Daniel
                    Inouye of Hawaii, who was then Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee
                    of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for even suggesting that continued USAID
                    support for research on “milkfish” at the Oceanic Institute in Hawaii was not a
                    priority for USAID. I was quickly instructed by the USAID Legislative Office
                    that continued S&amp;T Bureau support to the Oceanic Institute was a “price for
                    staying in business.”</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in BIFAD (Board for International Food
                        and Agricultural Development)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. They had a process, in which USAID participated, to establish
                    research priorities and select the “CRISPs” (the Collaborative Research Support
                    Programs) , which focused on different commodities or soil, water and related
                    agricultural research problems. They tried to identify subjects not yet
                    receiving attention from the International Agricultural Research Centers, which
                    were also supported from the S&amp;T Bureau budget. While I was in the S&amp;T
                    job, I attended several Board Meetings of these Centers, including “CIAT”
                    (International Center for Tropical Agriculture) in Colombia, “IITA”
                    (International Institute for Tropical Agriculture) in Nigeria, and “ILCA”
                    (International Livestock Center for Africa) in Ethiopia. I came away with a
                    great deal of respect for these centers and the systematic way they went about
                    establishing research priorities.</p>
                <p>Also, Dr. Brady was in constant contact with his R&amp;D administrator colleagues
                    in related organizations and thought he had a good sense of what were important
                    and researchable problems. Brady also used the mechanism of the S&amp;T sector
                    councils within the agency to help in setting priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a research advisory committee in those

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. There was an external “Research Advisory Committee” (RAC) that
                    reviewed support for research from the S&amp;T Bureau, but did not look very
                    much into research supported by field missions, or how well centrally-funded
                    research programs from the S&amp;T Bureau related to operational programs in the
                    field. Nor did it get very much into the issue of the appropriate balance
                    between sectors. It got more involved in intra-sectoral research priorities,
                    i.e., what kinds of research should be done within, say, agriculture, or
                    health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you mean by kinds of research?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: For example, whether biotechnology techniques should be employed in
                    agricultural or health research as opposed to other kinds of research
                    approaches. We had people like D.H. Henderson from John Hopkins University, Vern
                    Ruttan from the University of Minnesota, some excellent people. But that was an
                    external body that interacted with the S&amp;T Bureau and other USAID staff. The
                    Atwood Administration has abolished the RAC and replaced it with an internal
                    Research Council chaired by Carol Lancaster, Deputy Administrator, and including
                    the AAs and DAAs of the different bureaus. They are attempting to establish a
                    priority setting process for research for the entire Agency, including in the
                    field, as well as trying to tackle the inter-sectoral allocation problem.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Nobody from the outside. They invite people in from the outside on
                    occasion but not regular external advisors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Are there other dimensions of your
                        work in ... How did you sense the environment in USAID in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: There were some views that Brady had too much influence on McPherson
                    and that excessive scarce resources were going to R&amp;D programs. Yet,
                    overall, I think morale was relatively high in the Agency then. One factor was
                    that .. at the same time that there was a high emphasis on research and getting
                    out the new policies..there was the so-called “Decentralization Initiative,”
                    which gave field missions even more autonomy than they had previously had. Len
                    Yaeger, the S&amp;T Deputy for Field Support, played a central role in leading
                    this initiative. It gave Mission Directors the authority, once a strategy had
                    been approved by Washington, to approve preliminary Project Identification
                    Documents (PIDs) and final Project Papers in the field without going back to
                    Washington - unless Washington had said at the time of country assistance
                    strategy review that there was a controversial issue in a certain area they
                    wanted to review again at the time of project approval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But prior to McPherson's time all approvals or most all
                        went up to the Administrator; is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. All Project Papers went to the Assistant Administrator and those
                    above a certain amount went to the Administrator for authorization.</p>
                <p>

                <p>ERIKSSON: That was in the process of being changed during those years I was in
                    the S&amp;T Bureau. And I think most people in the Foreign Service saw that as a
                    positive development.</p>

                <p>ERIKSSON: I finished in PPC at the end of 1982; and finished in the S&amp;T
                    Bureau the end of 1985. I expressed an interest in going overseas and was
                    approached by the AA and DAA for the Asia Bureau about going to Thailand as
                    Mission Director. They thought that because of the new “flagship” project being
                    developed for the Thailand program, “S&amp;T for Development,” I would be a good
                    choice. In fact, a year earlier I had made a TDY to Thailand to help in the
                    development of the new project. So, I knew something about the project, the
                    USAID program and the country. They also thought that my approach and my
                    personality would be a good fit for the Thai cultural setting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Because my management and personal styles were seen to be compatible
                    with Thai culture: basically soft-spoken and non-confrontational, approaching
                    issues in a relatively indirect manner. My family discussed the proposal, and
                    the reaction was uniformly positive. We left for Bangkok in early January 1986
                    and returned four and half years later, in August 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main thrust of what you were trying to do
                        with the USAID program in Thailand? What was the setting in which you were
                        working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The setting was a program that had a long history; starting in the
                    early '50s. In fact, while I was there, the third cycle or anniversary of the
                    program was celebrated - cycles of twelve are important in Thai and Chinese
                    cultures. In the fall of 1987 a reception in honor of USAID was hosted by the
                    Prime Minister in Government House; a grand occasion. It illustrates the
                    significance of the program over the years in Thailand; the high mutual regard
                    between Thais and Americans.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Thailand, the program was already in transition, emphasizing
                    what the former Director Bob Halligan had called “Emerging Problems of
                    Development;” namely, second and third generation development problems, such as
                    science and technology; private sector deepening into areas like manufacturing
                    associations and financial markets; and natural resources and environment.
                    Projects in these areas became in fact the core of our program. Other projects
                    in health, family planning and agriculture and irrigation were all wound down
                    and completed while I was there. Both program and US Direct Hire staff levels
                    also came down.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>In terms what was happening in the country as a whole, the early '80s had not
                    been so good for Thailand: economic growth had slowed down although there are
                    many countries in the world which envied that “slow” growth in Thailand, about 3
                    per cent a year. However, in the latter half of the '80s, growth accelerated to
                    as high as 11 per cent a year. One of my major efforts was to try to develop a
                    sound “transition” program ... not only an advanced developed country
                    program....but a transition to Thailand's becoming a “graduate” country ,
                    graduating from economic assistance. I had in mind a mutually endowed
                    foundation, a joint foundation based on mutual contributions, mutual
                    participation, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. This had been tried
                    previously in a few countries, and had worked in some places but not in others.
                    I had heard that USAID Mission Director Joel Bernstein tried to promote
                    something like this in Korea but was not successful. The Joint Rural
                    Reconstruction Commission in Taiwan had some of the characteristics I was
                    looking for, as did the “Japanese-American Friendship Foundation.” I organized
                    some workshops in Thailand with outside experts to “brainstorm” a “graduate
                    strategy” along these lines for Thailand. I explored the possibility of
                    capturing the reflows from former loans that had been extended to Thailand,
                    capturing the repayments back to the US to use as an endowment for a joint
                    foundation. On one of my trips back to Washington, I met with the then Assistant
                    Secretary for International Affairs for Treasury, Peter McPherson, to pursue
                    this possibility. McPherson said, “Sorry, but no way.” It is Treasury policy to
                    use such repayments as contributions to the General Fund and any “recapture”
                    would be counted as new obligations against the USAID budget. Another factor was
                    continuing changes in Embassy and Washington leadership. During my almost five
                    years in Thailand, I reported to three different regional Assistant
                    Administrators. The two earlier AA's were sympathetic to my approach (Charlie
                    Greenleaf and Julia Chang Bloch) but the later one (Carol Adelman) was not. She
                    had her own ideas and dispatched her special assistant to Thailand to develop a
                    different approach that would rely much more heavily on the private sector and
                    rely exclusively on private sector-to-private sector cooperation. I also served
                    under two Ambassadors, one of whom was sympathetic to my approach, and the
                    other, with the later tenure, much less so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Daniel O'Donahue. He did not want to hear of any plans involving the
                    phase-out of the aid program. O'Donahue envisioned an aid program along
                    traditional lines continuing for the foreseeable future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a career ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. To make a long story short, the whole issue of a mechanism that
                    would involve a decent transition to graduation was left up in the air when I
                    left in 1990. I understand that within the last year or so, mainly due to the
                    efforts of the Asia Foundation Representative in Bangkok, Dick Blue (a former
                    USAID officer and Director of the PPC Evaluation Office in an earlier era), a
                    joint “partnership fund” has been set up between the US and Thailand, with
                    modest foundation and private sector funding. So, it looks like something of the
                    idea I had in mind will survive. In the meantime, Thailand was among the twenty
                    or so USAID country programs that the Administrator announced last year would be
                    phased out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are the characteristics of a graduate country? You
                        were proposing that aid be terminated because ... what was this condition
                        ... how do you reach a graduation level as a country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: There are a variety of indicators. First, there is per capita income,
                    which in Thailand was going above $1000 a year while I was there; now it is
                    around $1800 and grown very rapidly. Population growth has declined to about 1.5
                    per cent a year. One of the great USAID “success stories” in Thailand was the
                    voluntary family planning program where the US made a very critical
                    contribution; one of the major contributions in my view to sustained Thai
                    development. But beyond these, I think another important criterion for
                    “graduation” is the capacity of the country to raise resources itself, including
                    on the private capital market; and Thailand's capability to do that expanded
                    very rapidly during the late 80's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about its human resources ; that's often a condition
                        of capacity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, Thailand scores fairly well in this category, although there is
                    one weak spot. The record in basic education is very impressive; primary school
                    enrollment ratios for men and women are above 95 percent. However, there is a
                    significant drop at the secondary level and as compared with other countries in
                    the region. Korea is much higher, and even the Philippines and Indonesia have as
                    high, or higher, secondary enrollment ratios than Thailand. Nonetheless, my view
                    is that the Thai Government ought to be able to tackle this problem, to mobilize
                    the necessary resources and get on with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were involved in some special regional initiatives up
                        in the north, is that right? Was that going on while you were there? Why
                        were we involved in that and what was the result?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: This would be in the Northeast Region of Thailand . There is a long
                    history of efforts to develop the Northeast. It continues to be, and probably
                    always will be, the poorest region in the country; it is also the largest in
                    terms of area and population, accounting for about a third of each. The
                    agronomic conditions for productive agriculture are very limited in the
                    Northeast. Yet in the early years of the USAID program, especially in the '60s
                    and '70s, there was a lot of emphasis by the government on trying to develop the
                    Northeast, and with considerable US support. This support was justified partly
                    on equity grounds, but more importantly for geopolitical reasons because of the
                    region's proximity to Indochina. A lot of USAID resources went into a massive
                    road construction program in the Northeast, as well as into small scale
                    irrigation projects; dry land rainfed agriculture projects; malaria control; and
                    water supply and sanitation projects. The last vestiges of all these programs
                    were phased out during my tenure. Some people argued that we should remain in
                    Thailand to contribute to poverty oriented programs in the Northeast, similar to
                    the argument that the US should have remained in poverty-stricken Northeast
                    Brazil. But the counter argument is that the country has the resources to deal
                    in the most effective way with the Northeast on its own - with a combination of
                    programs in the region and letting migration take place out of the Northeast
                    into more dynamic parts of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the other programs you were phasing out...family
                        planning and so on... had done their jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: In the case of family planning, no question about it. The malaria
                    control program was also phased out while I was there; I think it had basically
                    it had done its job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Done its job meaning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The virtual elimination of malaria throughout the country except in
                    some remote border areas in the west bordering Burma; they were inaccessible
                    because of malaria coming across the border; and to some extent some parts of
                    the Cambodian border, but again because of endemic malaria on the other side of
                    the border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the impression but you can correct it that the USAID
                        program in Thailand benefited from being able to be a continuous process
                        without being interrupted like it has been in other countries where it was
                        terminated and started up again... Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, I think that is a factor, although relations did become quite
                    strained immediately after the Vietnam War , and the USAID program dipped quite
                    precipitously in 1976-77 - down to somewhere between $5-10 million a year. But
                    it never got zeroed out completely, and the USAID Mission and the large FSN
                    staff never got eliminated. By the late 70's, the program was growing again,
                    partly because of the recognition that the geopolitical problems and refugee
                    issues were still there; Indochina was still unstable; the Cambodian tragedy was
                    already occurring, etc. So getting back to your question, yes, I think the fact
                    that it was continuous is an important factor. I think another factor was that
                    the basic economic policy framework in Thailand from the early '50s to the
                    present, has been quite good: prudent macro-economic policies; a certain amount
                    of freedom to the private sector; not too much in the way of distortions; fairly
                    strong emphasis on physical infrastructure and on human resource development, at
                    least up through the primary level. All of those factors meant that the
                    assistance we provided, which was never massive, certainly not massive compared
                    to some places...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the highest level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The highest level was around $40-50 million a year. Over a forty year
                    period, the total amount of US assistance to Thailand was roughly $1.0 billion,
                    but if you divide that by forty, the average is $25 million a year. Given a
                    relatively proficient public administration and sensible enabling environment,
                    well-targeted, but modest, foreign assistance made significant catalytic
                    contributions to Thai development. However, some of our rural development and
                    decentralization efforts didn't accomplish much because the Thai Government
                    wasn't about to really decentralize government and give autonomy to the
                    provinces. So we cannot say that the entire program was great. But some efforts
                    were critical: namely, support for family planning; malaria control; and support
                    to other development-related institutions and for some physical infrastructure.
                    I would also emphasize the importance over the years of the USAID Participant
                    Training Program in Thailand. One analyst found that about sixty percent of the
                    450 most senior officials in the Thai Government had been the recipients of
                    USAID Participant Training Grants. This group includes Provincial Governors,
                    Permanent Secretaries, and Directors-General of Departments. I believe that kind
                    of assistance, relatively modest in financial terms, in a decent enabling
                    environment, had a profound impact on Thai development. It also paid major
                    dividends in terms of Thai-US relations. A lot of what I am saying is I think
                    expressed very well in a volume supported by both the USAID Mission and
                    Washington. The author, Bob Muscat, former USAID Chief Economist, was, during my
                    stay in Thailand, a senior advisor with the Thai National Economic and Social
                    Development Board. Muscat's book was published by Columbia University Press in
                    1990 under the title, The US and Thailand: Development, Security and Foreign
                    Aid.</p>

                <p>ERIKSSON: I would say so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, USAID support was instrumental in establishing Kasetsart
                    University , the agricultural university. We also helped to create the National
                    Development Administration Institute with a ten year grant (you know we don't
                    give many of these any more!), involving 50-60 faculty from the University of
                    Indiana . We also built the Medical School at Chang Mai University in Northern
                    Thailand, with technical assistance provided by the University of Illinois.
                    There are other examples.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes there is one; it is a note of human interest related to development
                    - human interest in the nature of governance in Thailand and the role of the
                    monarchy . It is a fairly activist royal family; they are committed to the
                    progress of the country and are revered by the populace. One daughter is very
                    close to the King and to the people; the only son is the crown prince. The
                    youngest daughter is a scientist who has a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry. Because
                    of the prominence of our program in the science and technology field, she became
                    aware of USAID, and I was invited to meet with her on several occasions. The
                    King learned about US expertise in an area of great interest to him: artificial
                    weather modification through cloud seeding . In fact, his cousin got a degree in
                    agriculture at the University of Maryland and had established a “Royal
                    Rainmaking Institute” in the Ministry of Agriculture. But the Institute had not
                    been very successful and the King, through the staff of this Institute, learned
                    about the US expertise. A request for assistance emerged from this interest,
                    which we were able to support from our “Emerging Problems of Development
                    Project.” We brought out a Bureau of Reclamation scientist from Denver, Dr.
                    Bernard Silverman, who is the leading US expert in the field of weather
                    modification. The King requested an audience with Silverman, to which I was
                    invited. The audience lasted over two hours. The first hour the King spoke
                    non-stop about his experience with weather modification, and the next hour was
                    basically a dialogue between Dr. Silverman and the King about various aspects of
                    weather modification, and what needed to be done to make the Rainmaking
                    Institute a more scientific and rigorous operation. The next couple of years we
                    provided modest technical assistance, stopping short of providing things like
                    aircraft that were prohibited by a ruling of the US National Security Council
                    (and which we could not afford in any event).</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, there was one. The scientist Princess was interested in our
                    support, including equipment and construction, for a new research institute
                    being built under her sponsorship. But we were in no position to do that. That
                    led to some strains and stresses in USAID's relationship with at least this
                    member of the royal family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Thai people generally in

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: On the whole, I liked it very much. My relationships were warm, cordial
                    and professional. But there is an “art” to working with Thais. A soft-spoken
                    style is appreciated. There was some unhappiness on the part of the Thais that
                    we were not more forthcoming at the beginning about our ideas for transition and
                    graduation. They learned about them a bit after the fact, and that led to some
                    strains and stresses in working relationships. Our original approach was not to
                    let them know, not to have them get upset. But things like that do get out; they
                    felt hurt that they were not involved earlier on. One of their reasons for being
                    upset was that they didn't see themselves being a candidate for “graduation.”
                    There was also some concern on their part that our strategy would lead the
                    Japanese to scale back their much larger assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in discussing new project ideas or
                        development ideas that most of the initiative came from your side or were
                        they pushing you all the time with new ideas or concepts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I would say it was both. We certainly initiated our own ideas and were
                    not afraid to raise policy issues, which the Japanese resisted doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And by and large they were reasonably responsive to these

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, although you sometimes had to approach policy dialogue gingerly.
                    But you could usually find someone who was prepared to talk with you. However,
                    getting something actually done or changed could take time and you did learn
                    that some issues were just “dead in the water.” In a couple of cases, I decided
                    to terminate projects, one of them, a decentralization project. We mutually
                    agreed to a deobligation, recognizing, with “no hard feelings” that we saw
                    things differently.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Basically pretty good. There was a little tension with the economic
                    section while I was there because of the trade issues that surfaced between the
                    US and Thailand, first with respect to rice and later regarding intellectual
                    property (copyrights, patents, software, etc.).</p>

                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: On the whole, good. I had for the most part first-rate people working
                    for me. Sure, there were some personnel problems, but nothing I would classify
                    as “disasters.” I would also like to note that we had some truly outstanding
                    Thai FSN professional staff. Professionals who could match the best US officers.
                    As our US Direct Hire staffing levels came down, we assigned full project
                    management responsibilities to several of our Thai FSN staff members.</p>
                <p>We also had some lovely times with staff, including a couple organized bus trips
                    with FSN staff to different parts of the country. It was at times like these
                    that the marvelous Thai sense of humor really came through - which is
                    encapsulated by the Thai word for “fun” - “sanuk!” And all staff -US and FSN-
                    really “came through” during critical periods, such as, our emergency assistance
                    response to deadly floods in Southern Thailand, relatively frequent “CODELs”
                    (visits to Thailand by US Congressional members), and a visit by the
                    Vice-President and Mrs. Quayle, when USAID was responsible for Mrs. Quayle's
                    program (about which she was highly complimentary).</p>

                </p>
                <p>A new role as the USAID Director of the Center for Development Information and
                    Evaluation</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: My next assignment was back in Washington after having completed two
                    tours in Thailand. I think we were ready to come back then. Our son had
                    graduated from high school and my wife was already thinking about other things
                    she wanted to be doing. PPC recruited me once again, this time to the job of
                    Director of the Center for Development Information and Evaluation (CDIE), a
                    prospect I found quite appealing. As soon as I got back I learned that several
                    people in the office had been hard at work putting together a proposal for an
                    “Administrator's Evaluation Initiative.” Waiting for me was a draft proposal
                    which called for more than a doubling (from 10 to 15) of the evaluation part of
                    CDIE, as well as embarking on some new activities: creating an Agency program
                    performance measurement system and undertaking systemic evaluations of
                    management and operational issues. I got involved in time to make my own input
                    to the proposal and to present it to the Administrator's Senior Staff, who
                    approved it. The Administrator issued a worldwide notice and cable at the end of
                    October 1990, and we were off and running.</p>
                <p>The first couple of years were pretty much consumed in writing organizational
                    statements, functional statements, position descriptions and trying to get them
                    approved. There were some significant programmatic accomplishments. The program
                    performance measurement system got well underway the first few years, including
                    a felicitous acronym for the system: “PRISM” (Program Performance Information
                    for Strategic Management) . The idea was a “prism:” a system with several
                    components that in the first instance would be “bottom-up” in that objectives
                    and performance measures would be developed at the field Mission level, and then
                    be aggregated to tell a world-wide picture, which could lead to shifts in
                    policies or resources by agency senior management. On the Program and Operations
                    Assessment side, however,...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you go into that: on the PRISM business, how is
                        that different from what was there before; was this a major change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Let me try to explain that. In one way it was a major change. It
                    actually grew out of earlier work in CDIE that started in the late '80s. A
                    series of CDIE field visits to selected Missions got CDIE involved, not just in
                    evaluations, but in strategic planning. These Mission Directors were asking what
                    kind of impact were Missions making in terms of doing something that was
                    significant for development? This led to CDIE sending out several teams to
                    places like India, Indonesia and couple of countries. The basic logic is that of
                    the “logframe” or “Logical Framework Matrix.” What is different about it is that
                    it goes to a higher level than just the project; it's at the program and overall
                    Mission program level plus the notion that with limited resources, the Mission
                    should seek to identify no more than two or three, or with a very large program
                    like Egypt four or five, “Strategic Objectives” for its entire program. A
                    “Strategic Objective” is defined as an objective which if accomplished, the
                    Mission will think it significant in terms of country development; yet the
                    Mission is also prepared to take a “manageable interest” in the Strategic
                    Objective. In other words, not total control, but some control and influence; so
                    that the Mission can claim with some credibility that its resources and efforts
                    in policy dialogue made a difference. There may be other donors involved and, of
                    course, the country itself contributes resources, but the Mission must believe
                    that at the Strategic Objective level its resources and efforts can make a
                    developmental difference. The resources might be several projects or only one
                    project. They could also be PL 480 Food Aid, commodity imports, research
                    studies, or the day-to-day policy dialogue conducted by the Mission Director and
                    other Mission staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the country's role in this process or was it
                        strictly a Mission phenomenon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's an interesting point. The Mission that did the best job with
                    PRISM brought the country into the process. However, that takes an investment of
                    effort, and it can take more time because of the backings and forthings. Also
                    host country counterparts may have different ideas from the Mission. Some
                    Mission Directors were impatient with that; they didn't see its usefulness as a
                    management tool for the Mission itself, but instead saw it as a
                    Washington-imposed requirement. In these cases, PRISM became exclusively a
                    Mission exercise. If, on the other hand, the government had bought into PRISM,
                    then the Mission had a strong rationale for turning down proposals that were not
                    consistent with the agreed strategy. We have examples of Missions that have used
                    PRISM that way, as well as to more sharply focus their program. In USAID Kenya ,
                    for example, they decided that given their resource limitations and the nature
                    of the country's problems, they had been trying to do too much, to cover too
                    many bases. So they made a decision to phase out their support for education and
                    human resources. That's not to say that in Kenya human resource development is
                    not a continuing priority for the government or the country, but that this is an
                    area that will be supported by other donors and/or the government, and that
                    USAID will concentrate on small enterprise, agriculture, and family planning,
                    the three Strategic Objectives that the Kenya Mission selected.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did this mean that Missions had a free hand to come up
                        with whatever objectives they wanted or how did they relate to what USAID
                        was concerned about and Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's a subsequent chapter. In comes the Clinton Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was not an issue at the time...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: While Missions were not operating in a total policy vacuum, there was
                    not strong and sustained policy leadership, for a variety of reasons, during the
                    six-year period between the administrations of Peter McPherson and Brian Atwood.
                    Our view in CDIE was that while it was important for PRISM to get started as a
                    bottom up proposition in order to get Mission ownership of it, it would also be
                    important for top management in Washington to see what was coming out of it and
                    make any adjustments if they wanted to. That never happened during the Roskens
                    administration ; partly because of turmoil in the administration and partly
                    because the PRISM system wasn't yet generating the kinds of worldwide results
                    that would enable senior management to use PRISM as a decision tool. But we felt
                    it was important that the initiative start from the bottom, rather than from the
                    top down because previous attempts in USAID at implementing performance
                    information systems tended to fall of their own dead weight; because they were
                    imposed from the top; something that Missions didn't “own;” something they
                    didn't see useful as a management tool for themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you are talking about aggregating it; how can you
                        aggregate something that didn't have any commonality?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: A serious issue. This really came to a head during the Atwood
                    Administration because both Atwood and Lancaster seized on PRISM as a way to
                    better convince Congress about USAID's performance. In some ways USAID was
                    “ahead of the curve” as far as the rest of the US Government is concerned. Why
                    do I say that? Because of two events: first, the National Performance Review
                    (NPR) under Vice-President Gore in 1992-93, which stressed measuring performance
                    outcomes not outputs or inputs; and second, the passage in August 1993 of the
                    Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) , co-sponsored by Senators Glenn
                    and Roth. The Administration embraced the 1993 GPRA, seeing its points of
                    tangency with the NPR. The GPRA calls for all US federal government agencies to
                    do strategic planning and to set out strategic objectives and measurable
                    performance indicators against those objectives. It reads almost like a PRISM
                    script; it is to be implemented over a five-year period. Those agencies that by
                    1998 or 1999 are judged to be doing a good job of strategic planning, including
                    performance measurement, will get greater flexibility from OMB to move their
                    budgetary resources across line items in order to accomplish objectives.
                    However, this poses a major challenge for programs as diverse as USAID's. The
                    challenge is precisely that of adding up, or aggregating across very diverse
                    country programs and objectives. Over the last two years the Administration has
                    become really concerned about this problem. There was major, “watershed” debate
                    in this regard among the senior staff about a year ago: had it gone one way, it
                    would have kissed the PRISM system “good bye” because it would have meant giving
                    up country programming by relatively autonomous USAID Missions by imposing
                    program targets from the top. There were some people who thought that every
                    Mission should be required to have a strategic objective in each of the four or
                    five Agency-wide goal areas (Population, Environment, Economic Growth,
                    Democracy, Humanitarian Assistance); whereas there were others of us who argued
                    that this was silly, that Missions ought to analyze their country in terms of
                    the five objectives, but then select those for programming where it made sense
                    in terms of what USAID could contribute, along with other donors and the host
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had to stay within the five?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, although they are pretty broad. So, that is more or less where
                    things stand now.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I forgot to mention that the “Evaluation Initiative” also called for an Annual
                    Program Performance Report, something called for by the GPRA, but which USAID
                    had never done before. Three such reports have now been prepared by CDIE, with
                    the current report being the most ambitious. The current report attempts to
                    paint a picture drawing on several sources, not just what is coming out of
                    PRISM, but also from both CDIE and Mission evaluations. And then telling what
                    steps have been taken as a result of that information. Regarding this last
                    point, CDIE sponsored a conference a year and half ago on PRISM, which included
                    participants from the Hill. I'll never forget one of the Committee staffers,
                    George Ingram, from the House International Relations Committee, who said: “You
                    know these numbers on program performance are all very nice, but that alone will
                    not do it; first of all, members of Congress like a brief, compelling narrative
                    story and secondly, you are not going to be credible if all you are feeding them
                    is success stories; they also want to hear what your failures are, how your
                    system has detected those failures and what you have done in response to those
                    failures, how you've changed things.” That's what CDIE tried to provide in this
                    year's Annual Report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess we have a good flavor of your views of PRISM. If
                        you want to add more later.. Let's move over to the operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Program and Operations Assessments . That had its own share of
                    accomplishments and frustrations. The satisfactions relate to some of the work
                    that was completed: evaluations on USAID's experience with support for export
                    and investment promotion programs; with support for rule of law and
                    administration of justice programs; and with support for child survival
                    programs.</p>
                <p>In the area of operations and management issues we took a systematic look at
                    USAID's in-country presence . It has long been an article of faith that country
                    presence is one of our comparative advantages, and yet it is quite expensive; it
                    costs a lot to put a resident direct hire person overseas. The evaluation sought
                    to answer what the essence of this advantage is, and what steps might be taken
                    to make it more cost effective. It was an interesting process, involving sending
                    teams of 4-5 people to eight countries. Two former Mission Directors, John
                    Koehring and Peter Askin, headed the teams. The basic conclusion was that the
                    core benefit derived from our overseas presence is in the programmatic and
                    policy area, in the day-to-day policy dialogue we conduct with counterparts on
                    substantive issues. The evaluation also concluded that as far as other functions
                    are concerned, they should be performed in less costly ways than by using
                    resident US direct-hire staff. The positions identified included those of
                    executive officer, legal officer, contract officer, and even program officer.
                    The basic proposal was to have a core US Direct-hire Mission consisting of a
                    principal officer plus one officer with a substantive background as well as
                    knowledge of USAID regulations and procedures for each strategic objective in
                    the Mission's strategic plan. Other functions would be performed electronically
                    through faxes and E-mail and/or by periodic TDYs from regional support offices
                    or Washington, and by greater use of FSN staff, and contracted local hire
                    staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the recommendation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: We had several meetings with the senior staff, and I presented the
                    findings to Brian Atwood when he was still Assistant Secretary of State for
                    Management. Some of the evaluation's recommendations are now being implemented
                    under the various agency “re-engineering” efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Earlier you talked about your role in defining the child
                        survival strategy and then you had a role in evaluating it. Apart from the
                        tensions that may have been created, given your previous relationship to the
                        subject, you said it was controversial. What was that about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Right. I thought it was an interesting and well done study, but I'll
                    tell you why it was controversial. Overall, it was quite positive about what had
                    been accomplished in the program. It followed CDIE's usual approach of six
                    country case studies and then a synthesis. It was most positive about what had
                    been achieved through support for immunizations; less so for oral rehydration
                    therapy, pointing out several instances where the rate of use of oral
                    rehydration had not gone up according to targets; the one major exception being
                    Egypt, where the record was pretty good. The study identified lack of attention
                    to education of mothers and promotional campaigns as being one of the factors
                    that was missing in programs that were less successful. The Health Office really
                    took umbrage at that. They were critical of our choice of countries for the case
                    studies; they argued that had CDIE chosen other countries, a somewhat different
                    picture would have emerged.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which six countries did you pick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Bolivia, Egypt, Haiti, Indonesia, Malawi and Morocco. In the case of
                    immunizations and oral rehydration therapy , we also had worldwide data although
                    the Health Office claimed there was a bias in these data as well. Another
                    controversial point was on acute respiratory infections (ARI) , which have in
                    recent years become quite a serious problem in developing countries.
                    Tuberculosis and pneumonia are major killers of children. The evaluation stated
                    that the record of USAID success in this latter area has not been very good; it
                    is an inherently difficult area and it involves finding a cost effective
                    approach to case management. There is no “magic bullet,” as in the case of
                    immunizations and oral rehydration therapy. We were challenged on this
                    conclusion by a new Atwood-recruited health expert, who claimed great success in
                    reducing ARI in a corner of Nepal.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>In retrospect, I think we could have managed the “vetting” of the evaluation
                    better than we did; we should have followed the approach we pursued with the
                    “Rule of Law” evaluation, where we held one or two large workshops and invited
                    USAID and outside participants to comment on the draft synthesis. We let them
                    all “say their piece” on the draft synthesis. Then it was still up to us to
                    decide what to include or not. That's critical to the credibility of an
                    evaluation; you get comments, but there is no clearance process as far as the
                    substance of the evaluation is concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an external panel to review the design of the
                        Child Survival evaluation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I wish we had. In fact, the “Evaluation Initiative” called for an
                    External Review Panel for each of the major evaluations that CDIE undertook; the
                    panel was to consist of three outside experts who had not previously consulted
                    on the projects being evaluated. They would first review the research design
                    paper for the evaluation before it was undertaken and then review a draft of the
                    synthesis. Although we had a couple outside experts review the Synthesis draft
                    of the Child Survival evaluation, the design and most of the country case
                    studies had been completed before the new External Review Panel system was in
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The other area you talked about was the rule of law; you
                        may not want to elaborate on that now but the question is: did the Agency
                        accept any of these evaluations and did you feel that they had any impact on
                        operations? You mentioned that some in the first instance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It's a mixed bag. The Child Survival evaluation had most of its impact
                    through the country case studies. By the time the synthesis came out, the Health
                    Office argued they were already doing what the evaluation had recommended. They
                    told Atwood that the evaluation was “too late.” Atwood remembered that comment
                    and quoted it several times when the subject of CDIE arose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: There is some truth in the observation. CDIE during my watch was very
                    slow in getting evaluations out - although in the last year or so I think the
                    record has been improving. But we tried to be serious about rigor, and there is
                    a trade-off between timeliness and rigor. However, in the case of the Child
                    Survival evaluation, the Health Office was seeing things pretty much from the
                    perspective of the projects managed by that office, rather than from the
                    perspective of the Missions, and their health programs. For example, while the
                    Health Office has recently developed a project financial sustainability issues,
                    none of the Mission programs that CDIE evaluated adequately addressed this set
                    of issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Another major question arises: how much responsibility does the evaluation office
                    have for its findings being utilized? I think it has some responsibility; it has
                    to identify topics that are of interest and relevant to management; it has to do
                    quality work; it has to caste its recommendations in actionable form. But then
                    at some point, some one else has to pick up the ball.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did the evaluation process have specific
                        recommendations that the Agency had to respond to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: We tried to make sure that recommendations were “actionable,” but what
                    do you mean by recommendations that the Agency “had to respond to”?
                    Historically, CDIE has depended on a “soft” approach, hoping that widespread
                    dissemination of its evaluations would lead to voluntary adoption of the
                    “lessons learned” and recommendations of its evaluations. One of the exceptions
                    was the export promotion evaluation. And here it was not CDIE, but the “AA for
                    Operations” in the Roskens Administration, Scott Spangler, who ordered a
                    portfolio review of Bureau projects to ensure they were consistent with the
                    recommendations of the CDIE evaluation. Unfortunately, this process got stopped
                    in its tracks by the transition to the new Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the whole question of implementing evaluation findings
                        is...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It's murky. In fact, it depends on how different administrations and
                    personalities are prepared to address that issue. I thought the recent model
                    represented by the interaction between Gary Hansen in CDIE and Larry Garber,
                    Atwood's Senior Policy Advisor on Democracy in PPC, on the “Rule of Law”
                    evaluation was one that should be emulated in the other areas. In this case,
                    Larry picked up the ball and has been developing guidance for the field that
                    draws heavily from the evaluation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have some more thoughts on the evaluation
                        topic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Just a couple. The way you put your last question: did the Agency
                    “have” to respond to evaluation recommendations? CDIE and PPC have talked about
                    asking for a report every six months from the operating bureaus on how they have
                    implemented CDIE evaluation recommendations. But, as of my retirement, no action
                    had been taken along these lines. There is an organizational “culture” in USAID
                    that mitigates against this approach. I wonder if, in the current dismal
                    political environment for foreign assistance, we can afford such an attitude any
                    longer. If such an approach were to be adopted, however, CDIE would probably be
                    viewed more like the “IG” (the Office of the Inspector General), which does ask
                    for a report within a certain time frame on implementation of their
                    recommendations. I know that some CDIE staff, who prefer the “softer” approach,
                    would not be happy with the IG approach. But I know of several other donors -the
                    World Bank, CIDA and the Asian Development Bank- that follow the latter
                    approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can come back to that in another way, but USAID had a
                        very decentralized evaluation system in the sense that what CDIE did was
                        expost or special studies. What was your relationship to the rest of the
                        evaluation system of the Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: CDIE has had the job of overseeing the evaluation system of the Agency
                    as a whole and in some sense providing quality control. Its responsibility is to
                    prepare the Evaluation Guidance for the Agency's Project Handbook. This is
                    intended to guide project evaluations undertaken by missions during project
                    implementation, or at the end of a project. The guidance was last issued in 1989
                    and is now in the process of being revised by CDIE. It has also been proposed
                    that CDIE ask Missions to do evaluations for a given year only on certain types
                    of projects, such as environment projects, and that they follow a common scope
                    of work and methodology for the questions to be addressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are on-going projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, on-going projects as well as end-of-project evaluations. This
                    approach could be quite powerful because the results of evaluations all
                    employing a common methodology should provide a much better basis for drawing
                    generalizations in a synthesis report than trying to generalize from the
                    current, very decentralized system. The problem with the current system is that
                    it is almost impossible to generalize from Mission evaluations when there is a
                    wide range of methodologies and types of questions being asked among Missions,
                    even for projects in the same sector. In fact, roughly every two years CDIE has
                    attempted to do a synthesis of Mission project evaluations completed during the
                    previous two years. It has not been possible to draw many generalizations from
                    such efforts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The common problem is having a database of information
                        that is reasonably consistent and compatible to be able to draw conclusions
                        beyond projects; is that the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. The challenge is to be able to draw conclusions from project
                    evaluations that will be of relevance and of interest to senior management. As I
                    have already indicated, too often by the time CDIE evaluations get to senior
                    management they are focusing on another problem. That is a perennial problem for
                    evaluation offices in any agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn a little bit now to one of the other dimensions
                        of evaluation: the learning process and how you, not just with
                        recommendations to senior management, but how you educate the Agency to
                        what's new or what works.. How did CDIE see its role in that and what was
                        the Development Information function from your point of view in that
                        relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: One initiative responding to your question is a recently inaugurated
                    “Evaluation Compendium” consisting of two-page summaries of key evaluation
                    findings and recommendations in each major subject or issue area. We have made
                    this Compendium available in loose-leaf and electronic forms. About 25 of a
                    planned total of 80 or 90 two-page summaries had been completed by the time I
                    retired.</p>
                <p>As far as CDIE's Development Information Division (DI) is concerned, we made a
                    conscious effort to make DI an integral part of CDIE, contributing to the CDIE
                    “Mission Statement:” to help make USAID a “learning organization;” “learning the
                    lessons of its experience.” For example, for the last few years, as another part
                    of the “Evaluation Initiative,” CDIE has issued an annual “Evaluation Agenda,”
                    which describes all the evaluation products that CDIE plans to undertake over
                    the next three years. This deliberately includes the “Issues Briefs” on newly
                    emerging issues, such as AIDS and Intellectual Property Rights, that research
                    information analysts in DI prepare. I do think that DI is a terrific resource
                    and it is unusual; I'm not aware of any other donor that has anything quite like
                    it. And as you know, it has several components: there is “Research and Reference
                    Services,” which provides in a pro-active, use- friendly way, answers to
                    questions on project design and implementation originating from Washington and
                    the field, drawing on their “Development Information System” of hard copies,
                    micro-fiche and electronic databases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that suggest to you about USAID as a learning
                        organization because the whole point of all this is to help improve the
                        quality of program performance...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It is very much a part of that. However, the CDIE concept has had its
                    critics. The head of the USAID Management Bureau believes that DI should be
                    moved out of CDIE and into the Global Bureau. After a lot of debate on his
                    proposal to break up CDIE, which included deliberations by an External Review
                    Panel I recruited to advise senior management on the issue, the Administrator
                    has decided that the decision will be deferred, to be reviewed again by senior
                    management after USAID makes its proposed physical relocation to the new
                    building in the Federal Triangle area.</p>
                <p>A reflection on 25 years in international development</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a good point to pause; at this stage in your
                        review. Since CDIE was your last assignment in USAID.. maybe it would be
                        useful now to think back, to reflect on the total experience of 25 years as
                        to how you reviewed your work with USAID; what were the frustrations,
                        problems with things that didn't go very well. And on the other hand, what
                        you thought was significant and accomplished in what you were associated
                        with; and what would be instructive for people to understand about foreign
                        assistance if they were to sit down and read this and say what do I need to
                        understand from somebody who has had such interesting roles in both policy
                        and operations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The public opinion polls show that USAID remains one of the most
                    misunderstood programs in the country. People just don't appreciate what has
                    been accomplished. I think part of the problem is that it's the failures and in
                    some cases, temporary, transitory failures, that catch the attention of the
                    media - and the public. And of course the disasters like Rwanda and Somalia, and
                    the misstatements of groups like the Heritage Foundation that claim that foreign
                    aid is pouring good money after bad. And of course, the gross misconception
                    about the amount of resources that people think is being devoted to aid; the
                    finding of a recent public opinion poll that 15 per cent of the Federal Budget
                    is going for foreign aid, but that people also think that spending 3 per cent
                    would be to o little, when we actually spend less than 1 per cent of budget on
                    foreign aid.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there is little recognition of the progress that has been made in
                    the developing world. There are some impressive statistics on the extent to
                    which infant mortality in the developing world has gone down and the extent to
                    which life expectancy has increased. Although it is hard to prove rigorously, I
                    am convinced that US bilateral development assistance, and US contributions to
                    multilateral agencies, have been essential to this progress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you classify.. how would you enumerate first
                        some of the successes that you were associated with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: That's a very daunting question. One of the reasons is because I
                    haven't had the breadth of field experience that many of my colleagues have had.
                    It more difficult to point to those kinds of examples. I can point to some
                    specific things country by country, but they are fairly micro in character. At a
                    broader level, and as we have already discussed, I do believe I helped keep the
                    “New Directions” legislative thrust from getting off on a tangent, off base by
                    focusing exclusively on the “poorest of the poor.” I take some credit for
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you think that balance is still more or less there?
                        Despite the winds of change and stresses and haulings to the left and right?
                        Most of USAID's work remains in that philosophy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. There is a statement relevant to your question in the House
                    Foreign Affairs Committee Report we have already discussed on implementation of
                    the “New Directions” legislation. The statement reads: “AID therefore supports
                    activities which directly benefit the poor majority or support, through
                    assistance in planning and institution building, LDC agencies that deal directly
                    with the problems of the poor majority. Almost invariably AID assistance would
                    reach the poor majority not “directly” from US advisors working with villagers
                    but through (a) public or private intermediary institutions, and (b) advice
                    leading to change in LDC policies which, in several ways, might improve benefits
                    to the poor (for example, policies which influence the availability of
                    opportunities -including employment- and the supply and cost of basic good and
                    services).” [p. 7, from source cited in full in fourth entry of the Bibliography
                    at the end of this Oral History.]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, I had a hand in it. Now, reading it 20 years later, I see very
                    little that could be improved on in that statement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me bring out another point: you talked about your role
                        in developing the first strategy statement for Child Survival. Obviously
                        some of that work had been going on before in immunization programs, but
                        would it be correct to say that the child survival initiative in which you
                        were involved in setting the strategy became a prime moving force in the
                        whole question of immunizations for children around the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes I do. I think the fact that the US got energetically involved and
                    exercised some leadership in this area was important to the program achieving
                    world-wide significance and bringing along some of the other bilateral donors.
                    Moreover, the US really led the way on promoting oral rehydration therapy as the
                    most cost-effective treatment of deadly diarrheal diseases.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The US was the largest source of funding for that
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Possibly. Of course, UNICEF would argue that its entire program was
                    directed to Child Survival. I don't recall how that compares with the Child
                    Survival component of USAID's program. Perhaps at one point, the USAID component
                    was larger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of UNICEF's funding came from the US?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Of course. If you count that, you could certainly say that the US was
                    the largest contributor to Child Survival programs, world-wide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there other programs, other sectors that you feel you
                        were associated with? What about the science and technology and development
                        research dimensions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: One thing I tried to do in the S&amp;T Bureau was to speak up for the
                    importance of socio-economic research and the interplay between socio-economic
                    research and bio-physical research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in your earlier work you were involved in the whole
                        equity issue and labor economics related to your earlier studies; and you
                        were writing policies on those. Did you get a sense of how they were seen in
                        the agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I would take some credit for promulgating concern and sensitivity to
                    employment problems in developing countries during those first five years, both
                    in USAID and in the donor community. I led several meetings on these themes at
                    the OECD's Development Assistance Committee in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the general feeling about working in USAID?
                        What were the pluses and minuses of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I really believe that it has been a privilege to have devoted 25 years
                    of my working life to USAID; to have served in the positions that I have; to
                    have been in on the ground floor of some very significant initiatives like
                    concern about employment and income distribution, child survival, the work on
                    the New Directions; and to have been in countries like Sri Lanka and Thailand,
                    each with their particular interest from a developmental point of view. And
                    last, but not least, to have been associated with CDIE. While all my assignments
                    had their frustrations, they were also very exciting and satisfying experiences,
                    particularly in working with first-rate colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you characterize the working environment as
                        might be compared with working for some other organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I would rate it very highly as compared with what I know of other
                    organizations. The personnel of other USG agencies experience some of the same
                    frustrations as USAID staff, including the frustrations involved in making
                    transitions to new political leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Changing administrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes. New teams who want to do things their own way. Every government
                    agency has to cope with that. On the other hand, I have the sense that while
                    there is some “deadwood” among USAID staff, there is less than in many other
                    federal agencies; that there has been a spirit of elan, dedication and
                    excitement about the work among USAID staff that is missing from the many other
                    agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an atmosphere where people with ideas and
                        creativity could operate or was it a deadening influence because of the
                        frustrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I think that in spite of the frustrations it was an atmosphere where
                    creativity and innovation have thrived. It is partly because of the nature of
                    the people who have been attracted to USAID, partly because of USAID's
                    decentralized nature and the degree of autonomy in the field missions, which
                    also leads to an environment where creativity can flourish. This also happens to
                    a certain extent in other federal agencies that have offices around the country.
                    These impressions are inevitably subjective, but they also are consistent with
                    those of other people with whom I have discussed this subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some people seem to suggest that the world in which USAID
                        operates is so much more complex because of the cross cultural and political
                        aspects than it is in any domestic program. Would you think that this is a
                        more complex situation in which to operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes I do. It has got to be. Not to say that domestic programs don't
                    encounter cultural diversity too; they certainly do. But I can't imagine they
                    approach the kind of diversity that different USAID Mission are operating in.
                    The other comparison you suggested in my mind is with the private sector. Here
                    one has to make a distinction between the for-profit private sector and the
                    not-for-profit private sector. In the for-profit private sector, the business
                    sector, I have never seen a potentially satisfying career for me. The overriding
                    imperative there is the bottom line: whatever turns a profit. Sure, I respond to
                    monetary incentives, and I like to see a bonus coming in my pay check. But I
                    have never seen that as being the overriding objective. Some people say that is
                    too harsh, that there are corporations with a social ethic, environmental
                    responsibility and so on. But when push comes to shove, profit is overriding.
                    However, I have sometimes wished I had worked for awhile in a non-profit
                    foundation, such as Ford or Rockefeller.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the private voluntary organization world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, a number of the PVOs have in recent years become quite
                    professional and development-oriented. So a stint with CARE or one of the others
                    could be quite satisfying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other overview comments at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: The field experience that one can get in an organization like USAID is
                    terrific. There is nothing that can substitute for the perspective and
                    understanding one can gain of a country; the host country relationships that one
                    forms; even a new perspective on dealing with the State Department and
                    Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you compare your overseas experience in the
                        USAID Foreign Service and being in the regular Foreign Service of the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: For me I much prefer USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Because of its mission for development and being the development arm of
                    the US Government. While being an Ambassador or DCM could be quite exciting, it
                    could also require supporting some aspects of US policy in which I am not all
                    that interested and perhaps with which I would disagree; trade policy, for
                    example. Also, it seemed to me that a major part of the work of Embassy FSOs is
                    reporting back to Washington. For me the intrinsic interest is the program
                    responsibility, and through fulfilling that program responsibility, seeing
                    development accomplishments in the country in which you are working.</p>
                <p>I'm concerned now about the serious talk on the Hill of USAID being merged into
                    the State Department, along with drastic budget cuts. I'm afraid that the kinds
                    of advantages, the innovativeness that exists in USAID, the commitment of its
                    people; some of this would be lost if the Agency were to be organically merged
                    into the State Department and in its budget cut by 20 percent or more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the major substantive loss, forget the
                        organization for the moment, by cutting or reorganizing or whatever? What is
                        at the heart of the process that you feel so important? How would you
                        characterize that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: At the heart of it is having relative autonomy in a broad policy
                    framework and sufficient resources to accomplish some meaningful development
                    objectives in the host country. My concern would be how these changes would be
                    implemented. For example, if the merger is done in a way that permits
                    “development” as a professional “cone” in the State Department Foreign Service
                    and gives development officers in the field some autonomy, then there is a
                    chance of preserving what I think is important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said something about wanting to be sure to preserve;
                        it wasn't clear what it is you are trying to preserve; apart from
                        organizational structure or development specialists. What is at the core of
                        what you are trying to preserve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: I could put it very simply: a bilateral assistance program that is
                    consistent with a broad definition of US foreign policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is it in the national interest to worry about
                        development?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>ERIKSSON: It gets back to national self- interest in one way or another. More
                    prosperous countries make better customers. Democracy and governance are part
                    and parcel of development. Democratic countries are by and large peaceful
                    countries; it's hard to come up with an example of a democracy that has declared
                    war on another democracy. More prosperous countries are better able to deal with
                    challenges that have global dimensions, like the environment and AIDS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What have been the major factors that have inhibited USAID
                        from being as successful as we all would have liked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: During the cold war we put resources into a country where we weren't
                    making a difference and in fact our resources were helping the country
                    misallocate resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political strategic factors figure in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ERIKSSON: Yes, they could be major factors.</p>
                <p>I'd like to conclude by briefly expressing one regret: namely, that my field
                    experience in USAID wasn't more extensive; in particular, I would have liked at
                    least one posting in Africa where the needs are the greatest. Now, in
                    retirement, I have some opportunity to at least partly redress the imbalance
                    through consulting, which I am already starting to do through work at the
                    African Development Bank in Abidjan, and through participation in a multi-donor
                    evaluation of emergency assistance to Rwanda.</p>
