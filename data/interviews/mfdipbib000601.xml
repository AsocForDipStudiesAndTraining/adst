                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry, I would like to begin this interview by having you
                        give us a little background of where you came from, what your experience and
                        education and background were before you came with USIA. From there, if you
                        will progress to what it was that attracted you to, or brought you into USIA
                        and then we will consider your various assignments. So why don't you take it
                        from there to begin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Lew, let me start off by saying this is my 37th wedding anniversary.
                    Margaret and I were married 37 years ago today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congratulations. I'm sorry I interfered with your
                        anniversary. I didn't know.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Biosketch</p>
                <p>KENDALL: It's a great occasion and I'm going to tape this interview myself for my
                    memoirs.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My background. I am a Louisiana farm boy, the fourth son and seventh of eight
                    children. My mother was widowed when I was only two years old so her father took
                    her and her children in and put them to work on his dairy farm to earn their
                    keep. We lived near Lake Charles in southwest Louisiana, and one of my chores
                    before school used to be delivering milk to homes around that town. My mother
                    taught school in a one-room rural school to earn money to buy books and clothes
                    for her children. I began school at the age of five, and she was my teacher. I
                    recall that she was much stricter with me than with the other children. When
                    Huey P. Long was elected governor of Louisiana, he provided free textbooks for
                    Louisiana's school children so my mother was relieved of that burden. He also
                    got the state legislature to consolidate the rural schools, including my
                    mother's, to improve the quality of education. I attended one called LaGrange
                    through both primary and high school, and graduated in 1936 at the age of 16
                    with eleven years of schooling. There were 26 students in my graduating class.
                    When I finished high school my family did not have enough money to send me to a
                    university so they sent me to business college to study bookkeeping and
                    shorthand, but I must confess I was not terribly inspired by the prospect of
                    that type of a career. After finishing, I floundered about a bit and then went
                    to work for an automobile parts house, first as a mechanics helper and then an
                    automobile parts salesman.</p>
                <p>1940: Entrance Into Army Air Corps</p>
                <p>In 1940 the U.S. Army Air Corps beckoned. As you know, it was the predecessor of
                    the U.S. Air Force. Congress had enacted a draft law that year. The draft board
                    was breathing down my neck, and I knew I would have to go sooner or later. I
                    thought it would be much more interesting to get into some technical aspect of
                    the Air Corps rather than carrying a rifle in the infantry. I had no ambition to
                    be a foot soldier. So I looked at the various possibilities, spoke to the local
                    army recruiter and asked him to let me know when he had an opening in the Air
                    Corps. Shortly afterwards he offered me a choice between being a mechanic in a
                    bomber squadron, a weather man or a radio operator for the AACS—the Army Airways
                    Communications Squadron—as it was called in those days and still is, though
                    acronym now stands for Airways and Air Communications Service.</p>
                <p>Pearl Harbor—WWII Experiences: 1941-1945</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I joined the army at the age of 20, went through the usual boot camp procedure,
                    and then was sent to a radio operators and mechanics school at Scott Field,
                    Illinois, near East St. Louis. Six months later I completed a course in Morse
                    code and was assigned to Eglin Air Base, Florida, a flight-gunnery training
                    school, as control tower operator; I was there at the time of Pearl Harbor and
                    took part in training the growing number of Air Corps cadets destined for combat
                    theaters in the European and Pacific theaters. One of the more memorable groups
                    was a B-25 bomber squadron led by then Colonel James Doolittle. I have vivid
                    recollections of watching the B-25's sitting on the end of the runway, flaps
                    down, revving up their engines at full speed for a quick takeoff, and then
                    seeing them jump into the air and wobble uncertainly until they reached a steady
                    flying speed. I also recall watching Colonel Doolittle fill out a flight plan
                    for San Francisco—an extraordinary distance for the short range B-25—and saying
                    to him, “Colonel, I don't know where you are heading, but I would be mighty
                    pleased to go with you.” He responded, “Thank you sergeant, I appreciate that,
                    but we are full complement now.” It was only when President Roosevelt announced
                    Doolittle's daring raid on Tokyo from an aircraft carrier that I realized I had
                    been involved in the preparations for a historic event in the early days of
                    World War II.</p>
                <p>This and other experiences persuaded me to apply for flight training school. I
                    was accepted, but as my flight instructor told me when I flunked a crucial
                    flight test, I was not cut out to be an army pilot. I was chagrined and not a
                    little unhappy about it at the time, but felt better after watching several of
                    my former classmates die in air crashes while training to fly the hot new B-26s.
                    I went back to being a control tower and radio operator and served at several
                    bases in the South until my name came up in June 1943 for overseas assignment. I
                    was back at Barksdale Field in Shreveport, Louisiana, at the time, and it was my
                    fortune to copy the message from headquarters shipping me and several of my
                    buddies overseas. We traveled by troop to San Bernardino, California, where we
                    underwent a brief period of survival training on how to escape a sinking ship.
                    At the time none of us knew where we were going, only that we would be headed
                    out across the Pacific somewhere. In early July some 6,000 of us shipped out of
                    Long Beach on a converted Italian luxury liner, the Conte de Bianco Mano,
                    renamed Hermitage, which had been confiscated from the Italian government with
                    which we were at war. To avoid Japanese submarines we traveled a zig-zag course
                    non stop to Wellington, New Zealand, and thence to Melbourne and Fremantle,
                    Australia, where we picked up a cruiser escort to Bombay. There we boarded a
                    British transport for Karachi, then part of India, and thence by C-47 (Douglas
                    DC-3) transport plane to Assam in Eastern India. After one night in the steaming
                    heat of Assam I was ready to move on. My chance came almost immediately and the
                    next morning I flew “over the hump” of the Himalayas aboard a converted B-24
                    bomber-transport plane to Kunming, China, where I became a part of General
                    Claire Chennault's famed Flying Tiger squadron, later the 14th Air Force.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>That was in September 1943. I worked there for a year as a radio operator sending
                    and receiving messages on the movement of U.S. air transport planes ferrying
                    supplies across the 'Hump” from India to China to supply the Chinese and
                    American forces fighting the Japanese. Our heavy work schedule gave us precious
                    little time to get acquainted with our Chinese environment, but I have vivid
                    recollections of infrequent excursions on foot into the picturesque Yunnan
                    countryside around Kunming. In November 1944 I was assigned, with five other
                    enlisted men—we were two radio operators and four weather observers—to a
                    radio/weather station in Lanzhou, Gansu province, located on the banks of the
                    Yellow River in northwest China, at the southern edge of the Gobi desert, not
                    far from the western end of China's Great Wall. Our task there was to provide
                    meteorological data which the U.S. Air Force in the Pacific needed for
                    forecasting the weather over Japan to facilitate bombing operations. We made all
                    our broadcast schedules but, unlike Kunming, we still had ample time between
                    broadcasts to get acquainted with the local citizenry and their culture. With
                    the help of an American trained teacher, a refugee from Eastern China, I was
                    able to learn enough spoken Chinese to communicate on a social level. One of my
                    most memorable experiences was a 10-day trip on the back end of a truck with a
                    group of Chinese to Kunlun, a Tibetan lamasery in Qinghai province. It was
                    during this period that I began thinking of my post-war career and saving up for
                    my university training. My service in China had opened up tremendous new vistas
                    and I was determined to make the most of them. Subsequently, the GI Bill of
                    Rights gave me and hundreds of thousands of other veterans an added bonus which
                    benefitted us, as well as our nation itself. Nevertheless, even though I became
                    acquainted with the Foreign Service through the American Consul in Lanzhou, a
                    man named Harry Stevens, I did not really envision a foreign service career for
                    myself until much later.</p>
                <p>Post-War: Education Via GI Bill</p>
                <p>After VJ Day the U.S. Air Force rapidly deactivated its installations in Western
                    China and I was shipped home via troopship through the Suez Canal and the
                    Atlantic Ocean. I'll never forget the thrill of seeing the Statue of Liberty as
                    we pulled into the New York harbor. Demobilization for me came in San Antonio,
                    Texas, on November 2, 1945. I entered Louisiana State University as a freshman
                    the following January. I was thinking of a career in science, but an aptitude
                    test they were giving young men at the time indicated I would do much better
                    working with words so I turned to journalism and political science. I did
                    relatively well in my undergraduate work, finishing in two and a half years at
                    the top of my class in May 1948. I went on to Yale for an MA in international
                    relations and from there to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for
                    Ph.D. work in political science. Ironically, one school term after I arrived,
                    the person I intended to study under at Chapel Hill transferred to Yale.</p>
                <p>Degree In Journalism And Newspaper Experiences Leads To Recruitment Into IIE,
                    USIA Predecessor, 1950</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>At that time I was torn between owning my own newspaper somewhere in the South or
                    a career in journalism as a foreign correspondent. But my GI Bill and my
                    patience with being a student ran out at about the same time so I applied for
                    and was accepted for a job as reporter for the Charlotte Observer (N.C.). This
                    was in August 1950. Earlier, in the spring of that year, a classmate of mine,
                    Stan Moss, who now lives in Novato, just north of San Francisco, said to me one
                    day, “Harry, I hear there are openings in the State Department for overseas
                    service. Why don't we go up and see what it's all about?</p>
                <p>I said, “Stan, I'm going to be a foreign correspondent. I'm not interested in
                    that.”</p>
                <p>But he persuaded me, and we went to Washington and were interviewed by officials
                    of the Institute of International Education, IIE, the predecessor of USIA.
                    Later, one of the officials came to Chapel Hill to talk to us, but there was no
                    commitment. Time passed and I sort of forgot about it, not knowing that State
                    was going through its security clearance process. I had no idea it would take
                    six months. During that period I had joined the Charlotte Observer and was
                    beginning to enjoy my budding journalistic career. Then one day in December 1950
                    while I was busily at work on a news story the phone rang and I was offered the
                    choice of Saigon or Caracas at a salary considerably above what I was making.
                    What a choice! Mind you this was long before anyone even thought about a Vietnam
                    War. I had lived among Latinos at the Pan American House at LSU. I felt I would
                    be comfortable with them. But I had also lived in Asia and had studied both
                    Chinese and Japanese government. In the end I chose Caracas for rather personal
                    reasons. I was engaged to Margaret and neither of us was ready for marriage at
                    the time. I figured that if I got as far away as Saigon I'd never get back to
                    get married.</p>
                <p>First Assignment: Caracas, Venezuela, Early 1951</p>
                <p>So I went to Caracas, and a year later, in December 1951, I went back to Chapel
                    Hill to claim my bride. Margaret has been with me ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any Spanish language at that time or did that
                        come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, I had studied Spanish as well as French as an undergraduate at LSU,
                    and I had done relatively well. I have a curious facility for languages. But I
                    had taken Far Eastern studies too and was interested in Asia because of my
                    wartime experience. Stan Moss had concentrated on Latin American studies. So, as
                    it wound up, Stan went to the Far East, to the Philippines, and I went to Latin
                    America. Eventually I got to the Far East, including Saigon, but that comes
                    later. But with my training and experience in journalism and my experience with
                    Spanish at LSU's Pan American House I had no qualms about going to Latin
                    America.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I got no additional training such as given to our present day junior officer
                    trainees. State was expanding its information services abroad and they needed us
                    badly. IIE gave me a 30 day orientation course at the Department of State and
                    then sent me off to Caracas. There, John Turner Reid was my public affairs
                    officer and a dear lady named Alice Stone was the cultural affairs officer. It
                    was a three man post, and I came in as an information assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was this now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I arrived in Venezuela on George Washington's birthday, February 22,
                    1951, and learned my first lesson in the Foreign Service. Never arrive at a new
                    post on a holiday. I landed at the Maiquetia airport on the coast. Caracas is
                    some 20-25 miles away in a valley at an altitude of 2,500 feet and access at
                    that time was along a narrow winding road through the mountains. Heavy rains the
                    night before had caused a landslide, so I had to take a shuttle plane from
                    Maiquetia up to the La Carlota airport in the Caracas Valley. Of course there
                    was no one there to meet me but there was a message telling me where to go.</p>
                <p>I spent four years—two tours of duty—in Caracas, one too many for a first post.
                    In December of that year I took two weeks leave and went back to Chapel Hill,
                    N.C. to be married. I tell people I didn't get a Ph.D. at Chapel Hill but I did
                    get an MRS. That was 37 years ago today. Margaret and I have been together ever
                    since and she has accompanied me to every post except Saigon, during the Vietnam
                    War when families were not permitted. We had our honeymoon in Haiti where I
                    spent my last cent and had to borrow money to wire my post to have a driver meet
                    us when we arrived back in Maiquetia.</p>
                <p>My objectives in Caracas were to be a good Foreign Service officer. I went in,
                    not as a FSO but as Foreign Service Staff. However, in 1952 I took the Foreign
                    Service exam and passed it. Just about that time John Foster Dulles let it be
                    known that USIA would be separated from the Department of State. Since I saw my
                    career as being more oriented toward the information and cultural rather than
                    the political, administrative and economic side of the Foreign Service, I set
                    aside my opportunity to become a State FSO and stayed with USIS. I have never
                    regretted the decision and thoroughly enjoyed my 29 years as a Foreign Service
                    Information Officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>My first assignment in Caracas, as information assistant, was to handle radio and
                    motion picture activities. Later I also assumed responsibility for the press
                    function. This was before the days of television, and we had a fairly large film
                    program with several mobile units roving the countryside giving outdoor showings
                    of USIS documentaries in working class neighborhoods. In retrospect, it seems
                    the ultimate luxury, but it was effective in its way. We also serviced a number
                    of radio stations with VOA supplied programs recorded on huge 16-inch platters
                    as well as locally produced news documentaries based on materials drawn from our
                    wireless file. I am uncertain what the term “wireless file” means to today's
                    information officers, but for us at that time it was a news and commentary
                    bulletin transmitted from Washington via Morse code. I felt close to it because
                    of my five years as a radio operator in the U.S. Air Force. However, I didn't
                    copy it myself. We hired a local employee to do that.</p>
                <p>USIS Caracas Had Almost Unhindered Access To Venezuelan Media</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask at this time. I've forgotten exactly when it
                        was that Perez Jimenez came to power. Was he in power at the time that you
                        were there? And if he was not, did you have full access to the radio
                        stations? Were they willing to take USIS material or did you have any
                        obstacles to overcome in trying to place yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, while I was there he took over power in a rigged election and
                    remained in power until he was overthrown several years after I left. Although
                    the Perez Jimenez government watched the news media carefully, its censorship
                    focused primarily on news that might affect its exercise of control. We had full
                    access to the press. They accepted our materials and used the international news
                    items extensively. This was the time of the Cold War and Venezuela was very much
                    on the American side. Perez Jimenez was a military man and strongly
                    anti-communist, so the anti-communist materials which came out of IPS and IBS
                    found a ready market with the Venezuelan news media which were encouraged by
                    their government to use it. As a matter of fact, some of the packaged,
                    anti-communist materials was so hard-line it sometimes made me gag.</p>
                <p>Besides finding a ready market for our media materials, we had full access to the
                    media operatives themselves. I was on a first name basis with practically every
                    press and radio journalist in Caracas. The Radio Broadcasters Association of
                    Venezuela invited me to their annual meetings, and I met with individual members
                    frequently, both officially and socially.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I started to tell you about a radio program we had called Revista Internacional,
                    or International News Magazine. We produced and recorded it weekly for
                    distribution throughout Venezuela. In looking for a personality to do the
                    program, I chose a young man named Renny Ottolina. He was just getting a start,
                    but partly through this program and, I guess, largely through his own ability
                    and ambition, he developed into the number one radio and television broadcaster
                    of Venezuela and remained in that position for many years. Eventually he ran for
                    president of the country. I would like to think that I helped him get started.
                    Unfortunately, during his campaign for the presidency, he was killed in an
                    airplane accident. It was a great tragedy. He was a very fine person of strong
                    moral character and great ability.</p>
                <p>But back to USIS in Caracas. We were housed in a very small building, an old
                    residence next to the Embassy in a section of town called San Bernardino,
                    adjacent to the old town of Caracas. John Turner Reid was succeeded by Joseph
                    McEvoy who had been an AP correspondent in Latin America for many years. He was
                    very well known and liked and was fluent in Spanish, but spoke with a pronounced
                    Irish-American accent. He is now retired and lives in Fort Lauderdale. Both he
                    and his wife Ann were wonderful persons with great senses of humor. We got along
                    splendidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he the PAO or was he the information officer at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: He was the PAO. I was by then the information officer. As I said
                    earlier, I stayed in Caracas for four years, which is unusual for a young man
                    just starting out his foreign service career. I'm glad that policy has changed
                    because it didn't do me any good to stay on that long. From a career standpoint,
                    I should have moved on to another post after two years. Yet, because of my long
                    experience at the post I became quite valuable to the program. I knew everybody
                    and everybody knew me. I had three PAOs while I was there—John Turner Reid, Joe
                    McEvoy, and then George Butler. Butler was a former ICA (International
                    Cooperation Agency, later AID) officer who had transferred to USIA.</p>
                <p>1955: Transfer To Takamatsu, Japan, But First—</p>
                <p>My transfer came up in May 1955, and I got my wish to go back to the Far East. I
                    was assigned to a post at Takamatsu, Japan. I had never heard of the place and
                    had to search for it on a map. By that time, Margaret and I had our first child,
                    a daughter born in Chapel Hill during home leave between my first and second
                    tour in Caracas. We named her Elizabeth Anne and called her Betsy.</p>

                    Values And Reservations</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now before we leave Caracas, however, you said that some
                        of the anti-communist material that was being delivered by the media units
                        from the USIA headquarters was pretty heavy stuff. Do you feel that any of
                        this was counterproductive in your programming there or did you cut out the
                        stuff that you thought was so strong that it really would be ridiculous to
                        put it out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: We tended to use most of it because the market was good. I recall
                    particularly the VOA dramatic programs. The Venezuelan radio stations loved
                    those dramas. They were done quite professionally by the VOA Spanish language
                    service and their quality was several cuts above anything available in
                    Venezuela. The radio stations liked them, partly because they were free and
                    partly because their public called in and asked for more. We also arranged a
                    number of direct VOA Spanish language news broadcast feeds. I don't recall how
                    many, but there was a significant number. We used the IPS press materials with
                    discretion, but with 20/20 hindsight I can't really say we were as discreet as
                    we might have been because we, too, were imbued with Cold War mentality. One
                    might even say victimized by it. In retrospect I should certainly have
                    eliminated some of the things that I used rather freely at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think that there was in the population of Caracas
                        and Venezuela, generally, people that were oriented toward an anti-communist
                        viewpoint, so that you were talking to a very substantial portion of the
                        population at that time which was skeptical about this kind of approach to
                        information activities? Did you have any kind of communist element active or
                        submerged within the country itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I would say that we had a receptive audience. There was not a strong
                    communist movement. The Perez Jimenez government would have made you believe
                    that there was. But not in Venezuela. They were a relatively unsophisticated
                    audience. We tended to take a broad, mass audience approach to programming
                    rather than the selective approach that we adopted later on. For example, at the
                    time we had mobile film units which would go out into the countryside for a
                    couple of weeks at a time with one or two operators and a good supply of USIS
                    documentary films. These programs were very well received.</p>
                <p>B. USIS's Two Main Goals In Venezuela</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they deal extensively with things that you felt would
                        help the Venezuelans understand the American culture and the American
                        educational background and, generally, what the Americans were like? Was
                        that your prime goal there in Venezuela?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KENDALL: We had two goals. One was to help our audience understand what the
                    Americans are like. The other was to educate them, because the literacy level,
                    the educational level in general, was really quite low. We designed most of our
                    programs for public education on non-controversial topics such as health and
                    culture with only a minor emphasis on political topics. In an evening's program,
                    for example, one could insert a brief political documentary film but if you did
                    more than that you would lose half your audience. As I was saying before, we
                    aimed at a broad audience rather than selected targeted audience groups that
                    became the programmatic approach of USIA later on. We had quite ample resources
                    at the time. In retrospect, I think we were probably given more than we could
                    use intelligently. But when we began shifting to a more targeted approach, we
                    did so at the expense of the mass educational type of program.</p>

                    Venezuela Of The Early 1950s</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the program of an educational nature
                        that you were putting out did help to orient the Venezuelans more in the
                        direction of the United States? And did you encounter any anti-American
                        feeling to speak of. If so was there anything that this might have countered
                        or did you just take what there was and find a receptive audience to help
                        you in presenting a point of view that perhaps got the Venezuelans more
                        acclimated to an American viewpoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Let's say they were strongly pro-American to begin with. We did not have
                    an antagonistic audience. This was in the early '50s. The United States was very
                    powerful world wide. We had just recently come out of the second world war as a
                    very strong nation.</p>
                <p>Venezuela was benefitting enormously from the American oil companies operating
                    there. The national income was on the rise and people were feeling good about
                    their future. The audience was generally very receptive. We did not have a
                    strong anti-American audience to contend with. In a sense, on the educated
                    level, we were speaking to the converted. On the lower level we were attempting
                    to elevate the educational level of the masses.</p>
                <p>Actually, we were doing what the national government should have been doing and
                    we were helping them out. In another sense, we were doing what ICA, the
                    International Cooperation Agency, did later when they became part of the
                    Alliance for Progress program under Kennedy and Johnson. We were doing a lot of
                    that work from the resources that we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I asked you about this possible anti-Americanism and
                        possible communist influence because not too long ago we inter- viewed Bob
                        Amerson who came to Venezuela shortly after you left. At that time the
                        communist influence was growing and there was a certain amount of
                        anti-Americanism which, based on his experiences, was beginning, he felt was
                        beginning, to arise. He was there during the fall of Perez Jimenez. I
                        wondered if that had existed when you first came and from what you say it
                        apparently didn't, but it arose later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Bob succeeded me in my job. Let's say there were occasional articles in
                    the press, occasional radio programs which indicated communist influences at
                    work. I recall one incident. I can speak rather freely because this old
                    gentleman involved has gone to his reward. His name was Ricardo Andreotti who
                    was our local press chief. Wonderful Italian gentleman he was and a prolific
                    writer. He was good at black hand letters. If he spotted an article in the press
                    or heard a radio program which he thought was communist tainted, he would send
                    an anonymous letter to that particular radio station or that newspaper saying
                    “We know what you're about. We listen to that program. We read that article.
                    Here are the facts.” And he would follow up with a point by point refutation of
                    the item in question.</p>
                <p>These were anonymous letters. They achieved their purpose. He was quite good at
                    it. And, as I said, a wonderful person to work with.</p>
                <p>So there was some of this, yes, but we didn't find anti-Americanism to be a great
                    problem while I was there. As Bob Amerson told you, the anti-Americanism did
                    grow out of reaction to the Perez Jimenez government because the United States
                    was seen to be supporting the dictator. So the U.S. took part of that blame. The
                    communists, of course, took advantage of this anti-government sentiment to gain
                    popular support.</p>
                <p>Bob experienced this problem more than I because he was in Venezuela later on
                    during the reign of the dictator. I was there during the early stages while the
                    authoritarian government of Perez Jimenez was bringing some order out of the
                    previous government's chaos and enjoyed a certain amount of popular favor.
                    Later, governmental abuses increased and that favor dwindled and changed into
                    outright antagonism.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You indicated that you had another little episode about
                        Caracas that you would like to talk about before we go onto the Japanese
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, it had to do with the binational center, the Centro
                    Venezolano-Americano. It was located in the center of old Caracas, right next to
                    the Plaza Bolivar, and was run by Fred Drew who was at that time a binational
                    center grantee. Fred had desperately needed a new location for his center and
                    was encountering problems finding a place to relocate. Finally he decided to
                    choose a suitable area, select an appropriate building, and then negotiate a
                    price for it. There were a number of old colonial homes in the city center so he
                    selected several possibilities and went around knocking on doors. At one door he
                    asked the lady of the house if the place was for sale, and she replied, “Yes,
                    how did you know? We just decided this evening.”</p>
                <p>The house had a large patio after the fashion of traditional Venezuelan homes and
                    this served as a stage for public programs. The Centro had a sizable clientele
                    of young Venezuelans who came there to study English. Working with Fred, I
                    developed an interamerican folk dance program which drew on the many Latin
                    American ethnic groups from around the continent resident in Caracas. We would
                    invite the various cultural groups from around Caracas—Argentines, Chileans,
                    Brazilians, Peruvians, Mexicans, and even Spaniards from the Canary Islands. All
                    seemed to have their own folk dance groups and all were happy to participate in
                    our program. Renny Ottolina, whom I mentioned earlier, served as master of
                    ceremonies. He had a way of animating groups that brought everyone in the
                    audience into the program. Initially we thought it would be just a small program
                    for our own entertainment, but it turned out to be bigger than the Centro could
                    handle, and we found ourselves renting the Teatro Nacional, the biggest theater
                    in town, which filled to overflowing with enthusiastic audiences. It was an
                    interesting and exciting experience for me.</p>
                <p>I also belonged to an organization called The International House which served as
                    co-sponsor. It consisted of a small group of Columbia University alumni who had
                    lived in the International House at that university. I hadn't, but they adopted
                    me. So this International House group, the Centro Venezolano-Americano, and
                    various other cultural groups around the city were involved. We had a tremendous
                    time and brought quite a bit of credit and popularity to the binational center
                    and our own International House group. Now, what good we did in terms of
                    inter-American relations, I can only guess. One can't evaluate these things, but
                    I know they generated a lot of good will and were fun to put on. I thoroughly
                    enjoyed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a matter of fact, I feel, that if you have an American
                        institution which is producing this kind of thing and it becomes highly
                        popular and the USIA program is identified with it, I feel it's a great plus
                        because I don't look upon the information program as just simply
                        informational media oriented. I look upon it as a combined, interacting
                        program. If you developed something that was of high value to the people in
                        the country, entertainment, which to them was a demonstration of their
                        cultural ability, and yet which they associated with American sponsorship, I
                        think that's all to the good. I don't think you have to go out and beat the
                        bushes all the time with a strong, pro-American or anti-communist theme. I
                        think it does a lot of good.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, this one did promote a strong sense of inter-Americanism, the sense
                    that the people of all of the Americas, both North and South were brothers and
                    sisters under the skin. The cultural differences were there to be appreciated,
                    but they didn't divide, they sort of brought us together. That was one program I
                    was very fond of. I guess it did take away from some of my other duties, but we
                    had a great time. Fred Drew spoke of the programs as the Centro's best during
                    his term as director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you have what was basically a pro-American or at
                        least a non anti-American population to deal with in those times, something
                        like this which did promote a feeling of interrelationship among the
                        American peoples, I think was no loss to devote a bit of your time to what
                        otherwise would gone to some more stringent and virulent anti-communist
                        activity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Or writing reports to Washington.</p>
                <p>Back To Takamatsu: Director Of USIS Cultural Center, September 1955</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, especially writing reports to Washington. Let's get
                        back to Japan now. What were you doing in Takamatsu, and let's hear a little
                        bit about that program. You were there quite a while as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Lew, you had a hand in it, so you would know as well as I. When my time
                    came up for transfer from Caracas I wrote to Kitty Jones, our personnel officer
                    in Washington, and told her Japan would be my first preference for my next
                    overseas assignment. Then lo and behold, she found a Japan position for me. You
                    remember Kitty Jones. She was a charming lady who took good care of all of the
                    USIS Foreign Service types at that time. She wrote me that there was an opening
                    as director of a binational center in Takamatsu. It was the capital of Kagawa
                    prefecture and the principal city on the island of Shikoku. I had never heard of
                    the place, but I was ready and willing to go.</p>
                <p>We, Margaret and I and our then two-and-a-half year old daughter Betsy—left
                    Caracas in May, 1955, for home leave and transfer to Japan. We traveled surface
                    all the way, by ship from the port of La Guaira to Mobile, Alabama, thence by
                    rail and car to New Orleans where we bought a Pontiac station wagon to take with
                    us. It turned out to be too long for Shikoku's one lane roads, but we managed
                    anyway. We drove that car to see my mother in Lake Charles, thence to Chapel
                    Hill, North Carolina, to visit Margaret's mother, then to Washington, D.C. for
                    consultation, and 18 days across country to San Francisco where we took it with
                    us aboard the President Cleveland bound for Yokohama. From Tokyo we traveled by
                    train to Kobe and thence to Takamatsu by the old Kansai Kisen ferry. I didn't
                    realize it at the time, but never again during my whole time in the Foreign
                    Service was I to have such a leisurely home leave and transfer.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>As I learned in Tokyo, Governor Masanori Kaneko or Kagawa prefecture, had gone to
                    Tokyo to request an American director for the center. When the U.S. Army turned
                    over their CEI-SCAP (Civil Information and Education-Supreme Command Allied
                    Powers) libraries to USIS at the end of the occupation, USIS had converted the
                    Takamatsu library into a binational center and given operational responsibility
                    to the Kagawa prefectural government. In effect, they gave the prefecture a good
                    sized library but no librarian to run it, as the Army had provided. The Governor
                    had found the library very useful in helping his constituents learn about the
                    United States and had been very cooperative in its operation. He wanted another
                    American director and wanted one badly.</p>
                <p>I am sure you are familiar with the problem because you were the executive
                    officer for USIS Tokyo at the time. Kaneko had approached you and the PAO on the
                    matter, and as a result Kitty Jones was asked to send a young American officer.
                    I guess that's essence of it. My application for a post in Japan hit Kitty's
                    desk in Washington about the time your request came in, so I was tapped for the
                    job. That's how these things come about I suppose.</p>
                <p>I regret I wasn't given any special training for Japan. I went there without
                    knowing the first word of Japanese. So the first thing I did was to get myself a
                    tutor and started learning Japanese. I took daily lessons while I was there. I
                    would not say that I became proficient, but when I left I did an interview in
                    Japanese with the local radio station.</p>
                <p>My job was to run a cultural center. There was some connection with what I had
                    been doing in Caracas, but not much. In Caracas I had been an information
                    officer. Here I was to be a cultural affairs officer. It was a general purpose
                    post, and, as I understood it, my job was to help bring American culture to the
                    Japanese hinterland. They were an eager group wanting to learn more.</p>
                <p>Takamatsu had been about 95 percent destroyed during one massive U.S. Air Force
                    raid on July 4, 1945, and the whole city had burned down. The place was poverty
                    stricken. The inhabitants were in the process of rebuilding the city and they
                    worked very hard at it.</p>
                <p>But they still wanted American culture. They wanted to know what Americans were
                    thinking, what they were doing, and how they could get to know Americans and the
                    United States better. Much has been written about the psychological aspects of
                    post-war Japanese attitudes toward the United States, but for me there at that
                    time it meant being confronted by people who saw their future as being aligned
                    with the national which had resoundingly beaten them in war and they urgently
                    wanted more information about that nation and its people. My job was to provide
                    it for them as best I could with the resources available. I had a staff of
                    Japanese employees who were on the payroll of the Kagawa Prefectural Government.
                    USIS gave me a vehicle and a driver, but other than that I worked entirely with
                    the Japanese staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interested. When did you get to Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I arrived there in September 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why. Originally when we started, we paid the whole
                        Japanese staff. We simply took them over from the Army and put them on our
                        payroll. I think the man who had been in Takamatsu was an Army employee and
                        actually stayed on for a while; I'm not certain now, but I think he stayed a
                        year or two. Initially we took over 24 of those cultural centers. It was
                        about 1953 and '54 that Washington began to retrench in the program in
                        Japan, and they said you've got to convert anywhere from six to ten of those
                        centers to a binational status. I guess that had happened just prior to your
                        arrival, and that's why at that time we were not paying the staff of the
                        center. It had passed over to prefectural payroll, and they probably got
                        less money than they did under us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Regenerating The Center Program</p>
                <p>KENDALL: They got considerably less. As a matter of fact it was a real
                    hand-to-mouth existence for them. But they were loyal, they worked hard, they
                    accepted my direction, and at the same time they took me in hand and led me
                    through the intricacies of Japanese culture and government. I was a willing
                    student. I'm not sure I was a very good student, but I was willing.</p>
                <p>We had a staff of about ten persons to operate our library, cultural and film
                    programs. The prefecture inherited the old CIE/USIS film library and all of the
                    projectors. These materials, equipment, and the library itself became part of
                    the Japan-America Cultural Center. Governor Kaneko looked upon me, a U.S.
                    Government official, as a means for getting more U.S. oriented material into
                    that library—more books, more USIS programs, more speakers, more visiting
                    artists.</p>
                <p>My title was Provincial Public Affairs Officer. I worked under the supervision of
                    the Regional Public Affairs Officer at the American Consulate General in Kobe,
                    first Jerry Novick, then Clifton B. Forster. The RPAO had supervisory
                    responsibility for the seven Kansai region centers—Osaka, Kyoto, Matsuyama,
                    Hiroshima, Takamatsu, and Nagashima. Clif had a lovely secretary, Melita
                    Schmidt, whom he called “Snow White” and he used to refer to us as the Seven
                    Dwarfs. It wasn't very flattering, but Melita made up for the difference by
                    taking care of the needs of the more isolated “dwarfs” such as myself by keeping
                    us supplied with basic necessities from the Kobe Army PX and commissary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Kyoto was still under the Kansai. I don't remember
                        whether the Okayama center had ceased to exist?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>KENDALL: The Okayama CIE library was converted to a BNC under the city
                    government, but it was never very active. They lacked a Governor Kaneko. Jerry
                    Novick and then Clif Forster had supervisory responsibility for regional
                    operations, and it was my job to work up my own programs, with the RPAO
                    channeling what support he could to me and the other provincial posts. My
                    programs were very scant at first. Later on we got a system working whereby Clif
                    sent us some first rate Japanese lecturers he was scheduling around the region
                    and occasionally an American lecturer. That was before our AMPART (American
                    Participant) program got into full swing. We made good use of those who came our
                    way.</p>
                <p>We also had some visiting artists. One of the more interesting was an American
                    Indian, or Native American as we now say, named Tom Two Arrows, who did Indian
                    folk dances. He was a big hit. Then there was a musician, a harmonica player,
                    named John Sebastian. He was another big hit for a very special reason. The
                    Japanese in the immediate post-war era were trying to reestablish music
                    education in the schools, but they had very little to work with. Governor Kaneko
                    had persuaded the school board to equip the schools with harmonicas, which were
                    very inexpensive, and so each school had its own children's harmonica orchestra.
                    When John Sebastian came to town with his harmonica, playing both classical and
                    popular music, he was met with an outpouring of enthusiasm by teachers and
                    children alike. The schools brought out all their children to hear him. It was a
                    touching thing, particularly when the children honored the visiting artist with
                    a return concert. These were some of the few types of performing artists we were
                    able to get out there in the boonies.</p>
                <p>Assistance To Matsuyama Center On West End of Shikoku</p>
                <p>These few programs were not enough to satisfy the demand for information about
                    the U.S., so I made a point of getting around to the various towns and villages
                    in Shikoku. There were two Centers on the island, mine and the American Cultural
                    Center in Matsuyama, down in Ehime Prefecture, one of the 14 you mentioned. My
                    Takamatsu territory included Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures; Matsuyama's
                    included Ehime and Kochi prefecture. For an interim period between directors at
                    the Matsuyama Center I commuted there once a week to supervise that program. The
                    trip was four hours by train, pulled by an old coal burning locomotive, and I
                    would always need a bath to wash off the coal dust when I reached my
                    destination. In Matsuyama the American Cultural Center had a studio apartment
                    above the library, but there was no bath in it and so I would go to the public
                    bath at Dogo Hot Springs for a good soak in their mineral waters, always a
                    pleasant experience. Whenever I had to escort an American visitor for some
                    program or other I would stay in a Japanese royokan in the Dogo area. In those
                    days when the exchange was 360 yen to the dollar you could do this without it
                    costing an arm and a leg. In the evening the maids would come around and ask you
                    what you would have for breakfast the next morning. No matter what you ordered
                    it was always ham and eggs. I recall going by the kitchen one night with some
                    visitors after an evening on the town and seeing our breakfast ham and eggs all
                    cooked and ready to be served the next morning. Very efficient, these
                    Japanese.</p>

                <p>My assistant at the Takamatsu Japan-America Center, the Nichi-Bei Bunka Kaikan as
                    it was called, was Kaoru Nishimura, a minuscule person about five feet tall. He
                    was a waif of a man with a good Japanese education, an excellent command of
                    English, and a bountiful supply of common sense. He enjoyed the confidence of
                    the Governor and had a good rapport with members of the prefectural government
                    bureaucracy. Even though he had served with the Japanese army in Manchuria
                    during the war, he was a very unmilitary man. He was head of the Japanese staff
                    and served as my interpreter and teacher. We became very good friends and remain
                    so to this day.</p>
                <p>Development Of The Japan-America Forum Program On Shikoku</p>
                <p>One day, driving from Tokushima to Takamatsu, Nishimura-san and I stopped at a
                    noodle shop for lunch, and a conversation with the owner gave us an idea for a
                    program we could conduct without the necessity of outside resources which were
                    not very abundant anyway. The shop owner, who seemed to be an educated man,
                    complained to us that the people of his town— the mayor, the school teachers,
                    and many others were eager for contact with Americans, people they could talk to
                    and learn more about the United States which was exercising such an important
                    influence on their lives. The kind of questions he asked matched those I had
                    encountered in earlier discussions with my Japanese contacts, and I felt I could
                    handle them just as well as any lecturer who might be riding the USIS circuit.
                    So out of that conversation we developed the concept for a Japan-America Forum
                    using myself, and my wife as principals and Mr. Nishimura as interpreter. During
                    the course of the next year and a half we met with community leaders in cities
                    and towns all over Shikoku.</p>
                <p>Nishimura-san organized them and arranged advance promotion. He would sketch out
                    an itinerary for us and, working through the prefectural government, he would
                    get in touch with the mayors or some other local leader in each town and ask
                    them to organize the local intelligentsia—usually high school teachers,
                    principals, or professionals for a morning or afternoon session of about two
                    hours. On the given day we would meet with the group in the town hall, sip
                    Japanese tea as we are doing here today, warm our hands over a hibachi, and talk
                    about things American and things Japanese.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>They wanted to know a lot about American customs. Margaret was with me and the
                    women invariably asked her questions about American family life. One even asked
                    how she could get away from her family to go on that trip with me. Answer: a
                    reliable Japanese amah. The questions concerned American education—mostly
                    primary and secondary but also about American universities—about local
                    government, social customs, enormous numbers of questions. None of them were
                    particularly difficult, but they showed a keen interest as well as wide
                    curiosity about the nation that had conquered them. I remember one delicate
                    situation in Tokushima prefecture where racism in the United States had become
                    an issue. We were going through out usual routine, answering questions about
                    education and schooling, and after each exchange one or more of a group of young
                    men would say, “Well, what about the people in Alabama? What about Selma? What
                    about the discrimination against the Negro?”</p>
                <p>This was the period when the struggle for civil rights was going on in the South.
                    Martin Luther King was leading demonstrators and organizing sit-ins against
                    racial discrimination. We could not ignore them and tried to respond as
                    factually as possible. After some time I said “Well, you know, we are not alone.
                    Racism is not confined to any one country. You have problems with it right here
                    in this country with the ETA (the people who work with leather, with dead
                    animals). They do not enjoy the rights of other Japanese citizens.” Later,
                    Nishimura-san said to me, “You know, I didn't translate that bit. It wouldn't
                    have done any good. They've got an Eta village right in this town.”
                    Nevertheless, despite this rare, negative reaction, we found our Japan-American
                    forums to be one of our most valuable experiences while we were in Shikoku.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do I understand that you were conducting these forums in
                        each of several locations throughout the island of Shikoku? Was there any
                        time in which you brought a much larger forum group and had a program
                        centrally in the cultural center there? Or was this just a series you did by
                        going around to different parts of the island?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Primarily it was programming myself and my wife because we didn't have
                    other resources. We had similar programs with larger groups in the center with
                    visiting lecturers when we were able to get them. The major thrust of this
                    particular program was taking ourselves south to the towns and villages to meet
                    with local leaders. This wasn't a mass program. It was a selective program for
                    local leaders—mayors, school principals, school board members, high school
                    teachers, and prominent local citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have materials about America that you could
                        distribute after you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: We had some, not very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose most of it was in English so it was not really
                        useful to them anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>KENDALL: That is correct. However, we were able to use English materials with the
                    English teachers association on Shikoku. They maintained very close contact with
                    us because we were a source of assistance to them in their own programs. They
                    very often came to our center to get such materials as we had. We brought in
                    Fulbright teachers of English or conduct English teaching seminars and then
                    spend several days giving teaching demonstrations at our center itself and in
                    their individual schools.</p>
                <p>The Great Impact Of U.S. Cultural Attach�, Glen Shaw On USIS Programming</p>
                <p>One person who came on various occasions was Glen Shaw, the USIS cultural attach�
                    in Tokyo. He was a real cultural treasure. As a matter of fact, the Japanese
                    named him a cultural treasure of Japan. He had first gone to Japan in the 1930s
                    and had become thoroughly immersed in Japanese literature and culture and spoke
                    fluent Japanese. At one time he was a columnist for the Asahi Newspapers. You
                    must certainly remember him. He was a tall, gangling man. He must have been six
                    feet six. I recall that his first visit while we were there was to help
                    inaugurate a statue of the writer Kikuchikan in the center of Takamatsu.
                    Kikuchikan was a native son of Takamatsu, and Glen Shaw had translated several
                    of his plays and poems into English.</p>
                <p>After the ceremony at the statue Governor Kaneko took Shaw and me on a trip
                    around Kagawa prefecture, stopping at sites of particular interest—a fish farm,
                    a pearl growing industry, temples, and spots of scenic beauty. The Japanese like
                    to have their guests sign visitors' registers and Shaw would compose a haiku for
                    each occasion. His signature in Japanese was a brush profile of himself. He was
                    a man full of good humor who charmed everyone he met. I also recall that when he
                    boarded the overnight ferry for Kobe, Governor Kaneko asked him how he was going
                    to fit his lanky self into one of the five-foot bunks in the sleeping
                    compartment. Shaw replied, “Well, I'm just going to curl up like a snake and
                    sleep all the way to Kobe.” Wonderful guy. He returned later for a series of
                    lectures on American literature and culture.</p>
                <p>Governor Kaneko's Exchange Grant To Visit USA, And Its Long Range Results</p>
                <p>These were some of the events that highlighted our stay in Takamatsu. There was
                    another of which I feel very proud. It has to do with the “leader grant”
                    program, now called the international visitors program, in which local leaders
                    are invited to the United States to see how we live and to get a better
                    understanding of how the U.S. functions. I persuaded Walt Nicols who was then
                    our field supervisor in Tokyo to arrange a leader grant for Governor Kaneko.
                    Until that time it had been against USIS policy to award leader grants to
                    Japanese government officials, but Kaneko was such an unusual person a decision
                    was made to make an exception and invite him.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Governor Kaneko came to the U.S. for three months and then went to Brazil for
                    another couple of weeks to visit some of the many Kagawa prefecture people who
                    had migrated there in the immediate post-war years. He came back to Takamatsu
                    brimming over with new ideas for improving the quality of life in his
                    prefecture. He told me then and has repeated it many times since that his vision
                    as a boy was to have a bridge over the Seto Inland Sea, the Seto Naikai. But, he
                    said, he had never imagined that Japan would be able to build such a bridge
                    until he had seen the Golden Gate Bridge and the Oakland Bay Bridge and the one
                    over the Verrazano Narrows. He returned to Japan with the vision of using
                    American technology to build a bridge across the Inland Sea. He said, “As I
                    stood there looking at that Golden Gate Bridge and at the Oakland Bay Bridge, I
                    said to myself, if the Americans can do it, we can too.”</p>
                <p>Shortly after returning from his visit to the U.S. Kaneko began a campaign to get
                    his dream bridge built, and it eventually developed into three bridges. The most
                    important one insofar as Kaneko was concerned, of course, was the bridge from
                    Okayama to Sakaide City near Takamatsu. Margaret and I were pleased to attend
                    the inauguration of the Seto Ohashi (Great Seto Bridge) on April 8, 1988.
                    Unfortunately, Kaneko was in the hospital at the time and could not attend the
                    ceremonies, but he still reveled in the glory of the occasion. Unfortunately,
                    the bridge will probably change the rural nature of Shikoku forever.
                    Nevertheless, Kaneko felt his dream had finally been accomplished and he gave me
                    full credit for helping him to realize it.</p>
                <p>Kaneko's visit to the United States also inspired him to other achievements in
                    which I take some pleasure. He visited various museums designed by Frank Lloyd
                    Wright and had one built in Kagawa using Wright's concept of designing the
                    architecture to meld in which the landscape. In New York he met Isamu Noguchi,
                    the Japanese-American sculptor who died recently. On seeing some of Noguchi's
                    stone sculpture Kaneko said, “Well, you know, we have some very fine
                    stonecutters in Kagawa, but all they are doing now is making gravestones. Maybe
                    you could teach them some of your kind of art.” He invited Noguchi out to
                    Takamatsu, and today there is a very fine studio a few miles from that city
                    producing some of Noguchi's best artistic stone sculpture. So these are some of
                    the intercultural exchanges we developed about which I feel a certain sense of
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>In 1957 the word came that USIS was undergoing another budget reduction and would
                    have to close one of its centers. My center in Takamatsu got the axe. This,
                    incidentally came about at the hands of Lyndon B. Johnson, then Senate Majority
                    Leader, as a reaction to some rather indiscreet remarks about the Democrats made
                    by the director of USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Arthur Larson, who gave a speech before the Young
                        Republicans Club in Honolulu shortly before he was appointed Director of
                        USIA. He made the remark that during the Democratic years, for 20 years, the
                        United States government had been under an “alien influence”. Now that the
                        Eisenhower administration had come into power that was going to be
                        corrected. Lyndon Johnson was not only Majority Leader but also the Nominal
                        Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, which ran Foreign Service
                        appropriations. So Lyndon Johnson took Larson to great task the first time
                        he appeared before the Appropriations Committee, and USIA got its budget cut
                        something like 25 or 30 percent. It took us about six years to get back from
                        that debacle.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: One of the results was the closure of my center. That hurt to the quick,
                    but I was compensated by my new assignment. I had done a pretty decent job in
                    Takamatsu, and my reward was Madrid. Joe McEvoy, my former PAO in Caracas, was
                    now PAO in Madrid. He told our personnel office in Washington that he would like
                    to have me join him. So the Agency cut out one good post and gave me another. In
                    effect, they made me an offer I could not refuse.</p>
                <p>Reminiscences Of Accomplishments While In Takamatsu</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Harry, earlier we were discussing some of the additional
                        things that came your way as a result of your assignment to Takamatsu. I
                        think they are very significant because this was Japan at a time when it was
                        just recovering from the war. Even ten years after the war it hadn't really
                        recovered its own vision of where it belonged and what it wanted to do. What
                        you have been discussing, I think, was a great contribution to the American
                        help that was given Japan. I would now like to ask you to review a few of
                        the things that we talked about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A. Role In Assisting Establishment Of Successful Best Sugar Growing In
                    Shikoku</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KENDALL: I was the only American official on Shikoku. There were two young
                    enlisted men from the Army's Criminal Investigation Division, the CID, who stuck
                    pretty much to their headquarters. But since I was the only public official,
                    Japanese private citizens and public functionaries who needed help from the
                    United States Government would come to me as their first point of contact. For
                    example, the prefectural chief of agriculture for Kagawa, a man named Irimajiri,
                    was trying to expand local sugar beet production. He said they didn't have any
                    dollar exchange and they didn't have access to American sugar beet producers or
                    their technology. Would I, he asked, be so good as to help them out. Mind you,
                    there was no U.S. agricultural official there, no one else for him to turn to,
                    so he naturally came to me. Basically what he wanted was various types of seed
                    he could use for his own agricultural experiments. So, with the assistance of
                    the Embassy's agricultural attach� in Tokyo, I obtained a list of American seeds
                    houses, wrote directly to them, sent them my personal check, and got him his
                    beet seeds. Of course he reimbursed me in yen. But he used the seed very
                    diligently and was able to improve the prefectural beet production. He took me
                    out to his agricultural experiment station on various occasions to show me what
                    was happening. Naturally I was pleased and felt rewarded for my efforts. We have
                    heard from Mr. and Mrs. Irimajiri at Christmas every year since then, more than
                    30 years.</p>
                <p>B. Assisting In Expanding Tokushima Prefecture Lumber Production</p>
                <p>On another occasion, the governor of Tokushima sent two of his forestry
                    specialists to seek my assistance in expanding that prefecture's lumber
                    production through the introduction of new varieties of pine. Now, I knew
                    nothing about the lumber business, but their problem was lack of access to
                    information on who to contact in the U.S. They needed seed catalogs. They didn't
                    really know who to talk with or to write to in the United States. Would I please
                    help? Again with the help of the Embassy agricultural attach�, I wrote to the
                    seed companies and got them the seed catalogs. They selected the varieties they
                    wanted, and since they didn't have any foreign exchange either—imagine Japan not
                    having foreign exchange!—I again sent off my personal check and got them their
                    seeds. When I was preparing to leave Takamatsu in 1957, the governor of
                    Tokushima sent his representatives over to Takamatsu with a beautiful bamboo
                    carving of the typical Tokushima dance figures—the Awa Odori-which I have to
                    this day. It is a beautiful piece that my wife and I treasure very much.</p>
                <p>C. Ironically—Helping Japanese To Improve Exports Activity</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>On another occasion the Embassy informed me that they were sending a commercial
                    trade mission to Shikoku to work with Japanese businessmen and government
                    officials and asked me to organize groups in Ehime and Kagawa prefectures to
                    meet with them. I went to the governor of each prefecture and enlisted their
                    assistance in organizing these officials and businessmen. The purpose was—and I
                    laugh about it to this day—to teach the Japanese how to export to the United
                    States. I would say that perhaps we were talking when we should have been
                    listening. But the mission was simply fulfilling the U.S. policy of helping the
                    Japanese get back on their economic feet. They learned their lesson well,
                    perhaps too well.</p>
                <p>Those were some of the things that came my way. Another thing I did, and this has
                    nothing to do with being an official American, just that I was an American
                    there, was to serve as judge for English-speaking contests conducted by the
                    Japanese schools. I am sure you have done that many, many times. These were
                    public performances which we did as part of our official presence there. It was
                    fun, we enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>To this day, when my wife and I go back to Takamatsu, we find that our friends,
                    the people we met and worked with 30 years ago, are still there and they still
                    remember us. We feel very good about that. During those 30 years Shikoku has
                    changed from being a collection of poverty stricken, backwater prefectures to a
                    very prosperous island. It's really beautiful, what the people have done with
                    their hard work. They learned their lessons well and their work has paid off. We
                    have returned for two and three day visits a number of times, and I feel good
                    about going back because I think we were able to contribute something when they
                    needed it most.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that Japan has changed tremendously since your and
                        my day there. But in the trips which you have made back, although there is a
                        lot of anti-Americanism in various parts of Japan, do you have the sense
                        that perhaps it's less virulent or less demonstrative in the Shikoku area
                        than it is elsewhere? Or do you find a good deal of it there? Or haven't you
                        really been able to judge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: My trips back have been just for a few days at a time. In 1975, twenty
                    years after we left Takamatsu, we returned to Japan for a second tour of duty,
                    this time in Tokyo, and made several visits to Shikoku to see old friends. We
                    have been back three or four times since I retired from the Foreign Service at
                    the end of 1979. Generally, these visits have been managed by our friends in the
                    way Japanese manage visits—with every minute scheduled, and my contacts have
                    been invariably friendly. If there is any anti-Americanism present on Shikoku, I
                    have not personally encountered it, though I do recall that on our last visit we
                    saw a poster in Matsuyama protesting the importation of American beef and citrus
                    fruits, a product of Japan-American trade competition.</p>

                    Officer</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>We left Shikoku September 1957, almost exactly two years after we had arrived,
                    having learned to speak some Japanese, or at least enough to get along. By that
                    time we had a second child, Nancy, born at the Yodogawa Clinic in Osaka in 1956.
                    She was now nearly a year old. Governor Kaneko and a large group of people—there
                    must have been several hundred—came to the Takamatsu pier to see us off and I
                    can still visualize the mass of colorful streamers between the pier and the
                    ferry as we pulled away to the tune of the 'Old Lang Syne.' It was a tearful
                    time. Our beloved amah, Eiko-san accompanied us to Tokyo to look after our two
                    children while Margaret and I enjoyed some of the sights there before abandoning
                    Japan for Spain. We made the return trip across the Pacific in a lumbering old
                    Boeing Stratocruiser, from Tokyo to Wake Island, to Honolulu and then to San
                    Francisco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The old stratocruiser that had the bar in the belly of the
                        plane?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, oh, that was a marvelous airplane. It took us 17 hours to make the
                    trip, but we enjoyed every minute of it. We took a train across country to St.
                    Louis and Indianapolis where we bought a car, a 1957 Ford Fairlane (we had sold
                    our Pontiac station wagon in Takamatsu) and then drove on to Washington for
                    consultation and then to North Carolina and Louisiana to visit our respective
                    families before leaving for Spain and our new assignment.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Madrid in November 1957. There was no language problem. My Spanish
                    had become quite fluent in Caracas and I was able to move easily into Spanish
                    circles. We had a much larger staff than in Caracas. It was not as large as the
                    one in Tokyo, of course. I think at the time you and I were in Japan there were
                    about 60 USIS officer in the country. In Spain, I think we had about 20,
                    including the branch posts. I worked in the information section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your PAO at that time?</hi>

                <p>Extensive Cooperation With U.S. Air Force In Improving Understanding Between USAF
                    Bases Personnel And Spanish Local Residence</p>
                <p>KENDALL: Joe McEvoy was PAO. Joe had been transferred from Caracas to Madrid and
                    he'd asked that I be assigned there when my transfer came up. Jack Higgins was
                    information officer. He handled press, radio, and such television as there was
                    at that time. I took on films and exhibits. I had a staff of about half a dozen
                    people in each section and tried, successfully as it developed, to combine the
                    two into a working unit in support of my major effort during my three-year tour
                    in Spain, a community relations project carried out in conjunction with the U.S.
                    Air Force.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Under the Spanish American Bases Agreement the U.S. Air Force had established a
                    number of bases around Spain; the U.S. Navy had one in Rota. The Air Force was
                    encountering public relations problems out in the provinces where they had set
                    up aircraft control and warning (AC&amp;W) stations. There were about a dozen of
                    these sites around the country, often in isolated areas, each staffed by about
                    90 to 100 men who lived on base or nearby with their families. The sites had
                    been selected for technical and strategic reasons without regard to cultural or
                    other considerations such as the proximity of a major city. Their presence in
                    rural, unsophisticated areas was creating public relations problems because the
                    local citizens simply didn't understand why the Americans were there or what
                    their purpose was. Some thought the installations were nuclear weapons sites.
                    Their most prominent aspects were two large radar antenna which would go around
                    and around or up and down. The Spaniards referred to them “la loca y la tona,”
                    the crazy one and the foolish one.</p>
                <p>Successful Development Of “American Week” Programs In Conjunction With Local
                    Spanish Authorities</p>
                <p>Most of the American personnel manning the stations had no training in the
                    Spanish language or culture. Even their officers had minimal contact with the
                    Spanish public or even with the officials. My job was to develop a community
                    action program to promote more personal contacts between the American personnel
                    and the people in the communities where they lived. After some consideration we
                    decided to use a program technique called “American Weeks” that had proven
                    popular on previous occasions in Spain. These would be based on a combination of
                    exhibits, films, lectures, and such cultural performances as we could organize.
                    We prepared a large photographic exhibit on the work of the U. S. Air Force at
                    the AC&amp;W sites and exhibits on different aspects of American life and
                    culture, science and industry that would convey an idea of what the American
                    people were like in their own country.</p>
                <p>We put on week-long programs in conjunction with local Spanish authorities in
                    provincial capitals, at regional and national fairs, at universities and at city
                    halls. The U.S. Air Force assigned a Spanish speaking officer to work with me
                    and loaned me the Air Force Band for a number of the programs. I recruited
                    lecturers from the Embassy and from visiting American scholars. I even
                    programmed myself with lectures on American movies and a slide lecture on the
                    history of American painting combined with an Agency-provided exhibit on the
                    same subject. My wife, an artist, was amused by my audacity because I had never
                    had any formal training in art, but I took an Agency prepared lecture,
                    translated it into Spanish, and sallied boldly forth. Of course I was careful to
                    let the pictures speak for themselves and never allowed time for discussion. One
                    of our more interesting art exhibits was a collection of original works by
                    American artists resident in Spain. I still have several pieces in my personal
                    collection presented me by participating artists who were grateful for the
                    exposure.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I don't recall how many of these American Weeks we put on, but I have the feeling
                    that I conducted programs in almost every province in Spain during the three
                    years I was assigned there. I felt very good about them because I got to know
                    many of the local cultural and political leaders. You don't get on a first name
                    basis as easily in Spain as in the U.S. It's a much more formal culture, but I
                    got to know many leading Spanish personalities quite well and was able to
                    conduct these programs wherever it seemed necessary.</p>
                <p>Perhaps I ought to say briefly how we went about it. If we found a problem in a
                    particular area, say, in Zaragoza where the U.S. Air Force had a major base, I
                    would go to the major of the city and explain our purpose and the type of
                    program we proposed. Then, working with his people, we would develop a week's
                    schedule revolving around our exhibits, some kind of program each day—a lecture,
                    a film showing, a concert—culminating with an open house at the American base
                    where the public would get guided tours of the facilities conducted by Spanish
                    speaking American personnel. These programs generally produced a sense of good
                    feeling or, at least, a better understanding of what the Americans were doing
                    there and why.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any indication afterwards that any of
                        the locally assigned Americans were continuing their contacts with the
                        Spanish after you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, on frequent occasions they did. Some of them came to me and said,
                    “Say, I really enjoyed that. I got to know the mayor. I had never known him
                    before.” Also, on return visits some of the Spanish authorities would go out of
                    their way to compliment me on the programs and tell me how much they had
                    improved Spanish-American community relations. My Air Force counterpart, a major
                    from Puerto Rico, also kept in touch with the base personnel and told me that
                    things improved noticeably after our American Week programs.</p>
                <p>In addition to the U.S. Air Force base programs we also conducted American Weeks
                    in some of Spain's ancient cultural centers such as Salamanca, Sevilla,
                    Villareal, and Valencia. One would really have to be jaded not to have his spine
                    tingle a bit at the thought of lecturing in site as steeped in culture as the
                    University of Salamanca.</p>
                <p>Successful “Atoms For Peace” Exhibits In Spain</p>
                <p>One of our more successful exhibits, and this is interesting in retrospect, was
                    on atoms for peace. You will recall that we had an “Atoms for Peace” exhibit in
                    Japan too, and that our really big coup was showing it in the Atomic Bomb Museum
                    of Hiroshima. In Spain we showed the “Atoms for Peace” exhibit in four major
                    cities—Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, and Sevilla. In those days we promoted atoms
                    for peace with vigor, if in ignorance of developments yet to come, and I think
                    we tended to oversell. At least we showed what the Americans thought atomic
                    energy could do. This was President Eisenhower's special program, and we worked
                    very hard at it.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We didn't know nearly enough about nuclear energy in those days. We were driven
                    by visions of a great new energy resource unhampered by the knowledge of the
                    problems of nuclear radiation and residue facing us today. Nevertheless, we
                    looked upon it as a good program, and I enjoyed working with it during my three
                    years in Spain.</p>
                <p>I should note that this was during the Franco era. He was at the height of his
                    power when I arrived in November 1957 and was still in control when I left at
                    the end of 1960. I recall watching the parade put on by the government on the
                    25th anniversary of Franco's assumption of taking power. Their slogan was “On to
                    another 25 years!” Working under a dictatorship such as Franco's has its
                    limitations, one of which can be the illusion of accomplishment in a system
                    where the major sources of information are closely controlled, but I thought we
                    did very creditable work.</p>
                <p>You asked me about the Public Affairs Officer. When I arrived Joe McEvoy was my
                    PAO. He was succeeded by Frank Oram who was there when I left. You remember
                    Frank?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know him. He was my boss at one time when I was
                        deputy director for Latin America. I've heard a lot of stories about Frank.
                        Was Jake Canter there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, Jake was our cultural affairs officer. Wonderful person. Jake took
                    over from John Turner Reid who was also there when I arrived. So in Spain I
                    worked under both my previous bosses in Caracas, John Turner Reid and Joe
                    McEvoy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you're supposed to be the one being interviewed, but
                        the reason I asked you about Jake is because the reason he was there was
                        something I got very deeply involved in. I'll take a few minutes to explain
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Please do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jake was cultural officer in Mexico and he was doing an
                        exceedingly excellent job. He had all the bigwigs of Mexico practically in

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>The ambassador was Bob Hill, who was a political ambassador and trying to run for
                    Congress from Mexico City. He took a great dislike to Jake. He came up to see
                    Frank Oram who was my boss as head of Latin America and I was the deputy. He
                    said, “I've got to get this guy Canter out of there. He's just too arrogant.
                    Whenever I talk to him he tilts back his head and sort of flares his nostrils,
                    acts as if you've got a bad smell around. I just don't want him there. He's a
                    detriment to the program. So you've got to come down and tell him he has to
                    leave.”</p>
                <p>I was the guy who had to go down and tell Jake that he was persona non grata with
                    the ambassador. We had to take him out of there and move him to Spain which was
                    a great benefit to Jake in the long run but it was a terribly embarrassing
                    situation at the time.</p>
                <p>On the night that I was there preceding the day I had to tell him this, we had
                    some visiting American attraction. I've forgotten, I think it was a symphony
                    orchestra or at least a musical presentation of some kind. Jake had practically
                    everybody of any consequence in Mexico City there and the ambassador was sort of
                    taking a second place. I could see why immediately. Everybody greeted Jake, and
                    the ambassador didn't know two-thirds of these people. Anyway that's how Jake
                    ended up as being the cultural attach� in Spain at a time when otherwise he
                    would have been another year and a half in Mexico City. Bob Hill is dead now.
                    There were a lot of stories about him as ambassador in various places, but we
                    won't go into that.</p>
                <p>KENDALL: Thank you for sending us Jake, because he was a wonderful person to work
                    with, a good personal friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That habit is still with him. He still tilts back his head
                        and sort of looks this way and that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It may be a hearing problem. I don't hear well in my right ear and I
                    turn my left ear toward the speaker, but that only means I'm listening more
                    closely. As you say, these are personal idiosyncrasies and I think it's rather
                    small of an ambassador to take personal offense at a thing like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the offense was not at that. That was simply
                        something he devised as a means of getting rid of Jake. He was really
                        jealous of the man because Jake was doing much more than he was.</hi>

                <p>Kendall's Contacts Throughout Spain During His Extensive “American Weeks” Travels
                    Highly Valuable To U. S. Embassy Generally</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KENDALL: But let me tell you that not everyone is like that. As I said, I had a
                    great many contacts throughout Spain. My ambassador at the time was John Davis
                    Lodge whom you know well. He and the chief of the political section, whose name
                    I don't remember at the moment, wanted to get a better handle on preparations
                    for local elections which were then under way. They didn't know the local mayors
                    so they came to me for help.</p>
                <p>“You know, Harry,” the political officer said, “I want to meet the mayor of
                    Almeria and Villareal and several other places. Do you know these people?” I
                    said, “Yes, I'd be happy to introduce you.”</p>
                <p>So they took advantage of my contacts. Ambassador Lodge was very helpful. He had
                    his own idiosyncrasies which I won't go into, but he did recognize that some of
                    his staff had knowledge and contacts which were quite useful to him. He took
                    advantage of them.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you an amusing story about Ambassador Lodge's wife, Francesca
                    Braggioti de Lodge, as they called her in Spain. She was a dog lover and was
                    intensely interested in a program for seeing eye dogs. There were a lot of stray
                    dogs on the streets of Madrid, and she had an idea that she could use them in
                    her seeing-eye-dog program. At this time the Spaniards had not yet developed a
                    program to help remedy this situation and set about an education program to tell
                    Spanish social workers about it. So on frequent occasions she asked me to get
                    documentary films on American seeing-eye-dog training programs.</p>
                <p>We would show these films in the USIS auditorium and Mrs. Lodge would enter the
                    auditorium in grand style with two or three dogs in tow. Knowing the Lodges was
                    an interesting experience. They were movie types, public entertainment types. As
                    you know, John Davis Lodge was a former movie actor and governor of Connecticut
                    who was appointed ambassador to Spain by President Eisenhower. In his staff
                    meetings he occasionally referred to his wife's affinity for dogs by remarking,
                    “A dog's life? In my house dogs live a wonderful life.”</p>
                <p>As a result of these activities I became rather close to Mrs. Lodge. I served her
                    purpose and she appreciated it. When I got ready to leave Madrid Mrs. Lodge
                    asked her husband to hold an official lunch in my honor. She told me to invite
                    anyone I wanted to, up to 22 people. So I invited a number of my Spanish
                    friends. She had a very formal, very lovely lunch at the Embassy residence.
                    Ambassador Lodge gave a little toast in my honor to which I responded, and then
                    Francesca said, “Mr. Kendall, I don't normally give toasts at these luncheons
                    but because you have been so helpful to me I want to say the dogs of Madrid will
                    miss you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dog days in the afternoon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Those are some of the little episodes that make life in the Foreign
                    Service more enjoyable, more entertaining.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we have covered Spain. You left Spain then in 1960
                        and where did you go from there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: At that time I had been overseas for ten years. Three posts, Caracas,
                    Takamatsu and then Madrid. I was offered another tour of duty in Spain but I
                    felt that I really needed to get back to the United States to get myself
                    re-Americanized. I should note here that our third daughter, Judy, was born in
                    1959 while we were in Spain, giving us an American, a Japanese, and a Spaniard,
                    so to speak.1961: Washington, USIA LIaison Officer With NASA, Working In NASA
                    Public Information Office</p>
                <p>We were assigned to Washington and arrived there at the very beginning of the
                    Kennedy Administration. I had asked for a job in the policy division, PP&amp;R,
                    Policy Plans and Research, as it was know then. Someone was needed to serve as
                    liaison with NASA which was putting together its Project Mercury team and was
                    becoming more and more important in our overseas information activities. Hal
                    Goodwin was the Agency's science advisor and when my name came before him he
                    asked Walt Nichols, our former field supervisor in Tokyo, whether I would be
                    able to act independently without the necessity for close supervision. Walt gave
                    me a strong recommendation on the basis of my record in Shikoku, and I was
                    assigned to work in the public information office at NASA headquarters which was
                    then located in the Dolly Madison House just off Lafayette Square. Later we
                    moved over to the Department of Education building on Independence Avenue. I
                    worked there from January 1961 to March 1964, slightly over three years.</p>
                <p>While with NASA I traipsed back and forth from Washington to Cape Canaveral,
                    holding hands with the foreign press that came to cover the space launchings
                    from “Ham” (a chimpanzee) up through the end of the Mercury program and into the
                    beginning of the Gemini program. My primary role, however, was keeping USIA
                    media informed about forthcoming developments within the space program,
                    assisting them in coverage of major events and in adapting NASA's information
                    output to our Washington and field requirements. Of course, I also tried to
                    educate the NASA information staff about their tremendous overseas audience and
                    the potential for reaching them through USIA. Since they had no one experienced
                    in handling the foreign press I fulfilled that function for them. I also made it
                    a point to be always available as a prime point of contact between USIA and NASA
                    personnel in arranging programs and handling special requests from overseas
                    posts. Of course, when I went there I knew nothing about space exploration, but
                    I soon became a space addict and developed a broad knowledge of the scientific
                    and manned aspects of the U. S. space program that carried over into my next two
                    overseas posts. It was an exciting and rewarding Washington assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>In 1963 I enrolled in the State Department's mid-career course with the idea of
                    going back to Asia. I had gone to the East Asia division and had been assured
                    that I would be sent to Laos as information officer. That pleased me, so I
                    focused on Southeast Asia in my studies at the mid-career course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the mid-career course at FSI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It was an intensive three-months course, concentrating primarily on area
                    studies, similar to but not as broad ranging as the Senior Seminar. It was
                    useful. Unfortunately, when I finished I found that the position at Laos had
                    been closed out, so there I was with my Southeast Asia training and no place to
                    go. I went back to NASA for a while pending an assignment. The Kennedy
                    assassination came about while I was at FSI.</p>
                <p>1964: Information Officer—USIS Panama</p>
                <p>In January 1964, during the early days of the Johnson Administration, there was a
                    diplomatic break with Panama, our USIS library was burned, and all of the USIS
                    Panama staff except the PAO was dispersed. Then in March, when relations were
                    suddenly resumed, the Agency needed an information officer quickly. So with my
                    Latin American experience I was nabbed and sent to Panama as IO.</p>
                <p>President Johnson selected Jack Vaughn as ambassador to go to Panama to pick up
                    the pieces. During this vice-presidential travels he had met Vaughn in some
                    small country in Africa, Chad, I believe, where Jack was chief of an AID
                    mission. Vaughn had impressed Johnson as a very gutsy guy. He'd been to school
                    in Mexico, earning his way through the university as a prize fighter. He spoke a
                    very fluent, very colloquial Spanish.</p>
                <p>I worked with Carl Davis as PAO getting the post back on its feet. After about a
                    year Carl was transferred to Washington as head of VOA's Latin American Service.
                    He was succeeded by Hoyt Ware who had spent most of his career with the
                    Associated Press in Latin America, mostly Brazil, and spoke Spanish with a
                    pronounced Portuguese accent.</p>
                <p>The major U.S. presence in the area was the Panama Canal Company and the U.S.
                    military. We met regularly with their information officers to coordinate our
                    activities. Of course, I did the usual routine with press, radio, television,
                    and motion pictures. We put a lot of effort into promoting the Alliance for
                    Progress which was the principal emphasis of both the Kennedy and the Johnson
                    administrations.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I spent three years in Panama. I continued the practice I had developed in my
                    three previous posts of getting around the country a lot. I always felt that
                    getting out into the country and meeting people helps to convey a better sense
                    of the United States through personal contact, answering questions, asking them,
                    bringing the information media to bear on specific problems that I encountered.
                    It also gives you a much better understanding of the country and its people than
                    you get from staying in the capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the period during the Lyndon Johnson era when
                        Johnson was trying to bring about some kind of a reconciliation on the
                        disenchantment of the Panamanians with the Panama Canal Authority and I
                        suppose that coincided with your period there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Basically, as you may recall, in early January of '64 there were flag
                    incidents in the Panama Canal Zone which irritated the Panamanians quite a bit.
                    There had been a tacit agreement that the schools in the Zone would fly both the
                    American and Panamanian flags. The American students in Balboa High objected to
                    flying the Panamanian flag and took it down. That inspired a Panamanian mob,
                    many of them students too, to invade the Zone which is just across the street
                    from Panama City's main thoroughfare. They tore down the American flags from in
                    front of Balboa High and other schools and burned them. In the melee that
                    followed several Panamanian students lost their lives and this led the
                    Panamanian government to break relations with the U.S. Emotions soared on both
                    sides and there was a lot of very hard feeling. So much of the work that I had
                    to do during my first year in Panama was in assuaging animosities in the
                    Panamanian public. We did this in various ways. One of them was investing a lot
                    of AID money in building schools and roads and hospitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time you were supporting the Alliance for Progress
                        with information?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes. Unfortunately, this alliance turned out to be more a U.S. aid
                    program than an alliance. Although the Panamanian government did participate
                    rather actively in these programs their resources were limited and all too often
                    the projects became handout programs on the part of the United States rather
                    than jointly financed, jointly conducted programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that after that very serious feeling of
                        antipathy toward the U.S. that there was some diminution of that—that
                        animosities had died down, or was there still a continuing undertow of
                        antipathy towards the United States afterward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It died down, but the Panamanians have always had a love-hate feeling
                    toward the United States since the time the Panama Canal was first built, since
                    Teddy Roosevelt took Panama.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Made them a country by taking it away from Colombia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Exactly, the love-hate feeling goes back throughout their history, and
                    you had to understand its psychological aspects to be able to juggle the two
                    sides, to play up the love side and try to play down the hate side. It was
                    difficult, but somehow we managed. I felt that Jack Vaughn did a superior job in
                    this respect. His successor, Charles Adair, was also a very able ambassador and
                    worked very hard at it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he speak Spanish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes. He was a Latin American hand and spoke Spanish quite well. He did
                    not have the vernacular flair that made Jack Vaughn so popular, but he conducted
                    his office with dignity and was well respected by both the government and the
                    public.</p>
                <p>I had intimate relations with the press, both the anti-American and the
                    pro-American and even those who were available just for what they could get out
                    of it. You know, if you wanted an anti-American column you could pay a guy and
                    he would write you an anti-American column. If you wanted a pro-American column,
                    you could pay someone—maybe even the same man—and get the same results.
                    Columnists for hire, I guess, is what they were. I should make the point here
                    that never in all my career with USIS did I pay a single dime to get a newspaper
                    column inserted. But there were also quite a few whose integrity was not for
                    sale. I knew them all, their lines, who you could trust and who you couldn't, in
                    the press as well as in radio and television.</p>
                <p>Apart from my regular information officer activities, I developed a program for
                    myself based on my NASA experience. Interest in the U.S. lunar exploration
                    program was high at the time so I acquired a set of NASA slides and developed a
                    slide lecture at the binational center, the Instituto Panameno-Norteamericano,
                    and at various schools to help promote what we were then emphasizing in our
                    information output, the U.S. in space.</p>
                <p>I felt that we did a commendable job for American interests in Panama; but the
                    problem of the Panama Canal was bigger than any of us, and there were strong
                    differences of opinion among the American officials working in the Embassy and
                    in the Canal Zone about the proper role for the United States with respect to
                    the canal. Eventually they were resolved by the treaty negotiated by the Carter
                    administration. I recall a discussion at my home one night with an official from
                    the Panama Canal information office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An American?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes. An American and a Panamanian journalist whom I respected. We were
                    discussing the pros and cons of the American presence in the canal and how they
                    might be resolved. In part, I was playing the devil's advocate with respect to
                    the American role; and some of the ideas I expressed appeared later in the
                    Carter-Torrijos treaty. The Panama Canal information officer took strong offense
                    and wrote a bitter denunciation accusing me of being anti-American and working
                    against the United States interests from within the staff of USIS. He submitted
                    it to the DCM, very tough guy, and the DCM called me to his office and asked me
                    to defend my outspoken attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the ambassador's attitude at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It wasn't the ambassador. It was the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know, but what was the ambassador's attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: He was in the difficult position of trying to keep a straddle of two
                    shaky platforms, the American and the Panamanian. I don't think the matter ever
                    reached the ambassador. The DCM said “Harry, maybe you ought to be a little more
                    discreet when you talk in front of these guys.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were his personal beliefs? Did he feel we ought to
                        keep the canal or was he sympathetic with our attempt gradually to turn it
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I think he tended to be sympathetic with our efforts to turn it over.
                    That was Rufus Smith who later became ambassador to Canada, a very able
                    political officer. I think he sympathized with me and what I was trying to do.
                    It had been a conversation in my own home among supposed friends, where for the
                    sake of conversation you might take one side and then the other at times. The
                    DCM asked me to give him a written reply for the record. I did and never heard
                    anything more about it, though my relations with my PanCanal “friends” became
                    somewhat strained. That episode was one of my more uncomfortable moments in
                    Panama, but it didn't stop me from expressing myself. We spent three years in
                    Panama, many trips up and down the peninsula, many trips to villages, village
                    fairs, out into the boon-docks, into the banana plantations, to country fairs,
                    and entertaining press and television people, all the stuff USIS does.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>KENDALL: Carl Davis at first. Later we worked together in Santiago, Chile. Then
                    Hoyt Ware. Hoyt was an old AP man. You knew him. Our tour of duty was up in
                    1967. He went there in March of '64 and left in the spring of '67 with an
                    assignment to Santiago in the same position</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Jim Echols was there when I arrived. After about a year Carl Davis
                    succeeded him. Do you remember Jim Echols?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I never knew him. Was Halsema there anything that you
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Jim Halsema had been there earlier, and I knew Jim from service in
                    Washington rather than in Santiago. Jim Echols had come out of the English
                    teaching program and he never felt quite at home with the political problems
                    which confronted us in Santiago, a highly politicized society. He had a tough
                    ambassador, Ralph Dungan, a Kennedy appointee. He left a couple of months after
                    I arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who was the ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Ralph Dungan was succeeded by Ed Korry who had been ambassador in
                    Ethiopia. He had been a correspondent for Look magazine when Kennedy appointed
                    him to the post in Addis Ababa. Nixon appointed him to Santiago. He always liked
                    to remind people that he was both a Kennedy and Nixon appointee. He was an
                    excellent writer and his despatches were considered favorite reading in the
                    State Department. I'm afraid his promising ambassadorial career ended in the
                    bitterness engendered by prolonged Congressional investigations into U.S.
                    involvement in the whole Allende affair.</p>
                <p>My wife and I and our three daughters went to Santiago in July of '67, after home
                    leave and transfer from Panama. Because Santiago is south of the equator it was
                    in the middle of the school year and our children had difficult problems
                    adjusting. I hope in some of your interviews you talk about the problems of
                    families.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's perfectly all right. You don't want just a
                        cut and dried discussion of programming, you want something that gives
                        flavor to the whole experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>KENDALL: In Chile we encountered a school problem similar to the one we had had
                    in Panama where I had gone in the middle of the spring session. In retrospect I
                    could have done that better. I should have left my family in Washington, D.C.
                    and then brought them down to Panama after I had gotten established. But my
                    family didn't want daddy to go off and leave them. They wanted to go with daddy.
                    So we pulled them out of school in mid spring and moved down to Panama City. The
                    same thing happened to us again when we moved down to Santiago, Chile, except
                    that we left Panama during the summer vacation and they entered the Chilean
                    school system in the middle of the school term, Chile being south of the
                    equator. The children suffered in terms of their schooling and of adapting
                    themselves. It's very hard on kids to move around that way. I think many Foreign
                    Service families don't really understand how difficult it is on the children.
                    They adapt because kids do, but they suffer.</p>

                    Landing</p>
                <p>In any case we went down to Santiago in July. I was chief information officer
                    with three IO's working under me, one exclusively on the AID program, one on the
                    press, and a third on radio, TV and motion pictures. I also served as deputy PAO
                    and in the PAO's absence, as acting PAO. I have many memories from Santiago, but
                    I suppose that most interesting and lasting one was my brief experience as a
                    television celebrity in the guise of a space man.</p>
                <p>There was a NASA tracking station in Santiago operated jointly by the Chileans
                    and Americans. The director was a genial, bilingual NASA scientist named Chester
                    Shaddeau and known to all as Chet. At this time the Apollo flights were under
                    way, and one of the TV stations was carrying satellite broadcasts, but they were
                    all in English and the station didn't have anyone with sufficient knowledge of
                    space exploration to tell the audience what was going on. So they asked Chet and
                    me to help them out of explaining in Spanish what the moon landing program was
                    all about. We put on what we jocularly called the Chet and Harry show, a
                    take-off on Huntley and Brinkley.</p>
                <p>I remember spending not just hours, but days in front of the TV cameras on
                    Channel 13, the Catholic University station, explaining with models what was
                    happening with the rocket, with the Apollo capsule, what the astronauts were
                    doing at any given time, and answering phoned in questions from the
                    audience.</p>

                <p>KENDALL: They were live programs.</p>

                        last?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Sometimes as long as three or four hours straight, particularly during
                    the Apollo 11 moon landing. This was live television being broadcast in English
                    from the moon. The Chilean audience doesn't understand very much English so we
                    were asked to do a certain amount of voicing over, a certain amount of
                    interpreting. We did that, and during the lulls between action—there were many
                    lulls between action—there would be these phoned in questions. So I became a
                    household figure to be trailed down the street by children seeking
                    autographs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Boy it was an ego trip. I would meet people at receptions and they would
                    say, “Oh, I know you. I had you in my living room. You've been in my house.” I
                    don't think I would really want to live that way for very long, but it was fun
                    for awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a heady experience for awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It was a very heady experience. On the basis of that experience, Bob
                    Amerson, who was then area director for Latin America, asked me if I would
                    escort the Apollo 11 moon rock exhibit on a tour of the Latin American Area. As
                    you will recall, the Agency wanted to take full advantage of the favorable
                    publicity generated by the Apollo 11 lunar landing, so working with NASA they
                    put together an exhibit on the American lunar landing program. The centerpiece
                    was a moon rock about the size of a walnut brought back by Apollo 11 mounted in
                    a rotating jeweler's display case inside a large plastic globe. A spotlight on
                    the rock and a continuous play tape recording explaining its origin that lent a
                    bit of drama to the exhibit. A copy of this exhibit went to each of the major
                    geographical areas. Since the rocks were considered a priceless artifacts the
                    Agency assigned USIS officers to accompany them to the various posts for
                    display. I was a natural for the Latin American tour, and for six months I
                    lugged that big exhibit and that tiny little moon rock all around Latin America.
                    I went to 19 countries, setting it up and taking it down at each stop, sometimes
                    several times in countries like Mexico and Brazil. I watched hundreds of
                    thousands of people pass through the exhibit. I gave press conferences and
                    lectures. I answered questions at the exhibit, and I appeared on innumerable
                    radio and TV programs, answering questions from listeners. It all became very
                    repetitive after a while, but it was an interesting experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>In another aspect of the program, USIA, the Department of State, and NASA
                    provided each of our ambassadors with a tiny speck of moon rock imbedded in
                    Lucite and mounted on a decorative stand for presentation to the chief of state
                    in the name of the people of the United States. I am not sure what they did in
                    other areas, but in Latin America most of our ambassadors chose to make the
                    presentation in connection with the visit of my exhibit. And I was asked to go
                    along and give a little spiel about the lunar exploration program. I have
                    photographs of myself with the presidents of a number of countries, including
                    Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Chile, Ecuador, and even with Stroessner in
                    Paraguay. It was an interesting experience, but after six months of that I was
                    really beat.</p>

                        the United States at the time you were in Chile? Of course we haven't gotten

                        didn't do, but actually did do in intervening in the elections of Chile. It
                        hadn't all come out. What did you judge the feeling of the Chileans to be
                        with regard to the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Generally favorable but there was an awful lot of very strong communist
                    movement there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know there was and still is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It was a highly politicized society. It was impossible to get into any
                    conversation without it turning toward politics, mostly internal, but the
                    Chileans were always aware of the two competing American and Soviet influences
                    lurking on the sidelines. My contacts were primarily with the media people. They
                    worked very hard and published their newspapers in a situation of almost
                    complete freedom of the press. There was a communist newspaper, El Siglo, and
                    there were communist radio programs. I encountered the communist editors and
                    journalists on frequent social occasions, and my name occasionally appeared in
                    their columns identified as the “well known yankee imperialist.” I'll never
                    forget—and I've repeated this story many times—a communist editor asking me for
                    an interview. “And how will you use this interview if I give it to you,” I asked
                    him.</p>
                <p>“Oh,” he said, “I'll use it against you, of course.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>He was quite frank and open about it. If you didn't answer their questions they
                    would still make up something and publish it anyway.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I answered some very brief questions from him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I presume you had to take this up with the ambassador
                        before you did the interview, or did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: As I recall with Carl Davis, the PAO, took it up with him and he said,
                    “Yes, but keep it brief.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think you got much of our point of view across in

                <p>KENDALL: Yes, to a certain extent, but I also found that our colleagues from the
                    other agency were also very active, and I often wondered where some of this
                    stuff was coming from, but it had its mark. The Chileans also had their
                    journalists for sale.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know, that happened in every country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It was difficult trying to conduct an out-front type of operation in a
                    situation where you think you're getting something across, and you keep seeing
                    commentaries appear in the press with outward appearances of being locally
                    originated but you know is now written by local journalists. You could be fairly
                    certain where the anti-American, pro-communist materials were coming from but
                    would just have to guess who was placing the other kinds of material.</p>

                    Kendall Felt USIS Was Successful Only To Limited Degree Because Of Powerful
                    Communist Influence</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Yes, we managed to get our point of view across in the non-communist press, but
                    it was hard work. However, I must say that at least during the third year of my
                    Chilean assignment I spent far more time out of the country working on area wide
                    programs than I did on the Chilean program. The press work was left pretty much
                    up to Bob Cohoes who was my deputy. He was politically savvy and handled it very
                    well. Last time I saw him he was in Mexico City as head of the regional
                    publications center there, a very able man. So I would give Bob a lion's share
                    of the credit for our work with the Chilean press. Ed Elly worked on the AID
                    programs and deserves most of the credit for what we were able to achieve in
                    that area. Bob Meyers handled radio, TV and motion pictures in a creative and
                    imaginative fashion and had our programs on virtually every important radio and
                    TV station in the country. I take a small amount of credit for his achievements
                    because he had trained under me as a JOT in Panama, but most of it was due to
                    his own native intelligence. After Chile he attended a special State Department
                    course in economics and went on to serve as the press spokesman for the U.S.
                    delegation to the GATT conference in Geneva, among other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think, within reason, we were effective in
                        Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Within reason, but we certainly didn't succeed in countering the heavy
                    communist influence. As I said before, the country was so highly politicized it
                    was difficult to make any real mark. You couldn't open a conversation, any kind
                    of conversation, whether it be about art and literature, or culture and travel
                    abroad, anything, without local politics raising its ugly head. It sort of
                    permeated everything, everything you did. Yet I was able to talk to many of the
                    editors and news media people. We entertained a lot in our home. We had a large
                    residence and plenty of space. Margaret did an awful lot of entertaining in
                    those days. Fortunately the rate of exchange made it possible and we had a good
                    staff of domestic help. But I never really felt that we achieved as much as we
                    should have or could have in a less politicized situation.</p>
                <p>After I returned from my six months' trip with the moon rock, I was acting PAO
                    while Carl Davis went on home leave. I had been back at post for less than a
                    month when I got a telegram from Washington telling me that my next assignment
                    was Saigon—without family. I wasn't very happy about that. I sat down to think
                    it over for a while. This was in 1970 at the height of the Vietnam war.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: In July of '70.</p>

                        where I had been for three years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: So I sat down and thought about it. I asked myself, do you want this or
                    not. I had two choices, accept or resign. Finally, I said to myself, “Harry,
                    that's where the action is. Why don't you try it.”</p>
                <p>So I did. I accepted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they only requiring you to stay for a year or a year

                <p>KENDALL: So I went back to Washington, settled my family in our house in the Wood
                    Acres section of Bethesda, and took off for Saigon. I got there in October of
                    1970.</p>

                    Defeated USIS Efforts To Defend American Position There</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go to your assignment in Vietnam, I think you
                        had been speaking about another experience you had in Santiago. So why don't
                        you cover that now before we go on to the Vietnamese assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: This concerned the Vietnam War. We talked of the anti-American,
                    pro-American attitudes there. Talking about these things one begins to recall
                    other things. Each little incident, each little conversation brings up new
                    recollections. The Vietnam war was in full swing at the time. One of our major
                    problems in the information program and getting across an image of an America
                    knowing what it stands for, what it is doing, and where it is going revolved
                    around the Vietnam war.</p>
                <p>One of the programs we conducted in the effort to convince the Chileans America
                    was on the right track in Vietnam was sending journalists as well as our own
                    officers on visits to Vietnam to see for themselves. We sent our public affairs
                    officers, we sent journalists, the ones who would go. Some of them wouldn't. I
                    recall that Santiago's leading journalist at the time accepted our invitation
                    and was really looking forward to the trip. To give him an advance orientation,
                    I got hold of a prize winning combat film on the Vietnam war produced by a
                    French team. It was really far too effective. He looked at that film and decided
                    he didn't really want to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scared him to death?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Really scared him. I don't think he had any idea about the ferocity of
                    the combat before seeing that film. But there were other aspects. One of the
                    hotbeds of communism was in the University of Chile's Institute of International
                    Studies. We had good contacts there and worked with their people. But they were
                    one of the most articulate anti-U.S., particularly anti-U.S. action in Vietnam,
                    groups in the whole country. They were very articulate and very effective. They
                    wrote prolifically, denouncing U.S. Vietnam policy as American imperialism on
                    press, radio, and television, repeating the same theme over and over again, so
                    that it would have been difficult for any ordinary listener not to question
                    American motives for being in Vietnam. Of course, many of them were communists
                    and were supporting the official communist line. How many of them were speaking
                    out of their own convictions or simply parroting the communist line it's
                    difficult to say.</p>
                <p>As I said, we worked with the University of Chile and brought a number of
                    visiting American professors there to lecture and to interact with the faculty
                    at the Institute of International Studies. Jim Echols, our PAO before Carl
                    Davis, went to Vietnam on the Agency's program designed to help our field
                    officers to tell the Vietnam story and appeared before this group when he
                    returned. I regret to say they tore him to bits. He had learned much but not
                    nearly enough. Another much more effective presenter was Douglas Pike, whom you
                    must certainly know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's living right around here now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Doug is now my colleague at U.C. Berkeley. In fact, he works with me in
                    the Institute of East Asian Studies and heads up our program of Indochina
                    Studies. He had been a USIS officer in Vietnam since 1964 and had published a
                    definitive book on the Viet Cong, so USIS sent him on a world lecture tour
                    meeting with groups like we had at the University of Chile. He had all the
                    information at the tip of his tongue and could mobilize his facts and
                    information into convincing arguments. So when he came to Santiago we took him
                    to the Institute of International Studies. He answered all of their very
                    emotional, heated questions in a factual, non-emotional manner. But even Doug
                    Pike with his great ability didn't win anybody over. He gave them satisfaction
                    because he answered their question, but he agreed later that he hadn't won any
                    converts.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>This was an example of the type of work we were trying to do. But we simply could
                    not make any impression. So as a result we just had to withdraw from the arena.
                    The essence of the whole thing is that we finally decided that Vietnam was a
                    losing issue for us. We just had to stop talking about it in our official output
                    because we got nowhere. Every time we said something they used it against us so
                    we finally just responded to questions when asked. It was a definite decision on
                    our part. Ambassador Korry agreed with Carl Davis and me that this was the best
                    way to handle that particular issue. Just don't talk about it unless you
                    absolutely have to. Don't deny it, but certainly don't volunteer to talk abut it
                    with the news media.</p>
                <p>These are some of the factors that conditioned my response to my own assignment
                    to Vietnam. I am ready to move over to that arena if you wish to do so.</p>
                <p>

                <p>October 1970: Arrived In Saigon - JUSPAO Economic Policy Officer</p>
                <p>KENDALL: October of 1970. My assignment was to JUSPAO, the Joint U.S. Public
                    Affairs Office. There was already a very large contingent of USIA officers
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the time that Bob Lincoln was JUSPAO? Barry
                        Zorthian, I think, had left just shortly before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Barry had left and Ed Nickel was there. Maury Lee was his deputy.
                    Lincoln succeeded Nickel.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Washington, I asked the personnel officer, “What is my assignment?
                    What am I going to do?” “Oh,” he said, “you're going to be an economic policy
                    officer.”</p>
                <p>“What do you mean, economic policy officer, I don't know anything about
                    economics.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, you'll learn, you'll learn.”</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I suppose that being a Foreign Service Officer means you're supposed to be
                    capable of doing anything. I went there as an economic policy officer and stayed
                    two years. My family, of course, was back in Washington on separate maintenance
                    allowance (SMA) as it was called, and the girls were in school. You were allowed
                    three weeks leave for family visitation every six months. So during the two
                    years I was there I was able to come home about three times to visit my family
                    for three weeks. It was a long hard trip but certainly worth it to see your
                    family. My kids got along surprisingly well. When I came back my daughter Nancy
                    said, “Mommy, we'll have to change our whole pattern now. When Daddy was away we
                    were doing fine. Now we've got to adjust to him again.” She was a teenager just
                    beginning senior high school.</p>
                <p>Kendall's Opinion On Vietnam: JUSPAO Greatly Overstaffed; Total U.S. Government
                    Made Serious Errors In Foreign And Military Policy As Well As In Specific
                    Judgments</p>
                <p>The Saigon job was interesting, but I felt we were grossly overstaffed. We often
                    think of an ambassador's problems in getting to know his own staff, but there
                    the Public Affairs Officer, the head of JUSPAO, had a staff larger than most
                    embassies. I didn't really feel that during the time I was there that I got to
                    know Ed Nickel very well although we had good relations. I knew Maury much
                    better because I had worked with him in Japan. He was a branch PAO in Yokohama
                    when I was in Takamatsu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was John Clyne there at that time or had he gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I think John was there for part of my tour, but most of the time I was
                    there, he was not. I knew John quite well in Washington. I'd be hard pressed to
                    name all of the people who were there with me. There were many. John Hogan was
                    in Danang; Forrest Fischer was in Hue; Jerry Novick was up in Nha Trang. Brian
                    Battey was in Saigon as were many other USIS officers. Many of my co-workers
                    were military officers with whom I had no previous or subsequent contact. They
                    were intermingled with USIS officers in Saigon and in the countryside in the
                    four corps areas, First, Second, Third and Fourth. Our ambassador was Ellsworth
                    Bunker, one of the grand old men of the Foreign Service. God rest his soul.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, Douglas Pike is currently editing Ambassador Bunker's private
                    telegrams to President Johnson for publication by the University of California
                    Press. We obtained them from the State Department under the provisions of the
                    Freedom of Information Act. They are a very illuminating set of papers.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>My job was to maintain contact with the AID and to prepare policy guidances for
                    information output on its various programs, particularly land reform and
                    economic development. Imagine writing guidances for a USIS staff. You ought to
                    be able to just tell them what the policy is and they can follow it, but we had
                    so many people spread around the countryside that it was necessary to
                    communicate to them in writing. I prepared these. They would go out over the
                    PAO's signature, of course.</p>
                <p>One Kendall Project - Survey Of Vietnamese Labor Leaders' Opinions On Problems
                    And Possible Solutions — Felt To Be Good And Useful</p>
                <p>I remember one project of which I was quite proud. It was a survey of Vietnamese
                    labor leaders to determine what their main concerns were and what approaches
                    they wanted the Vietnamese government to take towards resolving them. I did it
                    over a period of several weeks, travelling up and down the country with my
                    Vietnamese assistant, a man named Ha Quoc Buu, who is today working with Douglas
                    Pike in our Indochina archive. Buu and I traveled to most of the provincial
                    capitals around South Vietnam interviewing local labor leaders in depth. Then,
                    on the basis of these interviews, I prepared a report which Ambassador Bunker
                    commended for use by his staff.</p>
                <p>One of the things that astounded me when I first arrived in Saigon was that we
                    were not conducting a standard USIS type program. We were, in fact, running a
                    ministry of information for the Vietnamese government. We were publishing their
                    newspapers and magazines for them and operating their radio and TV stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the magazines and newspapers published in Vietnamese
                        or in French or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Publish in Vietnamese and English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, in Vietnamese and English, mostly Vietnamese. Most of it was
                    written in English and then translated into Vietnamese. Because of this I
                    suppose I was very skeptical about the whole approach.</p>
                <p>I went to Saigon thoroughly convinced that the United States was doing a
                    marvelous job and this was exactly what we should be doing. I came away feeling
                    that we had missed the boat.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I felt we really had made some horrible errors in our foreign and military
                    policy, and that many of our top leaders in Washington and Vietnam had made some
                    very serious mistakes in judgment. We were trying to run a government of a
                    country where we not only didn't understand the language, we didn't understand
                    the culture, we didn't understand the people, we didn't understand the history.
                    We knew very little about them yet we were trying to run the country for them.
                    We were fighting their war for them. We were conducting a horribly expensive
                    program in terms of money and lives and effort based at times on what I would
                    call sheer ignorance, though undoubtedly out of conviction that we were doing
                    exactly what was needed to be done.</p>
                <p>On a more personal basis, I got to know the Vietnamese people quite well. I
                    developed quite a few friends among them. I got to know the country and
                    personally derived a great deal of benefit from my experience there. In terms of
                    my contribution to the total effort, perhaps I added a grain of sand to that
                    huge sandy beach of a sterile U.S. policy. I don't know. I didn't really feel
                    good about it.</p>
                <p>I still continue my interests in Vietnam and Indochina after these many years. I
                    conducted a small research project on Vietnamese attitudes toward the Soviet
                    presence and published an article about it in our institute's journal, Asian
                    Survey. I helped a Vietnamese professor write a book which we called After
                    Saigon Fell: Daily Life Under The Vietnamese Communists. It was published by our
                    Institute of East Asian Studies and sold out two printings. It was also
                    translated and published in the Korean language. I work with Douglas Pike in his
                    Indochina Studies Program. I feel good about my own personal experience. I feel
                    very sad about the American experience in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Specific Delineation Of U.S. Errors As Seen By Kendall</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you care to be a little more specific about three or
                        four of the serious errors that we made without going into too much detail?
                        Would you indicate where the areas of our greatest mistakes were, what they
                        were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Are you talking about nationally or are you talking about USIS?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I suppose both since the two are pretty well
                        inextricably interwoven. But you said that you came to feel that we had made
                        very serious mistakes in several fields, and I didn't know whether you were
                        talking specifically about the U.S. information program or whether you were
                        talking about our policy generally or a combination of both.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>KENDALL: I was referring to our policy generally. We plunged that country into
                    deep war. I'm reminded of a comment by Professor Robert Scalapino who is
                    director of our Institute of East Asian Studies. He was lecturing in Vietnam in
                    1974 or early 1975. He said a very thoughtful Vietnamese officer stood up and
                    said, “Now, professor, when the United States forces came into Vietnam in
                    1964-65, you came without our knowing you were coming and it took us a long time
                    to adjust to it. Now, you are leaving us and you're doing it without our knowing
                    it and we don't know why. We have difficulty understanding what United States
                    policy is all about.”</p>
                <p>Professor Scalapino said, “I couldn't respond to that comment.”</p>
                <p>A. U.S. Raison d'Etre For Entering Vietnam Conflict Based On Ignorance Of
                    Vietnamese History And Misjudgment Re A Moscow-Beijing Axis</p>
                <p>We sent our people to run their government who didn't know the language or the
                    history of the country. I think the grossest error was the whole raison d'etre
                    for intervening in that war. We were intervening to keep the Sino-Soviet
                    alliance from taking over Southeast Asia. We were trying to protect the
                    Vietnamese from China. The Vietnamese have been fighting the Chinese throughout
                    history and have thrown them out on various occasions. Our leaders didn't seem
                    to know this. We were afraid of the Moscow-Beijing Axis and they can't get
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had already shattered that Axis ten years
                        before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>B. Trying To Tell Vietnamese How To Run Their Own Government</p>
                <p>KENDALL: The decision to go into Vietnam was to prevent monolithic communism from
                    moving down into Southeast Asia, the domino theory. As history has since taught
                    us, communism is no more monolithic than capitalism. That was one basic error.
                    Another was trying to tell the Vietnamese how to run their own government. We
                    manipulated Ngo Dinh Diem and all of his successors. We have enough difficulty
                    running our own government let alone trying to run somebody else's for them. We
                    imposed decisions upon them which they couldn't carry out, didn't have either
                    the will, the means or the ability to carry out.</p>
                <p>The murder of Ngo Dinh Diem was in part our own fault even though our people
                    didn't pull the trigger. We didn't tell them to do it but we didn't tell them
                    not to either.</p>
                <p>There is an interesting episode from the 1954 Geneva conference which divided
                    Vietnam in half. After the conference Zhou En-lai extended his hand to John
                    Foster Dulles in a gesture of friendship. Dulles walked on past and left Zhou
                    standing there. Here was an opportunity for our leaders to talk to each other to
                    try to achieve some understanding, but Dulles refused on the basis, I suppose,
                    that he considered Zhou En-lai to be evil. It's the same inflexible ideological
                    outlook that inspired Reagan's remarks on the evil empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>In Vietnam we based our policies on the sense of morality that not only condemns
                    communism as evil, but even the people who live under communism as evil. As we
                    see now, they are desperately trying to get out from under communism.</p>
                <p>C. U. S. Made Decisions Re Vietnam Based On American Attitudes Without Seeking Or
                    Listening To Counsel Of Relative Few Who Knew Something About Vietnam</p>
                <p>These are just some of the thoughts that come to mind. I would say mainly that
                    the United States had some, very few, experts on Vietnam, but their counsel and
                    advice was not sought and if given, was not listened to. The decisions made by
                    people ranging from President Johnson on down were made on the basis of American
                    attitudes, American reactions to given situations which did not or could not
                    apply to people of the Vietnamese culture. I just think that our country has not
                    really organized its top level decision-making to be able to take advantage of
                    the knowledge and information that is available to us.</p>
                <p>U.S. Informational Efforts Did Have Significant Impact On Educated/Literate
                    Vietnamese Concerning Need To Modernize Their Economic And Social Systems</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that our information program in Vietnam had
                        any effect at all, or a very minimal effect, or that it was pretty much
                        useless?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It had a great deal of effect on persuading the Vietnamese people that
                    they really wanted to live like Americans. It had its greatest impact on the
                    literate Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the literacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: On the literate Vietnamese. I think the ordinary Vietnamese, the ones
                    who had no access to the informational media, were not affected by it except
                    secondarily through their leaders. But yes, we had significant effect on
                    persuading the South Vietnamese that they should modernize their economic and
                    social system. You must remember there was a great deal of travel back and
                    forth, not just Americans to Vietnam but literate and well educated Vietnamese
                    to the United States for training purposes under programs operated by JUSPAO,
                    AID and especially the U.S. military. The Vietnamese are a very intelligent
                    people and they quickly learned to appreciate the benefits of a modern
                    technological society.</p>
                <p>U.S. Military Taught Vietnamese Military Art Of Fighting With Heavy Firepower,
                    Which Was Relatively Ineffective For Vietnam War, And To Depend On U.S. Supply
                    Source. When U.S. Terminated Supply Line, Vietnamese Were Confused,
                    Discouraged—Lost Will To Fight</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>The primary influences brought to bear were the military. But when the crunch
                    came, we just simply withdrew and left them high and dry. We trained them in the
                    use of our technology and our military equipment and taught them to depend on
                    the United States as a source of supply, I think improperly so because they were
                    fighting a war in which the heavy firepower we brought to bear was relatively
                    ineffective. But when we withdrew they didn't know where to turn. We had built
                    up a series of leaders who were entirely dependent on American support, and when
                    they didn't get that support in the final hour they became completely
                    disheartened.</p>
                <p>They didn't lose to the communists because they didn't have the equipment, they
                    lost because they had lost the will to fight when their source of primary
                    support withdrew. Maybe we lost the war for them. Maybe they lost it for
                    themselves. I don't know.</p>
                <p>Disillusionment With Communism After North Vietnamese Takeover In 1975 Probably
                    Due Mostly To Insensitive Rigidity Of Northerners In Governing</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably a combination of both. It would be interesting to
                        know and I suppose there is no way of determining now, whether or not there
                        is any residue of feeling about governmental policies about way of life or
                        anything else left in the country as a result of the American presence there
                        for so many years. Most of them seem to have become disillusioned with the
                        communist takeover and the communist government, even those probably who
                        felt sympathetic toward it before it took over South Vietnam. Do you think
                        probably more of that is due to the insensitivity and stupidity of the
                        communists themselves, the government that took over, then it is to anything
                        that the Americans did while they were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: You have to give much credit to the arrogance and stupidity of the
                    communists and their self imposed policies since the end of the Vietnam War.
                    They had developed their whole system on the basis of military action with
                    everything done for a single cause, which was to gain independence and unity of
                    Vietnam. Once they achieved this purpose they were insufficiently flexible to be
                    able to change over to a peacetime mode of life. The people in power were the
                    same people who had conducted their 30-year struggle for independence. Having
                    attained their initial purpose they did not perceive the necessity for change to
                    conduct a peacetime economy. They overlooked the Chinese saying that “You can
                    conquer an enemy from horseback but you can't rule the people that way.” It will
                    probably take a new generation before they will be able to change around
                    completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But do you think it's primarily the communists that did
                        themselves in with their own people rather than any residual effect that the
                        American presence may have had?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, there is no question about that. I think for the benefit of your
                    series, it might be well for you to talk to Doug Pike.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will talk to Doug Pike. I don't know whether I'll get
                        to interview him or whether Earl Wilson will try to do that when he comes
                        back through here in February. But one or the other of us will do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: He is by far the most eloquent, most knowledgeable about our whole
                    experience in Vietnam. He went there in 1964 as a films officer with the idea of
                    studying the Vietnamese method of field communications and developed that into
                    his classic study of the Viet Cong. He has been working on Vietnam ever since
                    and certainly the most knowledgeable in that field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we have probably milked your experience in Vietnam
                        to the extent that is worthwhile on this tape. You went from Vietnam then
                        back to Washington for a time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1973: Policy Officer For East Asia And Pacific Area</p>
                <p>KENDALL: Right. I went there as area policy officer for East Asia and the
                    Pacific. It was a Washington desk job of developing articulating area policy for
                    the media and the field. I left Vietnam in November of '72 and went into the
                    area policy job in January of '73. From the time I arrived until I left in July
                    1975 the major part of our effort was on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>The focus of our effort was on Vietnam. We had several officers on the area staff
                    who had served there. Maury Lee was deputy area director. Frank Scotton was our
                    China officer. Ed Baumgartner was our Vietnam specialist. Several others on the
                    staff, such as myself, had also had experience in Vietnam. The information flow
                    from Saigon and Bangkok was programmed into the general output, and we tried to
                    combine that with policy directives from the White House and the State
                    Department into meaningful guidance for the Agency media and the field. I'm not
                    sure how successful we were.</p>
                <p>My job was coordinating with the Agency media and other area offices. I do not
                    feel that this was a very significant part of my career. I always felt much
                    better when I was out in the field. My area director for the first year was a
                    man named Kent Crane, whom you must have known.</p>
                <p>Observations On Kent Crane, Assistant Director For East Asia And Pacific</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I never knew him personally. I just knew a great deal
                        about him because most of the time he was there I was in Bangkok.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>KENDALL: Kent Crane was a Republican political appointee and a hard liner. He had
                    served with the CIA in Indonesia and had worked on Spiro Agnew's team during the
                    1968 presidential campaign. While Spiro Agnew was in the Vice Presidency, Kent
                    Crane was in USIA. When Agnew resigned, it wasn't long before Kent Crane left. I
                    would not want to go into too many personal comments on this tape, but Kent
                    Crane was a man who had great ambitions for himself.</p>
                <p>He was not a man with a great deal of experience in USIA and I don't think he
                    really understood USIA's operational philosophy. I would say that he was not a
                    terribly effective area director and tended to create more enemies for himself
                    than he did friends among the Agency bureaucracy. He traveled a lot, did get out
                    and talk to people, but he was never in agreement with USIA's basic approaches.
                    He had serious difficulties with the Agency director, Jim Keogh. I'm afraid he
                    didn't enjoy Keogh's respect. We worked with him because as bureaucrats you work
                    with your boss. Yet, on a personal basis we got along very well. However, I
                    would rather not go into any further discussions of him.</p>
                <p>My role as area policy officer also involved liaison with the various country
                    desk officers in the State Department and participation in their weekly
                    meetings. In this role I encountered a number of Foreign Service Officers whom I
                    greatly admired. Perhaps the most notable was Art Hummel who was our colleague
                    in Tokyo when you and I were in Japan in '55, '56, '57. He was then deputy
                    assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, working under
                    Ambassador Phil Habib. Phil is also a man for whom we all have great love and
                    respect. Habib is retired and lives in this area now, down in Belmont on the
                    peninsula south of San Francisco. We see him from time to time. He is on the
                    board of directors of The Asia Foundation and participates in the World Affairs
                    Council in the San Francisco area, when he is not away on some special project
                    for the White House as he was so much during the Reagan administration.</p>
                <p>I liked my colleagues within the agency and worked with them quite well. But as I
                    said before, I do not consider that tour of duty to be one of the more
                    outstanding aspects of my career with USIA. But if you have any questions about
                    it I'll be happy to answer them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess since my experience with the Vietnamese situation
                        was largely from afar, partly from the viewpoint of Thailand, I really am
                        not in a position to ask as many intelligent questions as I might. So
                        perhaps we'd better leave that aspect of your program and move onto your
                        next assignment then.</hi>

                    Assigned To Position, Designated Regional Programs Officer: 1975</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KENDALL: After Kent Crane and Maury Lee left, Bill Payeff and Clifton Forster
                    came in as area director and deputy director, respectively. I was with them for
                    the better part of a year and enjoyed working with them. I had worked with Clif
                    in Japan in the '50s and we were very good friends, still are. During that time
                    we were struggling with the problem of how to bring more U.S. expertise to bear
                    in our overseas programs, particularly in terms of AMPARTS, the American
                    Participant or speaker programs. The Agency's budget for funding AMPARTS was
                    insufficient to get more than a small percentage of the people we needed out to
                    the field. We knew there was a great deal of American talent traveling back and
                    forth to Asia, but all too often the Agency or the posts learned about them too
                    late to take advantage of their presence. After some discussion we began to see
                    a solution in the establishment of a regional programs office in Asia to keep
                    tabs on travel by potential participants and somehow arrange for them to take
                    part in our USIS programs. Tokyo was the logical place for it because it was
                    centrally located and had the greatest amount of traffic. Clif and Bill asked me
                    to draw up a project paper for the establishment of an office there, and perhaps
                    on the basis of my having drawn up the job description for it, I got the
                    job.</p>
                <p>I must say I was not too happy about it at first because my old friend Leon Picon
                    came back from Tokyo with horror stories about life in that smog ridden
                    metropolis at the time. His stories made Tokyo sound like what Mexico City is
                    today. Of course, the Japanese shortly began cleaning it up, and when I got
                    there in July 1975 things had changed quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember now, with respect to that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes. That was a very interesting assignment. In preparation for it I
                    visited universities around the country to see what kind of resources I could
                    draw on in terms of professorial talent, who knew Asia, and traveled there with
                    frequency. I went to Columbia, Harvard, the University of Michigan, Chicago, and
                    U.C. Berkeley. One of the people I met on this swing around the country was
                    Robert A. Scalapino, here at Berkeley. He was dean of the Department of
                    Political Science at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he still there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I work for Bob Scalapino now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know, but he left the political science department
                        to take over East Asian Studies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: That's right. Then years ago, in October 1978, he established the
                    Institute of East Asian Studies which has since become one of the most respected
                    institutions of its kind in the United States and abroad.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Through that swing around the country I got to know quite a few professional
                    people who travel in East Asia. Basically the role was to locate speaker talent
                    and channel it to our field posts. So when I got to Tokyo I enlisted the
                    assistance of our other Asian posts and began making an inventory of
                    programmable people such as Fulbright professors already in the area who might
                    be made available to one or more posts. I asked them to alert me whenever they
                    learned of potential talent who might be coming to the area. I found ready
                    cooperation from the various area posts and from the speakers bureau in USIA
                    Washington. The area gave me a budget for travel so that I could send people
                    down to Hong Kong or even to Australia. The posts met the speakers' in country
                    travel and per diem costs and paid them a small honorarium. It was a valuable
                    experience for cooperating academics because it provided them with ready made
                    audiences and contacts with many of their fellow professionals they could not
                    possibly have met otherwise. Whenever I got the name of a candidate I would
                    circularize our posts and they would come back with a “yes” or “no” or with
                    alternate suggestions or request.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this for the whole area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: For the whole area. From Korea down to New Zealand. I also worked out
                    cooperative arrangements for South Asia and at times even got cooperation from
                    posts in Europe. After the establishment of the Regional Programs Office in
                    Tokyo other areas picked up on the idea. One was set up in London and eventually
                    one in New Delhi, and we worked out cooperative arrangements. As part of the
                    program I also traveled to the area posts to explain the services available and
                    get a better understanding of their country program requirements. During the two
                    years I was on the job I think I made three swings around the area plus a number
                    of short trips for special purposes. I also helped schedule people for Japan.
                    Tokyo had its own program office, of course, so I worked closely with them. I
                    had one Japanese assistant, a charming and able woman named Misa Otake who had
                    served many years with USIS Tokyo before I appeared on the scene. She handled
                    travel schedules for me. During my second year business got so brisk we had to
                    add a secretary.</p>
                <p>It was a highly operative program and as a result of my work the Agency gave me a
                    meritorious service award. I had been promised one for my Latin American
                    activities with the moon rock, but it never materialized. I felt amply rewarded
                    when the award also brought me a promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not really yourself involved in the actual
                        running of a program within Japan or any other country. You were providing
                        them with what they needed to get across their points in the countries where
                        they were operating.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>KENDALL: That is correct. I was really a program coordinator, seeking out talent
                    and getting it to them. In 1977 Eugene Schaeffer took over the RPO job. However,
                    I stayed on in Tokyo for another year as field supervisor and country program
                    officer when I began doing the actual programming. But the regional programs
                    office job was basically recruiting. We called it headhunting, you know. In that
                    position I also worked with Kurt Wenzel in the regional audiovisual office
                    developing videotapes for the field posts, based primarily on interviews with
                    visiting personalities we could not schedule for additional travel. Do you
                    remember Kurt Wenzel's videotape programs?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, you see I left in 1972. I've been gone from the agency
                        ever since.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: I see. We had a regional films and TV center in Tokyo where we produced
                    audio visual materials for the East Asian posts. Kurt Wenzel was a picturesque
                    individual, a German POW who had been captured by the U.S. forces in the North
                    African campaign, spent the rest of World War II in a Texas internment camp, and
                    stayed on in the U.S. after the war to become an American citizen. He was a
                    wizard with films and turned his talents to video as that medium grew. When I
                    arrived in Tokyo he was producing videotapes in rented Japanese TV studios, but
                    because of their high costs he persuaded the Agency to fund a fully equipped
                    studio in the Embassy basement. It served the purposes of both the Japan program
                    and the region. It's location in the Embassy proper made it very convenient for
                    us to produce half-hour videotapes. We invited Tokyo based American journalists
                    to serve as interviewers with visiting American government officials or other
                    resource people and provided the tapes to the branch posts in Japan and around
                    the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you voice them over the English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Occasionally, for the Japan program. But we did them mostly in English
                    or, when appropriate, used interpreters. In most of the countries around Asia
                    many of the target audiences, if I may use that term, speak some English. This
                    is particularly true in Southeast Asia, in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and
                    to a lesser extent in Taiwan. Of course, in Australia, New Zealand and the
                    Philippines there was no problem with the language and these videotaped programs
                    were quite useful. Kurt and I worked very closely together on that project.</p>
                <p>Last Year In Japan (1977-8) Field Supervisor And Japan Program Officer</p>
                <p>Then after two years at it I took over as Japan program officer and field
                    supervisor for the six American Centers in Japan and became a “Shinkansen
                    cowboy,” riding the bullet train up and down the Japanese archipelago, looking
                    after the needs of our centers in Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and
                    Fukuoka. It was a rewarding and important job.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Special experiences grew out of my role as regional programs officer and field
                    supervisor for Japan. I met a lot of very interesting people, particularly the
                    scholars visiting Japan. Ezra Vogel of Harvard who was then researching for his
                    book Japan As Number One was one of them. Bob Scalapino came on various
                    occasions as did Larry Krause, one of America's leading economists who is now on
                    the faculty at U.S. San Diego. There were many others.</p>
                <p>One of the more interesting individuals, practically my first recruit, was an
                    expert on waste disposal. Waste disposal is not usually considered a prime
                    concern of USIA, but he was an American expert in a field of increasing concern
                    to many cities in Asia and our posts were hungry for good speakers. I offered
                    him, expecting to get one or two responses, but practically every post asked for
                    him. He did very well, hiking around the garbage dumps of Southeast Asia,
                    telling the local authorities how to better manage their waste disposal
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Another individual, more interesting in terms of our programs, was a specialist
                    in American literature named Charles Anderson, professor emeritus from Johns
                    Hopkins University and a superb lecturer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you schedule them primarily in the universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: The posts did the scheduling, in the universities and in our own
                    cultural centers such as the Tokyo American Center. Anderson came with high
                    recommendations and he seemed to get better with each post report, so everybody
                    wanted him, from Australia to Korea and then on into India and Europe. He was
                    perhaps the single most popular lecturer on the USIS circuit that I've ever
                    known. I feel rather proud for having found him. We are still in contact, he's
                    still writing, lecturing vigorously, even at age 85. Marvelous guy, delightful
                    sense of humor, and a real joy to know.</p>
                <p>Those were some of my activities in Japan. I got out into the hinterland there
                    too, but spent most of my time in the cities where we had our branch posts.</p>
                <p>1978: Assigned To Bangkok As AUA (Binational Center) Director</p>
                <p>In 1978 I was up for transfer. I had been in Tokyo for three years and was
                    looking for a new assignment. Having spent so much time in Asia I thought it was
                    time for me to go to Europe again. You are familiar with the practice of having
                    officers express their preference for ongoing assignment in a first, second,
                    third fashion. When the list of availabilities came up, I think I put down a
                    list of 17 posts where I would be willing to go. Bangkok was not one of them. So
                    I got a phone call in the middle of the night from Mort Smith, then area
                    director in Washington. He said, “Harry, we need you in Bangkok to run the AUA
                    Language Center.”</p>
                <p>“But Mort, I thought I was going to go to Europe again?”</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>“Haven't got anything decent for you in Europe. That's where we need you. Think
                    about it a bit.”</p>
                <p>I thought about it a bit and said, “Okay, I'll go.”</p>
                <p>I had been in Bangkok several times, but I had never been to the language center.
                    I didn't really know what it was about. Milton Leavitt was the man who had been
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the second time by then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Yes, he spent a total of seven years there. He loved it. But he was
                    retiring. So the Agency sent me to Bangkok and I can truly say it was just about
                    the best job I ever had in USIS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a wonderful center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: Wonderful center. And I worked with a grand old man named Phra Bisal
                    Sukhumwit who had established the center back in 1952 under the auspices of
                    American University Alumni Association, a group of returned Thai students from
                    American universities. The fundamental purpose of the AUA was teaching English
                    to Thai students, but we also conducted classes in Thai for Americans and other
                    foreigners. USIS contributed the director, who worked with Phra Bisal, and a
                    director of English language courses—both Foreign Service Officers. The Center
                    was combined with the USIS library which was staffed and maintained by the post
                    but was, is I should say, known as the AUA library. The post also provided for a
                    locally hired cultural director to coordinate Center and USIS cultural programs.
                    Everyone else in the center was employed by the AUA Language Center which
                    operated on tuition income from language classes. I was the manager and
                    administrative director. We had a hundred American teachers, recruited from
                    among the American community, including wives of embassy officials, embassy
                    officials themselves, business people, retired U.S. military personnel, and the
                    like. There were also a number of young American women who had married Thais
                    studying in the United States and come to Bangkok to live. They found a natural
                    outlet for their talents at the center. We trained them all to teach English as
                    a foreign language to our Thai students. This job was handled by Dr. Marvin
                    Brown. Do you remember him?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was not there when I was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>KENDALL: Marvin trained our English teachers, but his specialty was teaching Thai
                    to foreigners, so he also supervised that aspect of our center program. We had a
                    staff of 77 AUA employees, as I recall. It was like a small university. We had
                    something like 7,000 to 8,000 students throughout the whole year. There were
                    some fluctuations, but we taught a lot of English and ran numerous cultural
                    programs. We also operated the best library in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>The Unusual And Wide Ranging Impact Of AUA On Thailand's Literature Population,
                    Both Governmental And Otherwise</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather you felt that and do feel that AUA has made a
                        tremendous impact in Thailand on behalf of friendship with the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: It has indeed. It's difficult to find an educated Thai person who has
                    not had some personal contact with the AUA, everywhere from the King and Queen
                    and the royal prince and princesses of Thailand down to humble students. Even
                    today, ten years after I left there, if I mention to a visiting Thai scholar
                    here at Berkeley that I once served as director of the AUA it immediately
                    establishes a bond between us. There are literally tens of thousands of Thai
                    citizens who have gained a working knowledge of English from the American
                    teachers at the AUA.</p>
                <p>I recall one very amusing incident quite illustrative of the center's influence.
                    My wife and I and a couple of friends were driving along Petchburi road in
                    Bangkok one night looking for a certain movie theater, and somehow I got lost
                    and found myself going the wrong way down a one-way street. A young policeman
                    stopped me and asked for my driver's license. He wasn't impressed by my American
                    Embassy credentials or by the diplomatic plates. Neither was he impressed by my
                    bright red Pacer.</p>
                <p>“Okay,” he said, “there will be a fine on this. Who are you? Where do you
                    work?</p>
                <p>I gave him my name and told him I was the director of the AUA.</p>
                <p>“Oh, the AUA director. I studied English there. That's a fine school. You just
                    turn right around and go this way.”</p>
                <p>To this day the AUA is one of the leading cultural centers in Bangkok. We
                    conducted lectures in Thai about the United States and also about Thailand. As a
                    binational center we felt it necessary to satisfy both audiences. The Thai
                    language classes are very popular among foreigners trying to get established in
                    Bangkok, and regularly enroll foreign embassy personnel and businessmen as well
                    as their families. The other day I had a visitor from Beijing, a Southeast Asia
                    specialist, and learned that he had studied English at the AUA in Bangkok. I was
                    pleased to note that he spoke quite good English.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>All in all it was a very satisfying assignment, and by that time my children had
                    grown up and were going to college. Margaret, my wife, taught English at the AUA
                    all the time we were there. Our youngest daughter, Judy, was at Mills at Oakland
                    and took a semester off to be with us in Bangkok. We put her to teaching English
                    too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bangkok is one of the very few USIS posts around the world
                        that I find is almost better recognized and perhaps better understood than
                        the embassy itself. Whoever is the director of USIS and whoever is the
                        director of the AUA out there has a standing in Bangkok that is really
                        almost greater than the ambassador, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: That is certainly true. I felt it all the time. I was a member of
                    several committees and organizations and was always given a place of honor
                    wherever I went as director of the AUA. The Crown Princess of Thailand and her
                    sister came there on various occasions. I recall giving a TOEFL exam to the
                    youngest daughter of the King. She was in Berkeley last year and I reminded her
                    of that. She hadn't forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thais were devastated when they changed the name of the
                        program to USICA. They couldn't understand it all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KENDALL: That was one of the worst administrative decisions to come out of our
                    Washington headquarters. I was certainly glad when the name was changed back to
                    USIA.</p>
                <p>1979: Retirement; Employment With University of California's Institute Of East
                    Asian Studies</p>
                <p>I went to Bangkok thinking that I would be able to remain on post until I reached
                    retirement age at 65, but early in 1979 there came the Supreme Court decision
                    that we had to retire at 60. Since I was turning 60 in December of that year I
                    started searching for something to do. I was not ready to retire. I was still
                    strong, vigorous, healthy, and eager to continue. But I also wanted to maintain
                    the Asian connection. I drew on my academic contacts and wrote to Bob Scalapino
                    offering him my services. He wrote back saying, “I'm going to be in Bangkok on
                    July 4. Why don't we talk about it then.” We did, and I've been at Berkeley
                    working with him as coordinator of international conferences for the Institute
                    of East Asian Studies since May of 1980. Naturally, my contacts built up over 29
                    years with USIA and especially during my final 10 years in Asia have been
                    invaluable to me in this position. To tell the truth, I still consider myself a
                    member of the USIA team.</p>
