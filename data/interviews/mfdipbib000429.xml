                <p>PAUL GOOD</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 3, 2000</p>
                <p>Copyright 2001 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is August 3, 2000. It's an interview with Paul L. Good, G-O-O-D. To
                    start this off, could you tell me when and where you were born?</p>
                <p>GOOD: I was born in a house in Wilmore, Kentucky in the year 1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wilmore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Wilmore, with an e. W-I-L-M-O-R-E. My father was in divinity school at
                    Asbury College. Mom had finished her bachelor's degree and they were about ready
                    to go to the mission field. I was born in February. Dad left the seminary that
                    spring and went out to raise money for his first assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's track a little bit. Could you give me the
                        backgrounof your father first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Dad comes from Oregon, the son of a farmer, grandson of a farmer, and had
                    gone to a Bible school in Portland for his first formal education. Then he and
                    Mom, who had at that point finished normal school, normal school being the first
                    basic two years of university and all that's necessary to teach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she from Oregon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: She was also from Oregon, although she was born up in Republic, Washington.
                    Republic, at that time, was a town, that to get to the county seat, you had to
                    go up through Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GOOD: It's right up on the border. She and Dad had met in Monmouth, where she had
                    been going to normal school, what's now Oregon State's College of Education, I
                    guess. Dad was living on a farm in what later became, during World War II, Camp
                    Adair. The military took it over for training purposes, just outside Monmouth to
                    the east. They got married and decided to continue their education, get their
                    college degrees. Dad went on to get his Divinity, although he didn't quite
                    finish. He decided the missionary field was more important at that point, but he
                    was within a few credit hours, I think, the rest of that quarter. Then he ended
                    up getting a Doctor of Divinity from Cascade College later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What denomination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It's from the Methodist branch, but specifically at that time, it was the
                    Evangelical Church. The Evangelical Church was a branch of the Methodists, which
                    had broken off in Germany about a century before. It later joined with the
                    Brethren and those then joined with the Methodists and that's how you have the
                    United Methodist Church today. His particular denominational branch in Oregon
                    did not. It's now called the Evangelical Church of North America, but that's
                    basically Methodist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your father go to finish up his undergraduate
                        study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He went to Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky. He and motheboth finished
                    up there and then he went on to Divinity School there</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What mission areas were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It was an organization called the National Holiness Missionary Society,
                    later changed its name to World Gospel Mission because they didn't want to be
                    associated or identified with the Holy Rollers. But they had formed somewhere at
                    the turn of the century. I can remember that when we were living in Chicago, the
                    couple - Maude was a widow at that point with her daughter - living below us had
                    gone out to China with this group in 1910. Above us in that apartment house, was
                    a couple who had gone out in 1925. Dad went out in 1940.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an interesting time to have taken off for
                        China.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>GOOD: It was a very interesting time to be taking off for China, but then I guess
                    most any time was an interesting time to go off for China in the 50 years before
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You, of course, were very young now when your father went
                        off i1940. Did you and your mother go there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, we did in what I've recently seen to be a very small steamer. We went
                    docked in Seoul and then went on into Tientsin, where he was located for
                    language training. I understand that Mom and I did not get up to Peking, as we
                    called it then. Dad still has his pictures from his unit there and of course we
                    vacationed in Betzha, which is, I gather, still the vacation spot for the elite
                    of the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think Mao and company used to head off there. GOOD:
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously this is when you were, I 'd say pretty young;
                        you wervery, very young. So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, they didn't stay very long. Mom got sick. They weren't ever sure
                    quite what she got, but it ended up giving her early death when she was 46 from
                    subsequent developments. But they never knew what it was she got there. The
                    story I remember hearing was that she was in the hospital and she heard a baby
                    crying. She said, “That sounds like my baby.” It turned out I was in for worms
                    in the same hospital; they hadn't told her. From the pictures that we have, the
                    motion pictures of the time, it was a very dirty, smoggy, or not clear, not many
                    vehicles on the road, two-wheeled rickshaws of course, lots of bags of charcoal
                    being carted around, and lots of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This being the Shantung Peninsula, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was under, by 1940s, would be under the Japanese,
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, the pictures I've seen of the times showed barbed wire fences that
                    were set up. Yes, they were in charge then. This was part of the reason of
                    course for the return to the U.S. It wasn't just the illness, but they were
                    beginning to move the missionaries out. We came back in 1941. Because of Mom's
                    illness, Dad never went out again as a missionary, but he stayed with the
                    missionary organization for most of his career, retired from it eventually,
                    although he did take a few years as a pastor in Oregon before continuing with
                    it.</p>
                <p>Q: Where did you go?</p>
                <p>GOOD: After we came back from China, we went to the San Francisco area where my
                    grandfather was living in Novato, at that time just a very small town, then back
                    to Chicago, where we stayed until 1944, when Dad took a pastorate back in Oregon
                    for two years and worked for the conference for a year. Then we went back to
                    Chicago in '47. I'47 we came back to Chicago, October, Columbus Day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Chicago, this must have been about the time you were
                        reallstarting school, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I had started kindergarten before we left in 1944 and had done a first
                    semester, if you have semesters in kindergarten. When I came back, I was in
                    fourth grade.</p>
                <p>Q: What do you recall, what sort of interested you, and what type of education
                    were you getting in elementary school? In the first place, was it a public
                    school?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, it was public. Although I had started kindergarten in Chicago, when I
                    got to Oregon, my birthday put me over the hump, so I wasn't allowed to start
                    first grade that next fall. Mom signed up for the Calvert course, being a
                    teacher herself, and she gave me first grade at home. Although when I came to
                    school in Sweet Home where we were assigned, they put me into first grade for a
                    week and then decided that I'd had first grade already and put me into second.
                    It was a public school. It was a town on the edge of the mountain passes. Three
                    miles farther, you were in the mountains. It was a poor community, lumbering. I
                    remember kids coming to school barefooted that September. That was probably as
                    much because they were used to going barefooted, as not, but there was a factor
                    in there of money, not wear the shoes out until you had to, outdoor toilets for
                    the school, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the education there do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I would think pretty good. I remember we had phonics, which I recommend,
                    and which my children seem not to have had. It was the only place I ever went to
                    where we had two-seat benches, two persons to a desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Good:Good old days!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to some people who have been in one and two
                        rooschoolhouses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, we were not that small. It was a brick building, and wprobably had a
                    couple hundred kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, fun. In a way, I mean faith not in a way, but while
                        yowere there you were a PK (preacher's kid) weren't you, a preacher's
                        kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I was, yes, with all the problems of being a PK. I had been an MK
                    (missionary's kid), now I was a PK. While I didn't know what that was all about,
                    I knew that Dad preached on Sunday, I had to behave in church, people brought
                    things for us, chickens and so forth as part of their offerings, I suppose, and
                    there were lots of people around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that intrude on your play activities or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, not really, no. Sundays was the only time it evehappened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, by that time, I had two brothers. When we got back to Chicago, just
                    before we left Oregon, I got a third brother. Mom had had two children that did
                    not survive. I think one was stillborn, and the other one died shortly
                    thereafter. Both of those were girls. There were more that came later; we had a
                    total of seven.</p>
                <p>Q: Oh! What about in the home, I'm talking about the elementary school period?
                    Did you sit around and talk about events, or read books, or what sort of
                    things?</p>
                <p>GOOD: We always read. That was Mom's doing, I suspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good schoolteacher!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>GOOD: She was a good schoolteacher. Yes, books were important, and we did a lot
                    of reading. We didn't discuss current events that I remember. Dad wasn't the one
                    that we communicated with, partly because I guess he was at work and Mom was
                    always home. She didn't work at all. She had taught a bit before she got
                    married, and she did some substitute teaching later in life, but she did not
                    work when the kids were growing up.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you recall any sort of books or subjects that in elementary school, pretty
                    early on, but any of these that sort of caught your attention?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, being a preacher's kid, we were focused on religious books, small
                    novels, short novels. I don't remember going to a library until we got back to
                    Chicago and I was probably in the sixth grade. I didn't go to a library in Sweet
                    Home in Oregon; I don't know that they had one. Of course, we weren't wealthy,
                    and so books were not plentiful. We would get a book as a birthday present,
                    perhaps one at Christmas. There were series of books; the Sugar Creek Gang comes
                    to mind. These weren't the Hardy Boys Series; they were religiously oriented.
                    Zondervan Press I think was the one putting them out. We would collect these
                    series as new books would come out in the series, and we were interested in
                    getting them, like the Harry Potter today; far less sophisticated, but the
                    stories were there, they were interesting, and we liked them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The situs for the stories was Michigan. I guess ZondervaPress is up
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, they were kids. It wasn't as sophisticated as the Nancy Drew Series,
                    although we did read that. That was okay. We didn't have the Hardy Boys; I don't
                    know why.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tom Swift?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We didn't have Tom Swift either. I heard about it later, but we didn't have
                    them at home. I didn't really start going to the library heavily until I was in
                    seventh grade I suppose. It was only down a couple blocks from us in Chicago, so
                    it was easy.</p>

                <p>Q: When you went to Chicago, as you say this is by the time you're in seventh
                    grade, so you would have been what, about ten years old or so?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Let's see, I finished grade school in 1951. I was 12 when I started high
                    school. In '47 we got there, so I would have been eight. Started my paper route,
                    at ten I guess. Back in the days when in Chicago, Mom would let me go downtown,
                    when I was 12, all by myself. We were living in Austin, which was the West Side
                    District, next to Oak Park.</p>
                <p>Andrew Greeley, if you know that author priest, turned out to be growing up
                    there. He is just a few years older than I. But I felt an affinity with his
                    books without knowing at first why I felt comfortable with them. I'm not
                    Catholic, but some of my classmates must have known him well as a kid because
                    they went to the parish that he worshiped.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Andrew Greeley, the sociologist from the University of Chicago, who has
                    done a number of types of work, a sociologist by profession, didn't get along
                    well with the head of the church in Chicago. When he tried to give a million
                    dollars to the Church there for educational purposes, the Cardinal wouldn't let
                    them take it. (Laughing)</p>

                </p>
                <p>Good: Cardinal wouldn't take that kind of money, said it was cominfrom the wrong
                    sources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing) What was the other one, it was the Studs
                        Lonigan Serie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a little older, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The school system in Chicago was fantastic. I remember Carl Sandburg came
                    to our grade school to read poetry. We went down to a radio station to watch
                    shows put on; we went to television stations to watch live shows. The White
                    Stallion Series, Jim Farley, who was, I remember, one of the authors that they
                    were interviewing the day we went down to watch the shows being produced on
                    radio.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>But we were very white. We had lots of ethnic groups. The area where we moved to
                    in Chicago, Austin, had been Scandinavian, Swedish; it was becoming Italian. The
                    last time I went back it was black. One Swede still lived across the alley from
                    where we had lived, and I was talking to a fellow that lived in our apartment.
                    He said, “They're taking good care of her, an old lady now.” I suppose the
                    Latins are on their way, because they move out from the center of town. Now
                    north of us, above Augusta Avenue, you had Eastern Europeans, you had the Poles
                    and the Czechs. But they didn't come across Augusta, so we didn't have them in
                    our school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were real sorts of racial ethnic in all divides,
                        sort oin there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, color was not an issue, because we didn't have any colored, but Jews
                    were picked on. I can remember seeing one of our Jewish classmates being
                    harassed. I didn't know why they were doing it, because I hadn't had any
                    involvement with that before. I'd been a small town boy up to that point and I
                    didn't know why they were picking on him. His father was a banker, he was young
                    for his grade as well and a little bit overweight, and it all came together. He
                    was the one to pick on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They were excellent, tough, and all female in Chicago. I can't remember
                    having a male teacher until high school. The female teacher that I first
                    remember was in fourth grade. I came back, as I said, to Chicago and started
                    fourth, 1947, a little bit late that year because we had to wait for my third
                    brother to be born, and we could transfer back. So I had started that year in
                    Hood River, Oregon, with my aunt. Then I'd moved down for a week of school
                    before we left in Oak Grove, just outside Portland. After Columbus Day I joined
                    in with the class in Byford Elementary. It was about two blocks from the house,
                    to which we could walk, past the car-painting garage, which was pumping out that
                    wonderful smell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Paint.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Then we didn't get highs on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>GOOD: But I can see why people were going to it later.</p>
                <p>My teacher had a personal tragedy. I guess her husband died. In my naive way, I
                    thought that what she did then must have come as a result of that in some way,
                    some sympathy, or something. She double promoted me. A double promotion in
                    Chicago meant a half year increase, not a full year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there were A and B classes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: A and B classes and so you could start in September and you could start in
                    January. So I hopped. Instead of going to four A, I went to five B I guess,
                    which put me on a half year off base. The second teacher that I really remember
                    is the one I had in summer school to finish eighth grade to get back in synch,
                    so I could go off to boarding school for high school. She had been instructor at
                    the navy facility during World War II there in...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, the Treasury Pier or whatever it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The Treasury Pier, yes, right out into Lake Michigan.Actually the
                    University of Illinois has a campus there now.</p>
                <p>She was used to discipline problems. Now the summer school class, now this is
                    Chicago and you know how hot it is in Chicago in the summer, brick buildings and
                    no air conditioning, was made up mostly of losers, kids who had failed their
                    last year. The fellow behind me in my row was 18, and I was 12. He would collect
                    papers. One day I noticed that he didn't turn mine or his in. He was using mine
                    to do his. I said to the teacher I didn't think this was right. She said, “Never
                    mind, he needs help,”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Good: “So he needs to get through.” But she was a tough teacher. This was the
                    kind of place where, in the breaks, the recess in the morning, we'd go out and
                    these guys would pitch, not pennies, they'd pitch quarters!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, they had big money, huh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They had some big money, that's right. You know what pitchinmeans, with the
                    cracks in the sidewalk and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Otherwise the most impressive remembrance of adults in school was the
                    policeman on the corner. I was a patrol boy. We would come from our various
                    stations, and he would be there to take us all across the final street to
                    school. Every payday he would flip quarters. I think he would give out two, and
                    you had to call it right three times in a row to get your quarter. But I grew up
                    with a very positive feeling toward police.</p>

                <p>GOOD: No. I don't remember that at all. I remember everything was smooth. We
                    didn't have any problems. My paper route took me out to Cicero and Bell Park on
                    the west side. I don't remember politics at all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Not really, no, it wasn't. It was probably as good in the foreign news
                    department as The Tribune; it was certainly more balanced. It wasn't tabloid;
                    there was The Sun Times, which was tabloid.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Except on Thursdays, the paper was okay; Thursday's was a heavy day. I
                    remember that well, because although we didn't have many papers, 50, 55,
                    something like that, when it was a snowy time you could not take those papers in
                    a bike. You couldn't have stood up on the bike. So you had these sleds, and
                    these papers would fill a small sled, which you had to pull along. The only
                    street that gave us trouble was Washington Boulevard, which had enough traffic
                    to keep it cleared. Hauling a sled with papers across a cleared street was not
                    always so easy.</p>
                <p>Q: When you went to Cicero, did the reputation live up to its name? In those
                    days, I mean, one thinks of Al Capone living in or working out of Cicero. Was it
                    a pretty quiet place?</p>
                <p>GOOD: It was very quiet; I didn't go in very far. You went across Madison Avenue
                    where the electrified trolleys, ran to get across there. I didn't go in farther.
                    It seemed a little bit more genteel than the part just north of it in Chicago.
                    Washington Park was what I followed along on the right. The west side of that
                    road going south were high rise apartments, to which I'd have to try to throw
                    papers up on the third floor back balconies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a little sociological note, was there a problem being

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: None, whatsoever, none. Now that caused problems for my brother. I remember
                    when we got to Marion, Indiana. The people there were scandalized that my mother
                    would let my five-year-old brother walk downtown by himself. She didn't think
                    twice about it, because she knew that he had street smarts from being in
                    Chicago, because we lived in an urban area. There weren't all that many streets
                    to cross in Chicago. If you know the Chicago blocks, it takes eight of them to
                    make a mile; they're pretty long. So your neighborhood had just a couple of
                    streets involved. I've gone back and we found we had been about four blocks from
                    the el (elevated train). We were close to Chicago and Central. That's not a very
                    great distance now, but as a kid to go to the el was a trip. We also could get
                    to the ice-skating ponds. They would fill a park depression in wintertime and
                    you'd go ice skate. It was quite an adventure.</p>

                    want to get across if we could help it. Central wasn't as bad. It was just, for
                    a kid, quite a ways.</p>

                    down as far as Houston, and came back as far as Atlanta, and then returned to
                    Chicago. But on the way back we stopped at a place called Mount Carmel, which is
                    a Christian, protestant, fundamentalist boarding school. It had been set up in
                    about 1925 to reach the United Scotch Irish - people who were living in isolated
                    “hollers,” as they called them in Kentucky.Some of the founders Dad knew, and
                    some of the ones that had come after, had been classmates of his at Asbury. So
                    he was really stopping there to see his old friends.</p>
                <p>I saw the place, and I liked it for two reasons. One, in Chicago, there was the
                    beginning of some crime, minor at that point, except for one tale, and I've
                    never been back to check it. But we were told that a girl had been killed,
                    dropped off of a railroad trestle after a high school game. I think it was in
                    1950. I was 12, and although I was of a size, I was larger than the normal 12 I
                    suppose, I didn't look forward to that kind of environment; I was scared. Two, I
                    guess being the oldest in an increasingly large family; my first sister came in
                    fall of '51; I was looking to get out of the house. Now that wasn't fair to my
                    parents, but it was a small apartment. We had two bedrooms and an enclosed porch
                    large enough for a double bed or bunk bed. Here we are getting more crowded and
                    to get away sounded like a wonderful idea! Dad didn't have much money, and they
                    didn't charge much. It was only, I think, $20 a month for school, and he was
                    able to eke that out. There were other missionary associations. My first
                    roommate was an MK.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. MK is a missionary kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Missionary kid, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's right. Those are well understood by other MKs and PKs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. Were these two rather distinct societies, the

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, because when you saw the missionaries, the missionaries were divorced
                    from their place of occupation. They were sophisticated world travelers. They'd
                    bring me things like an elephant skin wallet, or a stuffed baby alligator.
                    Preachers were people who were leaders in a community and under the eyes of the
                    parishioners, so the kids had to behave. Missionary kids that I saw and met were
                    away from their communities. They were expected to behave obviously, but they
                    did bring with them an aura of having been there, someplace, that the rest of us
                    didn't know about. A couple of my roommates in high school, when they wanted to
                    talk, they were brothers, to each other on something private, they switched to
                    Swahili. Very annoying.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing) Yes. What was the name of the school you went

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Mount Carmel High School. It's located near Jackson, Kentucky in the hills
                    north of Harlan County, which of course might be remembered as “the place of
                    summit rest” under John L. Lewis. Jackson is in “bloody Breathitt County,”
                    Breathitt County. Bloody Breathitt got its reputation from family feuds.</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>GOOD: It was very disciplined, very gender conscious, very religious, very
                    regimented, good teachers, and dedicated teachers. Some of them, most of them
                    were very well qualified. They had a good engineer there teaching math. My
                    favorite teacher who just died this year was from Wisconsin. Good education in
                    Wisconsin, he taught humanities. One of Dad's old classmates taught typing and
                    shorthand; she was the executive secretary for the organization. There was a
                    Bible school attached to the cluster, radio station, and a farm made up the
                    group. It's still there. My 45th high school reunion was this month. It was
                    small. We had about 125 students in total.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Male, female?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Both, but we lived on different sides of the campus. There were a few day
                    students, not very many. Most were boarding, girls and boys never the twain
                    should meet. We sat on opposite sides of the table in the dining hall; we sat on
                    opposite sides of the classroom, opposite sides of the chapel.There was no
                    dating of course. We didn't have pepper. The story was that pepper made you
                    flirtatious. I think it was more likely the cost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I suppose the saltpeter in the food and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:I mean this is (laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: As seniors you could, if you were legally in a public place like the front
                    of the dining hall practicing the piano, maybe able to carry out a conversation
                    with one of your classmates who was also a senior. But it was very segregated.
                    The fellows worked; we had to work one day a week. Monday was workday, Saturday
                    was a school day; the only place I've been like that. We'd work on the rock
                    pile. They'd blast and take the rock out, and put it in the rock crusher, and
                    then they'd take it to use it on the roads, because we were isolated. We had a
                    strongly supported swinging bridge, which was just wide enough to pass a Crosley
                    car across. You remember the Crosleys from Muncie, Indiana?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, oh, yes, very little.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GOOD: Very little, and it could squeeze across. They had built it, I think, to
                    fit a Crosley so they could have some way of bringing it to school, because the
                    back road, which today is paved very nicely. You could bring a four-wheel drive,
                    three-quarter ton truck through the backroad. The school maintained it. That is
                    one of the reasons for the gravel. The school put in culverts and tried to get
                    the road standard up. Today, the swinging bridge is no longer used. A female
                    governor of Kentucky for some reason brought in a good bridge about 150 feet up
                    the river from where the swinging bridge was. So you can drive in easily now,
                    from both directions. The town is actually located in Lawson, Kentucky. The
                    Lawsons were a family, maybe ten or 12 people I guess, and they had a post
                    office, and they donated the land to the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been an awful lot of passing of notes to
                        thgirls and back and forth, wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no, no. There was very, very little. I don't remember any of that. We'd
                    mildly flirt across the room before class would start, but no notes.I had a date
                    with one of my classmates who was in nursing school in Ohio, one Thanksgiving a
                    couple of years later. I saw her once more after I'd started teaching.</p>
                <p>I saw my roommate, one of my roommates from high school, down in Bolivia. When I
                    was assigned to Chile, I went up to see them. His wife and I went on a date in
                    college in Oregon. She was the daughter of the American missionary I mentioned
                    earlier who'd gone out in 1925. I sent her a nickel in 1945, and she sent me
                    back over 2,000,000 yuan. There was a bit of inflation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How fundamental, and could you explain what
                        fundamentameant, was this school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, there are five basic rules that define the fundamentalists. In
                    general, it's someone who takes the Bible literally; who believes the second
                    work of grace is a distinct act, not something you grow into, like the Baptists
                    believe. They also believe that Jesus is the true Son of God, that Mary was a
                    virgin at Jesus' birth, and that at communion the wine turns to blood.Although
                    at the time I didn't focus on it, I imagine creationism was their line as well.
                    It was disciplined; it was many services a week, prayer at every possible
                    occasion, where speakers tended to be religious, visiting missionaries for
                    example, inspirational talks, we had testimony services on Wednesday evening
                    especially for that, although they could happen at any time. They were very
                    literate, but and you weren't encouraged to have any different ideas. Now they
                    weren't fanatical, in the sense that they weren't into snake worship as was not
                    uncommon in that area of the country. They were not opposed, however, to
                    speaking in tongues. I can remember at least one instance in which that or
                    manifestation of that took place in one of our Bible services. It scared me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, because we never really knew what was going on at that point. We didn't
                    have female counselors. Our dorm associates were all male and fairly young, in
                    their early mid-20s, except for the engineer who was older. He felt ancient to
                    us at that time; I suppose he was in his mid-40s!</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But they were very strict, and we were isolated, so we had no contact with
                    town. We, on occasion, set out into the woods. Chestnuts were dying and could be
                    pushed over and brought back to be cut up for fence posts. We were too far to
                    walk to town. It was unsettled country; it was just hills. It would have taken
                    you a good while to get town if you tried; we didn't try. We were at the end of
                    a road; there was no way out for us; we had no vehicles. It was really too far
                    to go out, because if you got out to the highway from where you were, you were
                    at the highway! You weren't in town and you had another number of miles to go to
                    get into town.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But prayer and the Bible were what we spent a lot of time at. School
                    activities, if you were a leader, then that was the thing you aimed for, to be
                    student body president. The equivalent was to be the youth organization
                    president, which involved running the church service on Sundays. The chance to
                    be that was the major reason I returned for a fourth year.</p>
                <p>We worked at other things, mashing potatoes for example. I'd get out early from
                    the service to go down and get the potatoes ready for the lunch meal on
                    Sundays.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they training preachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, preachers and farmers. We had a contingent of kids from northern Ohio
                    farming area. We had some from Indiana, some from Michigan, as was evident when
                    I went to the last reunion. One of my classmates is a teacher, another retired
                    as a steelmaker. My last roommate became a county clerk. He's the county clerk
                    for Breathitt County now.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. You know, that's always an age when kids love to challenge, and I would
                    think that a fundamental school would be a great place to sort of say was,
                    “Well, was Jonah really swallowed by a whale?” and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Didn't have that. I had a roommate that probably had a propensity for that.
                    He was from Georgia, I think, and he just never could shut up. But I don't
                    remember any of that. Some of the kids came back and talked about having back
                    slid during the summer and had a lot of fun. Clearly what was fun was bad; no
                    question about that. If you liked it, you shouldn't do it.</p>

                    Episcopalian monks. You know, church once a day and twice on Sundays.</p>
                <p>GOOD: That leads the young.</p>

                <p>Q: No, I went back for my 50th reunion, and remember going into the dorm, where
                    we stayed, with my wife. I went in there in the bathroom or something, and in
                    the toilet group was a sanitary napkin dispenser, and I thought, “My God,
                    (laughing) life has gone, really changed.”</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, well, high school was the first time I'd seen a shower.We got
                    three-minute showers with the water supply.</p>
                <p>Q: '51 to '55 the Cold War was really heating up. We're talking about the Korean

                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, though that had to wait till later. We were aware of the world only to
                    the extent that we heard about it from some of the missionary kids who were
                    students at the school and missionaries who might come in to talk about their
                    experiences.</p>
                <p>We got fooled, or the school got fooled once. I must have been a senior that
                    year. A missionary, a speaker, a native Lebanese, came through on a fund raising
                    trip and apparently absconded with $350,000 that he collected during his tour.
                    It had nothing to do with world politics, but it certainly didn't do the
                    Lebanese reputation in the U.S. any good</p>

                </p>
                <p>Good: No, we didn't have radios; we didn't have any tape recorders. Of course,
                    television wasn't around; it wouldn't have been able to be received in those
                    mountains anyway. I remember that transistor radios existed. Somebody had one or
                    had at least a transistor to show us what a transistor was, but we were not
                    allowed to have radios. The dorm master had a radio in his room of course.
                    Movies? Of course, we didn't have movies at all; film strips, no filmstrips. We
                    had no audiovisual materials. In the science we had a primitive lab, not much
                    there. It was really the professor's, (teacher's) table to do some experiments
                    on. We didn't have hands on stuff at all.</p>

                <p>GOOD: We read all the time. There was a library there, which we used. We were
                    busy though. If you've got to get up and go get on your knees first off, and
                    then you've got to go to breakfast and have some more spiritual time, and then
                    you're going to classes, and then you might have to put in some work after
                    school, some manual labor that you needed to do, and then you had study hall,
                    supervised study hall two hours a night over in the classroom building, then
                    there wasn't a lot of extra time. We had to work eight hours a week or pay ten
                    cents for each you failed to work.</p>

                <p>Q: You either thrive or don't thrive in an environment like this. How did you
                    take to it?</p>
                <p>GOOD: I loved it, after my first month. Dad came down, I was too homesick my
                    first month, and he came down to visit at the end the month and reassured me.
                    Then it was okay to the extent that although I had completed my credits
                    necessary for graduation at the end of the third year, I insisted on taking the
                    fourth. To have missed out on the senior year was to have missed out on the
                    culmination of what the school is all about. I also, of course, had some courses
                    I felt I should have taken, like physics. My folks didn't object really because
                    at that point I'd be 15 and a little bit young to be going to college. But I had
                    entrance into the school I did go to the next year, Cascade College out on the
                    West Coast, with a scholarship, because the administration out there were old
                    friends of Dad's.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you apply for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I didn't apply. Dad got me an invitation to go to CascadCollege. That was
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh! Where is Cascade College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Cascade was in Portland, Oregon on Killingsworth Avenue, across from
                    Jefferson High School. The campus is now a part of the community college system
                    in Portland. It had been the Bible school originally that Dad had gone to; it
                    expanded to a four year college. It was certainly not a class school, but it was
                    a friendly school. As I said, many of the teachers and administration were
                    friends of Dad's or were affiliated with the churches that Dad had been familiar
                    with. So I didn't feel out of place. It collected students from Washington,
                    Idaho, and Oregon, mostly.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>GOOD: Cascade had ties with the Methodist organization. Dad's connection with its
                    teachers and administrators had been built at Asbury College, the Methodists'
                    school in Kentucky. Although Cascade wasn't, as far I know, affiliated with
                    either the Methodist church or the Evangelical church, which was sort of a
                    Methodist church in Oregon.. I don't remember it being associated with any
                    particular church. It had active connections, affiliations in the sense that
                    speakers would come from various mission organizations and churches, and
                    certainly they expected all the students to be going to church. It wasn't a
                    religious school, but nobody who went there didn't know what being saved meant.
                    They presumed that almost everybody was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find you'd been going at Mount Carmel to, as you
                        said, rather restrictive school? Was this an opening up school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, I got myself fully prepared for Cascade academically, but that wasn't
                    the problem. I again was still young, and my classmates were not coming from
                    boarding schools. They were coming from public high schools, and were more
                    worldly wise than I. I didn't mention that by the time I came home from my first
                    year at high school, Dad and his organization had moved, from Chicago to Marion,
                    Indiana, and I came home to nobody, except my immediate family, of course. I
                    knew no one and I really didn't have a chance to meet very many, other than a
                    couple kids from church, for all the time I lived there. Ultimately I go a
                    Master's degree in the area at Ball State. I did go to a year of Taylor
                    University in Upland, Indiana for my second year of college, and I met people
                    that were commuting with me. But I was not a part of the Marion public school
                    scene until I did student teaching in 1959. I hadn't had any real contact with
                    public high schools. I didn't fit in that well at first with the students at
                    Cascade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. Was it a coed school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It was a coed school. It wasn't large. I don't know, probably a few
                    hundred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again now, what were your interests there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, for some reason I'd gotten the idea that I was called to be a doctor,
                    a missionary doctor, of course. I was soon disabused of any interest in science.
                    That was probably the major lesson of my first year; I didn't like it. My
                    teammate in biology class, zoology class was a Korean vet, quite a bit older. He
                    went on to become a Ph D, professor in New Jersey, science being such fun for
                    him. He just walked circles around me. I just felt totally unprepared. I think
                    he'd been a medic. So I tuned out of that idea, it had been sort of a
                    brainwashing thing.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The idea that you had a calling was something that you wanted to attain in a high
                    school like Mount Carmel. If you didn't have a calling, you must have done
                    something, or were doing something wrong, probably weren't even a Christian. So
                    that's what I went there to do. I didn't go to Cascade my second year.</p>
                <p>I went back to Indiana. I went to a university. The summers before and after my
                    freshman year at college, I went to work on a farm for a high school classmate
                    of Dad's; I didn't have a lot of drive. On the way home after the summer, I left
                    I think in mid August, at the time that they were having the Republican National
                    Convention in the Cow Palace at San Francisco that year, which is '56.</p>

                <p>GOOD: My roommate's father was a caretaker of a ranch outside of Davis,
                    California and I stopped to see him on the way back to Indiana, went down by
                    train, continued on by train. That was a political event I remembered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The only political events I remember from grade school were the firing of
                    MacArthur and the death of Roosevelt. I think I remember the death of Roosevelt.
                    I can't think of anything else it could have been.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: There were some very angry vets in the apartment house next door. The
                    father of one of my classmates was very upset about this action of Truman, so it
                    forced its way into my mind.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were at Cascade your freshman year, were you getting, reading the
                    San Francisco papers, or getting a feel for the world outside there?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, I don't remember reading a paper in Portland, normally. It wasn't until
                    I was, I think, teaching that I began to educate myself by thorough filing of
                    Time Magazine articles, current events, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Taylor your second year, your sophomore
                        year,what were you doing there, getting away from the sciences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, I think I probably was interested in home. I missed Mom, I hadn't lived
                    at home for five years. I guess I needed to have a little bit of home, and we
                    had a little more room there than we had had in Chicago. Not a lot more, but we
                    had a house instead of an apartment. We had two doors and a back yard. So, yes,
                    it was.</p>
                <p>Dad bought me a 1949 Ford to drive to school. Taylor was about 15 miles away from
                    Marion. Taylor was a more serious school and it was a more sophisticated. There
                    were teachers that had a little bit more trained. I think the school certainly
                    had been around longer and more tradition to it, but it was still Christian.
                    Still, they tried to get you to go to chapel, but because I was commuting, I
                    didn't go much. I sort of, at that point, tuned out of religion.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Was there sort of a divide between the “Christians” and “non-Christians?”
                    I'm not talking about, I mean, those that were saved and those that maybe went
                    to church on Sundays. Now then, did you feel you were part of an elect group or
                    not?</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>GOOD: At Taylor, no, I think everyone there was considered Christian, or they
                    wouldn't have been going there. It wasn't, as far as I know at that time,
                    affiliated with any church; it may have been some time in the past. But it was
                    certainly involved in missionaries and preachers. Most if not all of our student
                    body, unless they had been living in the town of Upland itself, would probably
                    have come from really the same Christian background. Certainly the people I
                    commuted with from Marion had been brought up to be at church. One of my Mt.
                    Caramal roommates has been a professor there for decades. He was the Swahili
                    speaking one who was brought up an MK [missionary kid] in East Africa. He went
                    to grade school with one of our recent ambassadors in Rwanda, also and MK.</p>
                <p>After Taylor, I went back to Cascade and finished my degree after three years of
                    college.. I had taken correspondent courses after my first summer and my second
                    summer, and then took summer school my third summer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I went back to Cascade. I didn't graduate that June (1958), because I
                    didn't have enough credits, but I had enough credits by the end of the summer. I
                    started my Master's program that fall living at home in Marion, IN and went to
                    Ball State. I returned for graduation ceremonies with my Cascade classmates in
                    the spring of '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were getting ready to get out of Cascade,
                        time tgraduate, did you have a major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: In Cascade I was going toward history. It didn't matter the freshman year,
                    but my sophomore year I was pushing toward history, and certainly my senior year
                    I did, with a minor in English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular field of history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, generally American history, not much foreign history. I remember a
                    class in medieval historWorld history, of course, I took in correspondent
                    courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At any point was there any part of the world you were
                        looking at,for example China or elsewhere, or was this not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, China would be the place I looked at, if I looked anywhere. I was, of
                    course, overwhelmed by the depth of the knowledge necessary to know China. I'd
                    steered away from focusing on Chinese history or anything to do it, especially
                    in Asia, all the way through because I felt that it was too late to learn. You
                    needed to have the language and to know as much as you needed to know; it was a
                    never-ending fight. I remember Dad's friend Jack Trachsel, whose daughter I
                    dated at Cascade, and who married a Cascade roommate, had wonderful Chinese. I
                    think he'd spent 50 years over there. But he said he never felt that he was
                    fluent, really fluent. He could preach in the language, but he said there's so
                    much more to know. I remember talking to a professor at the University of
                    Washington when I was teaching high school in Oregon (1959-1961). He was just
                    overwhelmed. The Japanese were publishing a volume a day from the archives of
                    ancient books in Chinese. And he said, “Look at those shelves. I'm getting a new
                    book a day. How am I supposed to read all that information? I can't read it.
                    It's too much.” Now he had his Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) in Chinese Studies,
                    so I never felt that I was capable of becoming what I thought you had to become
                    to be a specialist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You graduated actually; did you intend you went back
                        tCascade to graduate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, after my Ball State year, I went back to get married and do a summer
                    of courses to finish my credits for the Master's program. I started teaching
                    that fall of '59. I had spent that year of '58-'59 at Balls State, doing my
                    Master's program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you meet your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: She was the daughter of the preacher at a church where I played the organ
                    on Sundays my freshman year. It was my German church. He was a German professor
                    at Cascade. I had met her my freshman year but hadn't dated. Then the second
                    time I went back to Cascade I sought her out, dated, courted and got
                    engaged..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They had migrated from Germany around '52. She had been 12 when they came;
                    she had no accent. Her father had a Ph.D. from Leipzig. Her mother was a
                    gymnasium teacher in high school. As you may know, when you get past what we
                    call the Master's level, you split. If you go for your Ph.D., you go one way and
                    do a thesis. If you go for gymnasium teaching, you go the other way and are
                    expected to be qualified to teach every subject in the curriculum. When it came
                    to translating her background to the American education system, she was credited
                    with only a MA.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So she didn't teach, although she was a far better teacher than her husband, who
                    was a preacher and had been a missionary as well in Tanzania, or Tanganyika, as
                    it was at the time. He'd been an officer in the German army in WWII, drafted to
                    do that as the language specialist. He told me that the Army told him that he
                    had 90 days to learn Italian and go down to Italy to be a translator,
                    interpreter for the forces. He'd spent time in concentration camp in Scotland
                    (1945-1947), where they put their educated prisoners, and they really turned it
                    into a university. He had a great time. He didn't get out until '47, I think.
                    Back in Germany as a pastor he filled in for Pastor Niemoeller on a trip to the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Niemoeller, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He came and saw what he liked. He particularly liked the sunshine, blue
                    skies in Arizona. Of course, he ended up in Michigan and Oregon, so he didn't
                    really get what he was after, but he decided to migrate and brought the kids
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got your Master's degree in what, history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Social science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Social Science? What were you planning to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Teach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Teach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I mean what did I know about? See, my background was teaching, preaching,
                    farming, nursing, and that was all. We'd had no contact with anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No temptation to be a farmer or a preacher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no, certainly not a farmer. I had never felt called, if you will, to
                    get into the talking business in the sense of orating. You've got to talk as a
                    teacher of course, but teaching seemed to be a union card. I didn't really plan
                    to be a teacher so much as I felt I needed to have something I could earn a
                    living with. So I got my teaching credentials. I actually taught full time the
                    last semester of my Master's year. A lady got sick and was dying, so they asked
                    if I'd come in. I taught Latin and French, which I'd never had, and I think some
                    English for the rest of the semester.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Indiana. College courses were all at night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Because they were aimed at teachers mostly, who had to have aMA within ten
                    years or quit teaching.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gradually you got your Master's at, where did you get
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Ball State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ball State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: My major professor was a nephew of Senator LaFollette and his specialty was
                    German history, although that's not what I was looking for. He had a
                    photographic memory. I remember that he came in one Monday morning and said,
                    “There's a new book that just came out in German.” He read us some parts of it
                    in English. He read it off the back wall. He was just looking at the wall and
                    translating. To me it was as if he saw it in English on the back wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year did you finally get your Master's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I finished my Master's; August 15, '59. Technically, graduated with the
                    class of '60.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I started teaching in the Milwaukee High School District jusoutside
                    Portland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Milwaukee High School, but this is Milwaukee in-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Milwaukee High School District. I was teaching at Clackamas High, which was
                    a new school in the district. That's Milwaukee with an I-E, not a double E. Q:
                    Ahh!</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>GOOD: This is a town that is between Portland and Oregon City. Oregon City being
                    the town south of Portland where the falls are located, where navigation
                    stopped. There was a paper mill, still is a paper mill there. The Hudson Bay
                    Company had a posting there in the 1850s. McLoughlin was the factor.</p>
                <p>He'd retired by the fall, because that was near where the dividinline was
                    supposed to be between the U.S. and Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, “the 54-40 or fight.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The 54-40 or fight. The route through the Columbia was supposed to be the
                    dividing line. He'd actually settled along the line just a few miles south of
                    the Colombia river and south of that border.</p>
                <p>I started teaching and I taught two years at Clackamas High. It was a new school.
                    It was the second year of its existence. Journalism, English, geography, I was
                    the advisor for the yearbook and the newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the students from? What sort of background were
                        thecoming to there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We had a speckling of poor from the 82nd Street Corridor and the rest were
                    working class, middle class. Milwaukee would have had a higher economic level.
                    We were in the suburbs of Milwaukee. I guess it's come up a ways since. Of
                    course the whole area's increased in size so they have two more high schools
                    now. I taught two years. I got my General Certificate for teaching in Oregon,
                    good for five years. To do that I had to take a few courses at Portland State to
                    fulfill those requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your wife doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: She was finishing nursing school. She had done two years at Cascade
                    pre-nursing, and then gone to the University of Oregon to finish the nursing
                    degree, a Bachelor of Science, RN (Registered Nurse), Public Health Nursing,
                    which was a three year program on top of the two, so five years altogether.
                    She's actually back there now as the supervisory nurse in the VA (Veterans
                    Administration) Hospital, which is a part of what is now a medical school. We
                    lived two blocks from the nursing school. I committed to Clackamas High.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you take to teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>GOOD: I liked it, I think I did all right with it, but I felt that I didn't know
                    enough. I knew I hadn't gone to first-rate schools, and I knew that I hadn't any
                    first hand experience. What I knew was from books. I'd gone to school; after
                    schooling, I came directly to teach. We had a drama teacher, who had spent
                    twenty years I think it was in the Merchant Marines, and he had all kinds of
                    stories and experience, and I was jealous. I didn't feel I was doing the best
                    for the students because I didn't have first hand knowledge.</p>
                <p>I first decided to go back to the university to get a Ph.D. and went to the
                    University of Arizona on a fellowship in Tucson after two years at Clackamas and
                    did a doctoral year. I had originally thought of doing my doctorate at the
                    University of Oregon. Actually, I had even had my room ready to rent down there
                    after I had finished college, but changed my mind at the last minute and went
                    back to Ball State. But U of A offered me the scholarship or fellowship.</p>
                <p>My wife had one quarter to go to finish her program, because she had to take out
                    a quarter to have our first child. So she stayed up in Portland to finish that.
                    Grandma helped take care of the baby. At Christmas I went back, and we drove
                    back down, and I finished the year.</p>
                <p>That spring I took the Foreign Service exam in Phoenix. I took the oral in Los
                    Angeles. I went over to LA (Los Angeles) to take that oral by going on Highway
                    Two across northern Mexico. A buddy and I weren't sure about gas stations, so we
                    carried a can of gas with us. It was a station wagon, so I had to leave the back
                    window open a hair to keep the fumes out. Shifting from the dry air of the
                    Arizona desert with that air coming into the car all the way across the
                    mountains over Tijuana, I had upper laryngitis like you wouldn't believe. I got
                    to the oral exam the next morning; I literally had to restart sentences. But
                    they were understanding. We spent a good deal of time talking about German
                    Methodism and for some reason or other I guess one of the guys on our panel, had
                    just come back from a tour in Germany. After an hour the panel told me to wait
                    while they made their determination and then told me I'd passed.</p>
                <p>But meanwhile, not having received an offer, I signed a contract to go back to
                    Clackamas to teach. Then came the offer to start in September 1962, but I felt
                    obligated to teach at least till Christmas that year. I came in January of
                    '63.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple questions, one is, why the Foreign Service? How
                        did yohear about it and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, Foreign Service, in the sense of living abroad, was something that I
                    had been hearing about all my life, because of missionary kids, so it was
                    enticing. I felt that going overseas to learn more social science was as
                    reasonable as learning in the States. I remember that there was some propaganda.
                    I had taken my first Foreign Service exam when I was an undergrad my second year
                    of Cascade, third year of college. I was just a kid, 19 years old, but there
                    must have been some propaganda advertising the test, so I took it. In my first
                    year of teaching, I took the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) exam. The brought
                    me to D.C. for an interview. A CIA officer showed up at my first Foreign Service
                    exam to pitch their option. I went down to their office in the federal building
                    downtown, this unlocked door, knocked, and a lady said, “Well, let's take the
                    test.” And then they sent me back to D.C. for interviews. The psychology
                    interview took place on the hill above state and what's now the valley for the
                    Kennedy Center. The medical annex or... They had an office up there; the
                    psychologist wanted to know when I had first had sex. I did interview down on
                    the flats on the mall where they still had the old barracks.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Temporary buildings.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Temporary buildings, yes. The CIA obviously had some othose. How many? I
                    have no idea.</p>
                <p>But to show you parochialism, I was asked by one of the officers down there,
                    because they were loaded with East Coast guys, about Robert Frost. I had no
                    clue. Who was Robert Frost? It's like somebody in the exam asked me, “What year
                    was Anthony Adverse published?</p>
                <p>First of all, I hadn't read Anthony Adverse at that time. What he said was, “A
                    year after Gone With the Wind.” Well I knew Gone With the Wind, but I couldn't
                    remember the year..</p>
                <p>Apparently the examiner liked Anthony Adverse, and I did too when I went back
                    read it afterward. But the East Coast was clearly the place where they were
                    getting most of their officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: When I went looking for someone in Portland to ask about an oral exam, I
                    could find nobody who had taken a Foreign Service oral. I found someone at the
                    Portland State University who had worked with CIA for a while; he gave me some
                    idea of what they were after in an oral, but he didn't know anything about
                    Foreign Service oral. (I now know there were retired R50s in Portland.</p>

                <p>Q: I would have thought that, from the background you told you, you would have
                    been right to flunk the written exam to begin with. The Foreign Service is
                    supposed to pick up people who pick up all sorts of small little items. Now
                    where was your strength?</p>
                <p>GOOD: I don't know; I passed the FS exam when I was 19.</p>

                <p>GOOD: I think you're right. But I passed the oral the second timwithout
                    difficulty in 1962..</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I remember the test was not as rough then as it is now. We didn't have much
                    in the way of marketing, or math, or that sort of thing, but it was beginning to
                    sneak in the second time I took the exam. I must have been strong in social
                    science and English is all I can say. But I didn't have trouble passing it. When
                    I came into Foreign Service, to find somebody from the West Coast was, you had
                    to really scratch. It just didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was worrying still that... When did you take the
                        oraexam that you passed? What year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That was in 1962. I took the written in Phoenix and the orain Los
                    Angeles.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you picking up, when you went there and were taking the exam, the sort of
                    the, I don't know how you want to call it, but the Kennedy spirit inspired you
                    or anything? We're talking about, you know, government service as a good thing.
                    “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your
                    country.”</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>GOOD: I was teaching when Kennedy was running. He came to our school, Clackamas
                    High, he did. I asked him a question. We all were of course in the gymnasium and
                    he was down at the end. We were up on the bleachers. Yes, I asked him a
                    question. He was very impressive. I remember I was able to get a television set
                    into the classroom for the Election Day. We focused on the election that year,
                    because it was a change. I remember the debate, the first debate between Nixon
                    and Kennedy. I was outside my house, I don't know what day, and it must have
                    been a weekend, because I would have been teaching otherwise. I was changing oil
                    in the car, and I had the car radio on. I was listening to the debate there. It
                    was clear that Nixon won. But I wasn't watching. TV (television) of course
                    turned it the other way. But on the radio, no problem, Nixon had him flat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon was almost a professional debater.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Kennedy had the charisma or whatever you want to call
                        it, thpersonality to come across.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He could project. He really could project. A young fellow, very stiff as I
                    remember him walking into the school that day, because of his back problem, I
                    suppose he had a brace on. But he was athletic, he was trim, he was outgoing, he
                    was pleasant, he had a sense of humor, and he dressed fashionably. He didn't
                    have that five o'clock shadow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (laughing) Poor Nixon. (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He really had a problem right there. Yes, because when I was sworn in,
                    Edward R. Murrow shook my hand. He was our director then at USIA (United States
                    Information Agency). It was impressive. It was a new sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took the exam, particularly the oral exam, were
                        yogiven a choice of USIA or State (Department) or how did that work
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That selection seems to have been made at the written exam time. There were
                    two versions of the test. As I remember it, there was an additional portion for
                    an optional portion that was focused for those who wanted to be Information
                    Agency. I have no idea, really, what one was as opposed to the other. I don't
                    remember why I made one selection over another. I have no memory. But I believe
                    it was at the Phoenix site that I saw that choice. It might have been when I did
                    the application for that, I could be wrong.</p>

                        accepted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: At the oral exam, they said subject of course to security and medical
                    clearances, but yes, they kept me waiting outside until they had made a
                    decision.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think, when you started to sweat, did you and

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: My wife was of the normal generation at that time, who went where her
                    husband went. Of course, having been born and raised in Germany, she was not at
                    all skittish about going overseas. The children, we had two by that time, were
                    not a consideration. Kids weren't what you put your life around; kids were part
                    of your life, unlike today, unlike my children's children. They went where you
                    went. They adapted wherever you went. My wife was a nurse and we didn't expect
                    her to work overseas. She didn't work overseas. Well she gave some English
                    lessons occasionally, but she was a wife and a mother. She raised the kids. She
                    did do some teaching of our oldest when we were in a country, Thailand. They
                    didn't have views of a ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Calvert system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We'd use the Calvert system again. Although he went to the local school, it
                    was more of a kindergarten type thing for him. They used him more as an English
                    resource than they taught him anything. He didn't really start school till we
                    got back to Bangkok, where he went to the American school. But no, I don't
                    remember any discussion. I wanted to join the Foreign Service, fine.</p>
                <p>Now, one thing at the exam which was interesting, they, looking at my records,
                    seeing that I come from a religious background, asked me if I would serve
                    drinks. They didn't ask me if I could drive a car. They were more interested in
                    the drinks. And what did I give up? Drinks, who cares, but driving car was
                    important. I did more driving a car my first five years in the Foreign Service
                    than I did anything else.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. I think this is always a shocker when you run across somebody who can't
                    type or can't drive a car. I mean in today's computer age this is almost unheard
                    of.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Of course.</p>
                <p>Q: This used to shock some of our local plays. You know, I went my first post was
                    Germany, and they said, “You know, when we had something to do, you'd want to
                    pull up a typewriter and start typing away.”</p>
                <p>I said, “You know in Germany the boss or whatever it is would sit there and look
                    at the typewriter and expect somebody else to type it out.”</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, just as we in the USIS (United States InformatioService) were expected
                    to be able to run a movie projector.</p>

                <p>GOOD: It's all part of it. To some extent I think that the problems I had were
                    European oriented. There really hadn't yet been that much developmental country
                    experience at that level.</p>

                    thing.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, and the older diplomats hadn't had chances at most of these countries
                    because we hadn't had posts there. They were colonies. '60 was the start of
                    African independence '58 for Guinea, but '60 for Nigeria. This was an era I was
                    taking exams to come into the foreign service. No, these people hadn't had the
                    chances in underdeveloped countrie.</p>
                <p>Q: But when you came in, you went to the Foreign Service Institute that we call
                    A100 course in the basic art. This is a new world for you. How did you, why did
                    you feel you placed, and then what was the class like?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, before you get to the class you have to talk Washington. We drove
                    across, did Christmas with her folks in Oregon, and then came across and stopped
                    to see my folks in Indiana. Everything we owned was in the car. We arrived on a
                    Friday evening here in Washington. We must have found someplace that night and
                    we went apartment looking. We didn't have any money. We scraped enough together
                    to pay a security deposit on the apartment we got.</p>

                    the A100 course. An oddity of the time was that there was a lack of coordination
                    in the training, or there was a limited number of speakers available. I'm not
                    sure which; maybe it was a combination. We had some speakers three times,
                    different courses, same lecture. They came, of course. We got the fellow who
                    talked about the UN (United Nations) three times, how close people got to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, this is Jim Bostain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Bostain, yes.</p>
                <p>We had the guy that spent as much time in his pipe filling as he did anything
                    else. No sooner had he got it lit than it went out, and he starts the procedure
                    again.</p>
                <p>We had the guy with the glass eye from the CIA who talked about swallowing the
                    baby moose, well, he didn't have to, but the chief did. This guy was in Burma
                    with the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), and they were laying the plans for
                    the troops possibly coming in. And he was smoozingy with the village leader in
                    this house. A little mouse fell out of the thatched roof and the village leader
                    popped it in his mouth and he knew that if another one fell, it was his. He was
                    also a science fiction writer under pseudonym. His involvement was propaganda. I
                    guess he was a psychologist.</p>
                <p>We thought it was too much orientation. We wanted to get out. So we circulated a
                    petition, which suggested that they get with it, cut out this duplication. If
                    they cut out the duplication, we'd get out that much sooner. I guess that it
                    took course, had effect, but it was delayed effect. It didn't do us any good. We
                    were located for the A100 course in the basement of River Place with the
                    dripping pipes of...</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: CIA was in the garage. We were in the basement. I didn't know the CIA was
                    in the garage until later. That was the A100 course. I guess we had a couple of
                    counter insurgency courses over there. A lot of our stuff was in a row house on
                    New York Avenue between 17th and 18th, across from the Octagon. It's where that
                    union building is now located, back of the corporate row houses at that time, we
                    had a couple there. The first mainframe computer for the agency was located in
                    one of those buildings. It was able to crank out payroll. That was it. And one
                    day they posted our assignments on the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you by the way been asking for anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They offered us a chance to put down preferences. And it was at that point
                    that I learned that you should put down your preference as maybe third or fourth
                    choice, because they're not going to give you your first. I didn't get any of
                    mine. I'd had some Spanish, and I was hoping to get down to South America. Of
                    course, I didn't get that. They put me into a place called Bangkok, I had no
                    idea where it was. I had to go to the map to find it.</p>
                <p>But they sent me off to language training at post, which was an experiment that
                    year. They sent off, I believe, four of us to try it to see if it would work
                    overseas. It didn't. The FSI (Foreign Service Institute) was jealous. They
                    resisted it. It also turned out to be a bit more expensive than they felt they
                    should afford. One went to Pakistan; I went to Thailand, one to Iran. Can't
                    remember where the fourth one went. I pretty well escaped the clutches of the
                    office by having my language lessons at the missionary school there in
                    Bangkok.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for USIA during your A100 course and
                        althat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, a little bit, yes. They talked to us or gave us some demonstrations
                    of SPIN (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-payoff) they call it now,
                    although they didn't call it that back then. They gave us some practice in how
                    to deal with unfriendly audiences. We, of course, were propagandized on the Cold
                    War. This was at the time when De Gaulle was trying to set up his separate
                    force. Kennedy's counterinsurgency I said was a sexy thing.</p>
                <p>Our class you asked me about earlier was fairly diverse. I think we were about
                    20. It was Class 24 I think. About a third of the class had Master's degrees.
                    There were two in the class who didn't have a Bachelor's degree, one lady and
                    one former navy, noncom. Some were over 25, and that's when I learned there was
                    an unwritten rule. They wouldn't bring you in as a seven [RS-7] if you were
                    under 25. It didn't matter what your qualifications were.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: So Paul Blackburn and I, who were under 25, I was 23, he was almost 24,
                    with Master's degrees were brought in as aides. The person who had no college
                    degree was brought in as a seven because he was older and had some experience.
                    But the rule was 25. I didn't find that out till later. It was like that rule
                    that if you were a woman, you couldn't remain in the service if you were
                    married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there was no...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: There was no rhyme or reason to that, and it wasn't really written down
                    that I ever saw, but it was there. One of our JOTs (Junior Officers of Trainees)
                    in Bangkok came in as a courtesy to the office, told the PAO (public affairs
                    officer) that she was going to get married in May. This was in December. She
                    thought that the agency might want to know so they could do some forward
                    planning. Washington instantly accepted her resignation, even though the post
                    did not want her gone. She was there. She was going to stay there until her
                    fianc� came out and they got married. All of the women from my class were gone
                    within five years. One of them didn't get married. She shifted over to OAS
                    (Organization of American States) and is still working there. But the others got
                    married and disappeared.</p>
                <p>Of the men, a good share of them made it a career. I was the last one to retire.
                    When I retired, the only person who had been in with more years in USIS' Foreign
                    Service was Paul Blackburn. He'd come in September 1962. I took off three years
                    to go to the university to get my doctorate in law.</p>
                <p>But one member of Paul's class is still on active service. She's our ambassador
                    designate to Yemen. But she of course had gotten married and so was out on
                    forced retirement for years...</p>

                    my follow-up assignment in Thailand as well.</p>

                <p>GOOD: That was back when USIA was trying to do what they thought State was going
                    to do before State did it, and then State didn't do it. That was to build a
                    three-year posting. So I was out there three years before I got home leave.
                    State was only out for two. It was too long the first time around; it was. It
                    was a traumatic time because I'd done that JOT and I was sent out of country
                    to-</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They only gave us five months overseas in language training, and we did our
                    exam on tape, sent back for evaluation at FSI, and I got two-two plus I guess,
                    which is what they were expecting from the 10-month course back here. My
                    classmates, the missionaries, and I were going to missionary school in Blue
                    House there on North Satorn and were expected to do two years of language, so
                    when they came out, they were preaching in the language. We should have had
                    more. But I don't know whether it was Washington's decision or the post's
                    decision, probably a combination of pressure from the post to get this body and
                    Washington looking at the figures and the cost of having to pay differential and
                    to pay for youR&amp;R somewhere overseas. I was then put into JO training, JOT
                    training as we called it in Bangkok. We were a large post; we ended up with 45
                    officers, largest USIS post I've ever been in, and with 240 local employees,
                    just in USIS. It was easy to bicycle us around, for there was so much in the
                    information section, and so much in the field office, and so much in the culture
                    section.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We had Jack O'Brien, followed by Lewis Schmidt. We had actually one week of
                    PAO, who just died a year ago I think it was Howard Garnish. I remember the
                    roast that USIS gave Garnish at the Oriental Hotel, on the river. I'd never been
                    to a roast before. I hadn't been in Bangkok five days, I think, they had it
                    Friday night. One of the officers, whose wife was teaching the queen's daughter
                    ballet, really tore this PAO apart. Now I got the impression that it was more
                    than a roast for him. He was venting some steam as well. The roaster, poor
                    fellow, never left Thailand. He sort of retired in place, living at the palace
                    on the Queen's money. He came down with a paralyzing disease, and the Queen was
                    most puzzled that the American government didn't have any medical plans for him.
                    So she had to pay for his whole medical problem. I think he died at post. But
                    the roast was amazing. I thought the PAO was an inoffensive, pleasant, short,
                    jolly, geographer, had a Ph.D., But I only saw him for a week, so what did I
                    know.</p>
                <p>Arriving in the country on Pan Am, we arrived in the evening of course, and met
                    by the USIS field operations officer was designated to go out and pick me up.
                    Two kids, one on my back, one walking by me; it was humid. We were dumped in the
                    Erawan Hotel, no air conditioning, chin-chucks (lizards) on the walls; it was
                    foreign.</p>

                <p>GOOD: I hadn't ever had a papaya before. Breakfast the next morning. What they
                    served was papaya. It's an acquired taste. It's okay, but the first time around
                    I didn't think I liked it.</p>
                <p>The post was quite nice. The post was located in what had been the embassy at the
                    end of WWII. Our main building was one that had been used as the combination
                    embassy and ambassador residence. They had some other buildings, all of which
                    changed over the years. We bought a new little warehouse out of petty cash,
                    while I was in the exec (executive) office there later on.</p>
                <p>I was able to study in the afternoons up on the unairconditioned porch in one of
                    the buildings, the audiovisual building. I had a chance to practice my language
                    around town. This is what I'd spend my weekends doing, so I got a lot of use. We
                    had a fair number of language-trained officers. Only had one fellow who was a
                    four-four. I thought that I'd had a three-three by the time I finished, but when
                    I came back here I found out how wonderful FSI was. They really had a memory.
                    They didn't want this experimental program to be able to show real potential.
                    They knew very well that we had been under orders in Thailand by the ambassador
                    not to speak about race relations, so we didn't have vocabulary built up on
                    that. So what did they have a test on? Race relations. So I came up with the
                    same score I'd had four years before. Never forgave Warren Yates for that.</p>

                    while I was getting a haircut. I had gone out to look at one of the historical
                    sites southwest of Bangkok that day. I'd stopped to get a haircut on the way
                    back, and they had the radio on. I was not far advanced as a language student,
                    couldn't believe what I thought I was hearing. I thought, “Can they really be
                    saying what I think I'm hearing, the president of the United States, dead?” I
                    had a long wave radio in the car, had to have both in Bangkok at that time. I
                    had both on my radio, so that when I got closer to Bangkok I got the English
                    version and found out it'd happened.</p>
                <p>So that would have been, let's see and get it straight. I finished language
                    training in November of '63, went out to post. Something happened in November of
                    '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '63 was also when Diem was killed, and there was a coup
                        iSaigon, and things started to go downhill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, that's what it was, and then the Gulf was in fall of '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because Johnson was president at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Because I was just arriving in Ubol when that took place, my first
                    assignment (November '64). So I was in JOT training from the end of the year,
                    December 1963 I suppose, until the next November.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Assistant Branch Post Officer Ubol.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's spelled U-B-O-L. L is pronounced N. Ubol Ratchathani, and that was
                    up in the Northeast. If you think of Thailand as an elephant, that was in the
                    ear. It's over next to Laos and just above Cambodia. There was a small JUSMAG
                    (Joint U.S. Military Affairs Group) contingent there, about 15 people. We had a
                    branch officer, Rob Nevitt. We had a few Australian military there as well. A
                    little later an army detachment communications group came in across the river.
                    There was also a listening post there. You know those bright young guys that
                    cause all kinds of trouble with the girls, undisciplined, but they were very
                    bright, and had languages, and they would listen. So that was what we had. But
                    the Australians were fun. The American contingent went from these 15 to about
                    5,000 troops by the time I left 18 months later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They built up because we had an F-104 repair shop there for F-104 that were
                    assisting were doing rescue missions over North Vietnam, which is rescue
                    missions for sighting people and they'd direct helicopters in on the downed
                    pilots. I was living two blocks away from the field, and at night, if you're
                    having a cocktail party, you had to stop when they roared up the jets to check
                    their repair work. Those are loud planes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We had a program which had been instituted with the purpose of solidifying
                    the ties behind their king. This, by the time Lewis Schmidt left, had been
                    pretty well been scotched by Washington because they didn't feel that this was
                    the kind of thing we should be doing. We were in effect a PR (public relations)
                    unit for the Thai government. We would pass out pictures of the king. We would
                    put up posters which had public health themes. We had comic books, which had
                    anticommunist themes. All of which were being printed in Manila by our
                    publishing house there.</p>
                <p>We were doing “molam” movies. Molam is a musical form, folk singing type thing.
                    We would hire teams to do molam films with an anticommunist, pro Thai government
                    theme, and then we would take these films with us when we went on our trips. I
                    would spend 80 percent of my time in the field. We had a fleet of cars, CJ6s,
                    that's a stretch Jeep. My car was a Jeep station wagon. These CJ6s had a
                    platform on top. They had a large water container, and they had extra gas tanks.
                    They had a generator that was tied down, screwed down in the back, because we
                    had lost a local employee, the year before I got there, when he hit a tree. The
                    generator was loose and landed on him, and he was done. So we had to carefully
                    secure the generator by nuts and bolts. We had a container for our poles on
                    which we would put up a screen, which was visible of course from both sides. We
                    had audiences on both sides of the sheet. One of my favorites was “New York, New
                    York,” a propaganda film from New York. It didn't have any words; it had some
                    music. It was a great crowd gatherer, because it was nothing they'd ever seen
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Then we'd go into molam, which pushed the message. I was programmed to fall
                    asleep when molam came on because we were working long hot days.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>We were up at 6:30, then 6:00, trying to find something to eat. We had hard tack
                    with us if we were desperate. But we tried to go on the open economy, and there
                    wasn't much in the villages. We were up in the Northeast, and in the dry season
                    it's dry and not much growing. The villagers are poor, and so what you'd have, I
                    can remember one meal in March, we had one chicken for the whole day for the
                    whole crew. So you had chicken, essence of chicken if you will; you had leaves
                    that were in this sauce, and that gave it a little flavoring; then you'd have
                    sticky rice in the baskets, which you would give to the villagers. They had a
                    top on the basket, so that when you finished what you wanted, you put the top
                    back on. It was on the string, so that you couldn't separate it from the bottom.
                    That was better because if you were full you could put the top on. But if you
                    were being served regular rice, your timing had to be just right because it was
                    offensive if you left anything, and if you cleaned it up at the wrong moment,
                    they'd put more on! Now that was bad, not only because you didn't want anymore
                    probably, but because they didn't really have enough rice to go around anyway.
                    So the sticky rice was a better deal, but you had to wash your hands quickly
                    because that became like glue. It would hours to get off if it dried on your
                    fingers. But it was very good.</p>
                <p>So we would be out for about 10 days on a trip, probably two vehicles, my station
                    wagon, in which I would carry district officials, from the amphur or district
                    led by the “nac amphoe.” There might be a doctor from the provincial
                    headquarters. There could be some inspector; they had a cultural inspector. They
                    would do their thing during the day, and we'd show our movies at night. We'd put
                    up our posters during the day. Occasionally we would have some sports equipment
                    to hand out, not often, but occasionally. We'd visit, pay our respects to the
                    monk or the monks at the local temple. We usually were camped out on what would
                    be a bandstand, if you will; it was a wooden platform. It was adjacent to the
                    temple, if you're lucky. We, of course, slept in our sleeping bags. We didn't
                    have tents. We would usually have a folding canvas cot. You'd put your sleeping
                    bag on that. So you didn't sleep past dawn because the village began to have
                    life. You learned how to take a shower with dipped water with a “pahama”
                    (rectangular cloth) around your waist and with the villagers all around you
                    watching, and how to take off that wet one and put on a dry one with the crowd
                    there watching, too. Pahamas are great. They're a six by three foot cloth that
                    you can use for any number of things. Swimming, it's swimming trunks in the
                    Mekong River; you can wrap things in it; you carry things with it; it's a belt;
                    I still wear them often, because they're so comfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a guerilla or communist movement going on while
                        yowere doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, certainly there was in Laos. Word had it that there were infiltrators
                    in northeast Thailand and north Thailand as well. I can't say that I ever
                    identified any. But I did get a meritorious honor award for serving in an area
                    which was under threat. We watched to be sure that there might not be mines on
                    the road. If we saw something on the road, we'd make sure we went around it. We
                    had Vietnamese refugees in a camp near Vientiane, which were an annoyance and a
                    worry to the Thai government. These were foreigners and they didn't particularly
                    like foreigners. They were coming from an area that had communists, so they
                    didn't know what the connections might still be. So they pretty well kept them
                    under lock and key at that camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These would be from the North Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Probably. At that time possibly I wouldn't swear to it. Probably they were,
                    but they were coming across Laos. They could have been coming from any number of
                    places.</p>
                <p>We still were able to go over into Laos for R&amp; R (rest and relaxation) if you
                    could call it that, because you had highlands over there. You'd go across to
                    Pakse and then drive up into the hill country. Tom Dooley had some health units
                    up there, Philippine doctors, nurses. You couldn't drive from Pakse to
                    Xiangkhoang on the Laos side. That had been possible in '62 still. But about '63
                    that was closed down, because it was insecure in the area to the northeast. Up,
                    of course across the Mekong, in the narrowest section of Laos, they just
                    couldn't keep it secure, so we couldn't do the driving. But we could go across
                    at Savannakhet where we had a branch post and at Pakse.</p>
                <p>I remember visiting over in Laos one night and one of the USIS local employees
                    was telling me how he was handing out ammunition. I don't know why. But somehow
                    or other we'd get involved in things that we weren't supposed to be involved
                    with.</p>
                <p>We had Air America over there. We had AID (Agency for International Development)
                    of course. Air America was U.S. cargo operation. One of their employees created
                    a pornographic novel about Air American activities. I had a copy one time; some
                    one stole it.</p>
                <p>We traveled a lot. We had in Ubol a reading room, small library. There were two
                    of us officers. When Rob left, I moved into his job as branch officer and I got
                    a new assistant.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>My wife had a child in Ubol, our fourth. That was the sad part. He was born in
                    February of 1965. The night before we left, we had a farewell party at the
                    house. We invited Australian friends over for the party. They'd just had a
                    dengue fever outbreak in the camp. For adults of course, it was painful for
                    some, but they survived. But they still were infected. A mosquito bit one of
                    them, and then our son. We went on the morning train back to Bangkok. It's a
                    12-hour ride. That Saturday night he was crying already, and he cried all
                    Sunday. We finally took him to the hospital and he never recovered, because he
                    was a kid. He had none of the immunity that doctors at the SEATO (South East
                    Asia Treaty Organization) medical unit considered kids that were born here in
                    the States had. But the Caucasian kids born in Thailand apparently didn't. They
                    did an autopsy on him to make sure that they knew what he had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, how tragic!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, terrible! Just absolutely devastated! There wasn't anything that you
                    could do! I mean, it was better that he died, because there was no treatment.
                    All they could do was give him intravenous feeding, liquids.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>GOOD: He lasted until Thursday. My wife was down there most of the time. They
                    told her on Thursday. “You can go home and get some rest.” Ten that evening they
                    called us, said, “Come back quickly.” By the time we got there, he was dead.</p>
                <p>The embassy came through though, marvelously at that point, just laid it out.
                    They took care of all the problems. They made sure that costs were covered. They
                    took care of the cremation. The problem is what to do with the urn. I still have
                    it. I have no idea what to do with it. That was a sad ending to our up country
                    stay. Actually I had been down to Bangkok for a month before that because they
                    needed help at the field operations office. We were expanding our posts to 13.
                    They needed someone with experience to set them up. I returned to Ubol to get my
                    family. Shortly thereafter we went on home leave for a couple of months, then
                    came back to Bangkok.</p>
                <p>Q: Okay, well, this is fairly a good place to stop. And I'll put at the end here
                    where we were, so we'll know where to pick it up. So we got you coming back to
                    Bangkok from home leave, is that right?</p>

                </p>
                <p>Remember a talk about Ubol?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Living in Ubol in 1965, 1966, '64 to '66, my boss had only two children,
                    and one was a baby. His house was smaller. I don't know whether there had been
                    anything more available when he went up there or not. He found me a larger
                    house, a more imposing house, no better built. It had been a Chinese merchant's
                    house, which meant that it was wooden with bars on the windows and screen.
                    Obviously not perfect screen, because of the problem that I told you earlier. It
                    was located with some yard; there was a lawn. They ultimately put up a bowling
                    alley next door before we left.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing about the location, I was half a block from the governor's
                    house. The governor was paid about the same as I was paid. He had a few more
                    perks of course that I didn't have, like a Mercedes to use, and entertainment
                    expenses, and I'm sure there was a little bit of corruption in there somewhere
                    too, but he was a nice guy. But one night I decided to survey the area two
                    blocks radius from my house, my house being the center. There were 19
                    whorehouses within that two-block radius. Now that area was off limits to the
                    troops. These weren't great whorehouses, they were shacks, and there would be a
                    small waiting room, and then like, you know, areas in back. But this kind of a
                    location so close to the governor's house astounded me. We were a block from the
                    hospital, which had been set up by the Seventh Day Adventists, and then they
                    were kicked out because the community felt that now that they had the hospital,
                    they didn't need these pushy missionaries who were buying their converts. They'd
                    give them a dollar attendance on a week's meeting. Ubol had been a center for
                    the Koreans working for the Japanese back in World War II. Prostitution had been
                    a big thing there. They had a section of town they called the A-frame, because
                    that's where the prostitution houses that had been frequented by the Korean
                    soldiers had been set. The Koreans carry their loads on A-frames.</p>
                <p>Q: A-frames, yes.</p>
                <p>GOOD: That's how it got that name. Of course these whorehouses were of all
                    styles, they did have whorehouses that specialized in preteen, if you will,
                    child prostitution. They had some that specialized in pregnant women. The costs
                    that I remember, they tell me, probably 50 cents.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: A very different society, yes. One of the interesting things on these trips
                    that we were traveling on, when we'd get to a village there wasn't a hotel. If
                    there was a hotel, it would close down by nine o'clock. Well, you weren't ready
                    for bed at that time usually, in town, and there were people that you wanted to
                    meet. There would be experts who were out building dams here, places that you
                    didn't have time to go visit. They came to town in the evening and the only
                    place you could meet was the whorehouse. Now we didn't go there for the whores.
                    In fact, I can remember, few were using the facility for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the place you had a beer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It was the place where you talked and had a beer, met your contacts, and it
                    was an information gathering location. The police chief might get a freebie, but
                    we weren't into that. I remember my boss's wife had told me when I got to post.
                    She said, “Now look. This is gonna (going to) be a part of your travel
                    experience.” She said, “ My husband does this all the time, and I don't have any
                    problem with it. It's not something he's using.”</p>
                <p>But the whole problem of the GIs (general infantry) as they were coming up,
                    airmen I guess it was, not GIs, was that many of them were coming to find this
                    as a first experience. They would come into the office and, because we didn't
                    have a consulate in Ubol, wanting to know how they could get their girlfriends,
                    who they were wanting to marry, official and back home. Well, they thought that
                    they had compromised these girls, and it was their duty to marry them. Of
                    course, the girls ran a business. When these guys left, even if they ultimately
                    did get to the States, they were carrying on their business, even though the
                    guys were sending money back for them while they were gone. Very tough girls,
                    there was nothing wrong with the trade. It was a way they could earn their
                    dowry, get themselves set up for marriage by themselves, a perfectly acceptable
                    part of society. The health facility on Fridays would have them all come in;
                    they'd be checked over. But it was certainly startling for me, certainly
                    (laughing), and certainly for the airmen who didn't have as much contact with
                    the local society. They didn't understand that this was to be treated a certain
                    way. You went to the girls at night; you didn't squire them around the town.
                    Some of them did that and it was offensive to the community.</p>
                <p>Basically it didn't matter what level of society you were in, you did not go out
                    with your wife, and you didn't go together to the restaurant. The district
                    attorney did. He was an oddball. He and his wife would go out to the restaurant
                    in public and eat. If you went to a party, the men went to one place; the women
                    went to another house. Wives didn't go to the same parties. It was just the way
                    it was done.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I remember once up in the Nakhon Panom on the river, the GIs, the airmen were
                    just coming in. They were setting up a base. I saw these fellows in winter
                    uniforms walking down the main street one night and I walked up to visit them. I
                    talked to one of them and I said, “Where are you coming from?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Michigan. They loaded us on a plane, and they passed us through Travis
                    Air Force Base in California, and here we are.” He didn't know where he was. He
                    had just been engaged and he was all worried. He says, “I'm gonna be
                    faithful.”</p>
                <p>I don't know, I never saw him again, but the odds were against him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, I was leaving Ubol Ratchathani, up in the ear of the elephant as you're
                    looking at Thailand as the shape of an elephant's head, close to the border with
                    Laos, and just north of the border of Cambodia. I left there in May of 1966 and
                    went to Bangkok for TDY (temporary duty), went back up to bring my family down.
                    We had an incident, tragic one at that point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes. My son picked up a mosquito bite and died of encephalitis the next
                    week. We stayed there in Bangkok for a couple of more months before we went on
                    our first home leave. This was a illustration of the USIA versus State, and
                    one-upmanship, and the agency said, “Well by golly, State's gonna (going) to
                    start doing the three year tours now. So we're going to jump first, we're in the
                    three year tours.” Well State never jumped, at least in that decade. But I think
                    for first two or three years out was too long. But anyway...</p>

                <p>GOOD: I came back on home leave, the only home leave I ever got that was a full
                    home leave because I was going back to the same post. I managed to miss
                    Johnson's presidential visit to Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Aw, shucks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Shucks. I did get to enjoy the benefits of that visit however, because the
                    post sneaked in some better cars and some typewriters, although they had to send
                    the typewriters back later because they hadn't gotten permission from Washington
                    to buy them. I came through the Philippines on the way back in and enjoyed the
                    paved streets that had been prepared for the Johnson visit in Manila. I came
                    back to the job I had been brought down from Ubol to take, which was field
                    support officer. We had or were in the process of expanding to 13 branch posts
                    in Thailand, and they'd wanted someone who had both executive office experience
                    and field experience. I had both, having been in the executive office for a bit
                    before I went out up country, to service, make sure the personnel was running
                    well, to make sure the supply lines were in shape, make sure that the housing
                    was fine, the offices were rented, cars were provided and the regulations were
                    adhered to. So it meant a lot of traveling, but by the time I'd finished, I had
                    been to all the provinces of Thailand, whether or not they were part of the
                    official itinerary or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this when, was it '66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: '66 to '68. It was a two-year tour. We did not completely staff all 13
                    posts in the end. We had the facilities rented. We had everything ready to go,
                    but they ultimately after I left, finally didn't get people into two of them as
                    I remember. Now of course it's way down to perhaps one; I'm not sure what the
                    latest statistic is. The basic ones when I got there were Udorn in the north,
                    which had a consulate at that time, Chiang Mai, of course, in the north with a
                    consulate, Songkhla in the south which had had a consulate, but I think by the
                    time I got there it was closed, and Korat which was the starting off point for
                    the northeast area and the location for storage of a battalion's worth of
                    military equipment, in case of its need.</p>
                <p>It was also the base for the major road construction project through northeast to
                    the Laos border, which it had been completed shortly before I arrived in '63. It
                    was a contract operation. They brought Chinese in, to work on it. It was a
                    paved, all weather, two lane road, which was a marvelous addition to the
                    northeast. It was the only length of paved road that they had in the northeast.
                    Now I understand that all the provincial capitals are connected, and the
                    laterite roads have disappeared on the main stretches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With these posts, what was the rationale for having so
                        many ithis country? What were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>GOOD: Washington began to back away from this about this time, although of course
                    inertia kept things going for a while. Vietnam had started effectively in
                    abou'64, '65. We were looking for dependable allies in the region. We were going
                    to do everything we could to make sure that Thailand was one of those. We were
                    constantly out while I was up in Ubol and of course after I left Ubol,
                    supporting the branch posts, taking teams, and sponsoring teams of Thai
                    government officials from the district level with specialist doctors,
                    agricultural officers, and so forth. The purpose was to show the people that the
                    King was thinking of them and taking care of them and interested in listening to
                    what they had to say, on the theory that if the people were supportive of the
                    King, that he would be the binding force, the focal point for all attention, and
                    there wouldn't be any susceptibility to the communist influence which was coming
                    in on the Laotian and Cambodian sides from Vietnam. That was the theory. We
                    pinned up a lot of pictures of the King, which were printed in our Manila
                    printing plant, we distributed lots of propaganda in the form of comic books,
                    some of this was on health, and some of it was on security, we had molam, which
                    were groups of singers who sort of chanted. It wasn't just a song, but chanted
                    stories which had propaganda themes of the good guy wins, the good guy is a good
                    guy because for example he brought health facilities to them, and just generally
                    tried to bring the country together. Washington thought we were spending too
                    much money on something that wasn't direct enough for their feelings. However,
                    our PAO was very senior and he held the area director at bay while he was still
                    there. The shouting matches on the telephone could be heard through the entire
                    building however..</p>
                <p>Well this is the usual thing. Washington, wanting something much more direct or
                    policy oriented, “You fight communists,” that sort of thing. We were trying to
                    say, “Well, that's not the way to do it. You say, 'You support the king.'"</p>
                <p>Well, obviously, there had been agreement initially in Washington about how to do
                    this, but then a new area director arrived who ultimately bombed out of the
                    agency because he became in India somewhat like a MacArthur. He didn't listen.
                    It was his first area director job and he was looking to make a mark. Of course
                    you make marks in two ways, you cut back or you expand. He took the cutback
                    route in the case of Thailand.</p>
                <p>Q: As you were looking over this whole thing, as you're looking at the map, were
                    there areas in Thailand where you felt that we needed to concentrate more or
                    that were more dubious as far as supporting their cause?</p>
                <p>GOOD: You mean who might be approaching the borders?</p>

                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>GOOD: There were three areas, one of which, well, four I suppose, although for
                    different reasons, of which two were not communistic in their threats. The
                    border with Malaysia, the Malaysian uprising or revolution or submersion,
                    was...</p>
                <p>Q: Insurgency.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Insurgency they called it, yes. It was really finished by '63, but that
                    didn't mean that there wasn't concern that it might start up again on the Thai
                    side and then work its way south. There was some concern down there, and as a
                    result, we opened up another post in Yala, which was closer to the border of
                    Malaysia on the east side.</p>
                <p>The border with Burma was not of the concern it is today, although across from
                    Victoria there was a little bit of concern, because you had water communication,
                    communication between the Thai port and the Burmese port.</p>
                <p>The two areas of real concern were up in the Chiang Rai area bordering with Laos
                    and fairly close to China and, of course, in the northeast, bordering with Laos
                    along the Mekong, where we were fairly close to the Ho Chi Minh Trail, almost
                    shooting distance at points. So close, that by the time I got up to Ubol in '64,
                    you no longer could take the river side road that ran from Pakse up to
                    Vientiane. It wasn't secure. Any communications were being done by plane at that
                    point. Air America was acting up then.</p>
                <p>It was still safe enough in the south of Laos because the trail moved closer to
                    Vietnam at that point and Laos became wider. So we were still able to go up into
                    the hills across the Mekong, where the climate was a little bit milder. The
                    Philippines had a missionary, a Tom Dooley mission up there, medical
                    mission.</p>
                <p>I was just reading the other day, a story of an American who's currently teaching
                    English somewhere in Thailand and he talks about a stay he made in Ubol. There
                    was a town, Phibun; it was about 15, 20 miles to the east, on the way to the
                    border of Laos. He talks about it as being a major center these days. It was on
                    an interesting rapids, white water area, on the river. When I was there, it was
                    not unknown as a tourist attraction, but it wasn't connected by a paved road. It
                    wasn't really geared up for tourists. The way he talks about this, it's the
                    biggest thing since sliced bread in northeast Thailand. (Laughing) It was
                    interesting to see how it had changed. It was a vacation spot for prostitutes
                    for example, who would take a two-week shift in a house in Phibun in order to be
                    able to enjoy some neighborhood entertainments during the day, and then go back
                    to wherever they were based. But aside from prostitutes, and an occasional
                    family I guess going down to enjoy, a local family, not coming from any
                    distance, it was not a major tourist attraction.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>But during these two years that I was in the field support job, I, as I said, had
                    a great deal of travel to do. It was easier travel than when I'd been at post
                    because I was going between provincial capitals, mostly traveling by train, but
                    on occasion delivering vehicles. We took a caravan out of there once, dropped
                    cars off as we went south on the Kra Peninsula. Occasionally driving north, I
                    remember taking a truck trip with a buddy who was based in Bangkok also. We
                    climbed on a bus truck if you will. It was really not an official bus. It took
                    merchandise between points which had no roads, because all roads led south
                    toward Bangkok. They didn't go east and west. Of course it was useful to have
                    some to step cross east to west, because there were things in between. It's just
                    they weren't important. So they had some trucks. They didn't have real roads.
                    They were paths and fording rivers, but then you did that most everywhere you
                    went.</p>
                <p>But it was interesting, like the time I climbed on the logging train coming from
                    the River Kwai. The River Kwai (Kway) as they said in the movie, where there had
                    been a camp, or near where there had been a POW camp during World War II for
                    building the railroad for the Japanese across to Burma. Of course, that was long
                    gone, but there was a train running up to the town at that point. So John and I
                    climbed on this train and rode it back toward Bangkok, picked up our car at the
                    other end. We were young.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. While you were doing this whole program, did you
                        finyourself up against any cultural restrictions or caveats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, these cultural nuances, I learned about them a little bit late, I
                    think. I was already up country; nobody had given me an orientation. After we
                    had been in a village one day, I was told by my chief local employee that I
                    should not precede the district office when we went to a headman's house in a
                    village to have a chat in the evenings because I was the visitor, and he was the
                    official. It hit me hard. I can remember as if it were right here in this room.
                    He was right of course. I was definitely wrong. I understand what proconsul
                    means having been in Thailand. We were under red passports, not black in those
                    days, but it didn't make any difference. If you were American, anything you
                    wanted was yours. Nobody would tell you no. It was up to you to be sensitive.
                    Unfortunately, there were so many Americans that a lot of people weren't
                    sensitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>GOOD: But there was no real effort on the part of the Thais to do anything about
                    this. They were going to roll with the punch. They rolled with the Japanese
                    punch in World War II and survived. They had managed to keep their independence
                    during the British and French carving of territory early in the matter and they
                    knew that they would be able to last through the American invasion as well. And,
                    of course, they were making money hand over fist. We were dumping money in that
                    country, not just official grant funds or donations, equipment and so on, but
                    just per diem. We had 10,000 GIs a week in there for R &amp; R, in Bangkok.
                    That's a lot of money!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an awful lot of money!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: And if you couldn't get your investment back in two years froa hotel that
                    you'd built, something was wrong with your business deal.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Did you run across the problem of grasping entrepreneurs that you were
                    using for one purpose of building things or something, of trying to make sure
                    that things were done correctly?</p>
                <p>GOOD: USIS didn't, because we weren't handling contracts as such. The military
                    did. They occasionally would run into the need to pay somebody off, usually a
                    military officer or general, in order to get a project moving. There would be
                    all kinds of bureaucratic barriers being set up, which could easily be brushed
                    aside by a high enough official, but he needed to be convinced with a little bit
                    of money. Yes, that happened.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. How about films and things like that? Did you have a pretty good
                    repertoire to draw on, and how did they sort of fit within the Thai?</p>
                <p>GOOD: We'd made our own films in some cases. Certainly the molam groups were on
                    film. The villages liked the molam groups better than, of course, anything that
                    we could import from outside, even if it'd been dubbed into Thai because they
                    knew the molam. They were comfortable with the dialect. It was their speech, and
                    they were comfortable with the means. If we'd pull out this as we usually did
                    just to draw a crowd at the start of an evening, New York film, it had color,
                    didn't have anything but musical background, showed you the majestic towers in
                    New York, that was fine for a teaser, but it wouldn't have kept them, because it
                    was too far away from their comprehension. They hadn't seen it, weren't about to
                    be able to see it, so why bother with it. It was a five minutes, ten minutes
                    max, and then you'd have to get on to something that would hold their
                    attention.</p>
                <p>The cities of course were showing the Western films, the 007. It'not 007 at that
                    point; it was...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, spaghetti Westerns with Clint Eastwood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: With Clint Eastwood were started then. Of course the Thai theaters always
                    made these gigantic signs, which might be 20 feet long and 15 feet high that
                    were freestanding in the front of their buildings, in the front of their
                    theaters so that people could see it from a distance. They weren't subtle. To a
                    certain extent, they were caricatures, but they showed you the people and showed
                    you their reactions, and there were girls and that pulled people in. Of course,
                    you stood up when you got in there because the national anthem was playing. You
                    know, after that was done, you could sit down. The movie would start and away
                    you'd go. But we didn't have any censorship, of course. We did later in
                    Australia. It surprised me. Australia still has censorship of anything that's
                    coming in from outside, particularly TV series, TV shows. But Thailand didn't
                    have any of that, self-censorship I suppose. Of course, we didn't put the
                    violence and the sex in anything we did.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, yes. Were you getting a feel about how the war in Vietnam was being
                    played, because this is during that, as we started our big buildup, and you
                    there when the Tet Offensive caught us by surprise?</p>
                <p>GOOD: We were building in Thailand of course. We were bringing in thousands of
                    troops. At our level in the field, it was concern as the how day-to-day
                    operations were affecting our guys who were based in Thailand, the rescue
                    troops, helicopters, and F-4s who were going out to protect. We didn't get
                    involved with the policy. We were down at the grass level and we were interested
                    in the behavior in the troops and community relations. One of our jobs was
                    community relations liaison between the U.S. base commander and the city
                    officials. But policy wasn't a particular interest. You could pick up these
                    things on the radios, but we didn't have the press in the field. The press was
                    limited to places like Bangkok; Chiang Mai might have had a few rags around.
                    They didn't want anything more than local news in the agoras. We were not
                    preaching a direct message, so we weren't particularly concerned. Our libraries,
                    of course, had books about the United States. We were pushing the United States
                    as a friendly ally, but we weren't trying to get in there and sell them on
                    Vietnam, or our policy, not at the field level.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Q: Acting as liaison officer, I would imagine your people would have gotten quite
                    involved with getting our military base commanders to deal with the problems.
                    You had a lot of young men, and all these pretty girls out there! There must
                    have been a lot of problems?</p>
                <p>GOOD: There were problems, although they really didn't get out of hand. If they
                    had a problem, well, for example, as I said, my house was half block from the
                    governor's. There were 19 houses within a block of us, in a circle. Our area was
                    off limits to the troops. There were other areas that they could go to. The
                    people we had a little bit of trouble with were the listeners, not the air
                    troops.The big guys who were the fitness types, the CIA side because they were
                    brighter, in general. They were off base, they had their own house, and it was a
                    little more difficult to keep them under control. Their commander would come up
                    occasionally and try to thin the girls out of the houses, they weren't supposed
                    to have them in there.</p>
                <p>As far as riots or misbehavior of that sort, I don't remember any of it, anywhere
                    in my area, and you had a lot of troops, particularly in the Nakhon Phenom,
                    where you were only about 17 clicks (kilometers) from the base. It was a major
                    base, because it was the main rescue place for North Vietnam activities.
                    Initially before they had the facilities really built up out there, they had a
                    lot of these troops in town. As I said, this guy walking up and down one night
                    was the precursor, but hundreds and thousands more came. Once they got their
                    facilities, they had the go-cart racing out there, they had the bowling, and
                    whatever, and then they kept the men restricted to the base, unless they had
                    some business in town.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Martin, Graham Martin.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, we had a branch officers' meeting in Bangkok. We did get addressed by
                    him. The only advice I can remember him giving us directly was, “If you're gonna
                    have an affair, make sure it's outside of Thailand. I don't restrict you on
                    affairs, but don't do it on home territory.” That's all.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought would have been all very nice, but it's some of the most
                    beautiful women in the world (laughing), and they're all over the place.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>GOOD: And they were all over the place, of course and there was no local societal
                    restriction to it at all, provided of course you did it appropriately. You
                    didn't squire them around town. The problems of disease were a minor problem at
                    that time, syphilis I suppose, gonorrhea certainly. They did have a public
                    health operation going, at least in the provinces. I'm not sure about Bangkok.
                    The girls were to be checking in to the health office every week, Friday
                    morning, but it wasn't a major problem. Peace Corps had some problems with this,
                    I remember. They had a very high infection rate, at least as reported at Seventh
                    Day Adventist Hospital. But the problems that you have today with AIDS (acquired
                    immunodeficiency syndrome), well that's a different world.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, a different world. How did you find, I mean looking at it, you were in
                    Bangkok. How did you find the USIA operation meshed with the consulate's
                    men?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well in the field, we got along very well with the consulates. We were in
                    areas that were in their territory, but which they didn't have manned. So we
                    were a resource that they could tap. There wasn't extensive use of us because
                    there wasn't that much business. But we were there, and they knew that we could
                    be tapped if needed.</p>
                <p>In Bangkok, we really had nothing to do with the consulates, except in so far as
                    we were dealing from the cultural office with the exchanges, the training
                    programs. We had occasionally difficulty with the ADM (administrative) section.
                    (Laughing)</p>
                <p>In fact, one of the reasons that I left for law school was my irritation with the
                    presumption on the part of some of these lowly ADM types over there that no one
                    else could read the negotiations. The senior ADM officer was great. I wish I
                    could remember his name, but he and his wife were the most dapper couple that
                    I've ever seen in the Foreign Service. They could come through a day of driving
                    in the heat of the countryside and appear without a wrinkle or a hair out of
                    place. They were magnificent that way. But some of their underlings tended to
                    presume they knew more about the regs (regulations) than we did. I found that to
                    be ridiculous. And of course, after I'd finished law school I concluded that I
                    now knew it was ridiculous. I didn't know any more about regs when I finished
                    law school than I did before, but now they paid attention to me, because they
                    figured that I probably did. So there was some visceral satisfaction in spending
                    three years at law just to come back and being able to tell a state ADM officer
                    to stuff it!</p>
                <p>Q: When you left Thailand in '68, had the Tet Offensive of January, February,
                    left much of a mark? We're talking about Tet Offensive in Saigon, well, all of
                    Vietnam. Had that had an impact in Thailand?</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>GOOD: No, I don't remember it having any impact. There were military Thais over
                    in Vietnam, of course, a small group. One of our employees who was our tech
                    manager, a Cal Tech engineer. He knew his stuff. His background was Chinese
                    Spanish, but he was Thai. He got himself declared officially dead in Thon Buri,
                    across the river from Bangkok, so that he wouldn't be called up to go to Vietnam
                    with the Thai usurp. (Laughing)</p>
                <p>Q: Well, from my listening to this, a year later, from the time you left, I was
                    at Saigon. Thai troops, the main problem was they might drop a box in the PX
                    (post exchange) on their toe.</p>
                <p>GOOD: (laughing) They didn't send their best. They did it becauswe wanted
                    someone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was more flags, I think, this was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, they wanted to have some representations so they could say this was
                    the United Nations effort. But back home it didn't have any. I don't remember
                    any deaths; we didn't have any reported. It was a sideshow.</p>
                <p>The big story, of course, was the money being made out of these GIs coming over
                    from Vietnam every week. Now the GI's didn't have to go to Bangkok. Some of them
                    with any brains went down to Panang. You'd see a few down there.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, I ran the consular section for 18 months in Saigon. They would go to
                    Australia and to Hong Kong. We would give out passports, and you know, so they
                    went to Hawaii.</p>
                <p>GOOD: A minority.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, most, yes. Well in '68, it must have been difficult, particularly for you
                    and your wife after losing a child. Had you given thought to not coming back to
                    Thailand or not?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, we were young officers. We didn't have any choice, and as a result of
                    it, it didn't cross our minds. We rolled with the punch. We went home, had our
                    home leave. Maybe that's why they let us take the whole home leave, I don't
                    know; 42 days we were out. We came back with a new car and put the oldest at
                    that point in school, at the American school, and away we went.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I was traveling so much that I wasn't all that much involved with the local
                    scene. My wife had friends and they did their things, and we had the occasional
                    party of course. But I wasn't really that much a part of the Bangkok scene
                    myself.</p>

                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, I had put in for another year of grad school. They decided in their
                    wisdom not to do that, not to grant that request. The sticking point as I
                    learned years later was that they didn't want to pay medical expenses while I
                    was off at school on leave. Of course, it was not something that I needed
                    because when you're at the University of California, they pay it as part of your
                    coverage. So I had to resign. Five of us did resign from USIS that year, not
                    because we were particularly unhappy with USIS, but we had other things we
                    wanted to do. A couple of us went back to school. Another fellow had another job
                    he wanted to go to in fact. So I left in August of '68 and went back and picked
                    up my family. My family had left earlier; we'd separated for most of that last
                    year. They were in Phoenix. So I picked them up there, and we went to Berkeley,
                    got married housing, which was three tiny bedrooms, a living room, and a side
                    kitchen, which for $45 or $55 a month, including utilities was quite reasonable.
                    They had bus service to the campus from the married housing area in Albany, and
                    I started school.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were taking what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why law?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I didn't want to do any more Ph.D. work. I had done a year of that, and
                    after having watched the Ph. D's particularly overseas, some of the AID people,
                    I didn't want to be so narrow minded, so narrowly focused. I don't mean to be
                    dismissive, but I didn't like a lot of restrictions on my education. So I
                    decided in '67 that if I were going to resign. I wanted to go to law school. I
                    had thought about it six years before, and had not done it for reasons I guess,
                    of money as much as anything else.</p>
                <p>I took the LSAT and my score, plus my grades from grad school, plus the fact that
                    I had been in the Foreign Service, I guess got me into Berkeley. My LSAT score
                    was one point above the average for the class, so I guess I was competitive. I
                    wanted to go to Berkeley because I wanted to be sure that I was competitive at
                    the upper levels of our education system in the States. I had not gone to a
                    first rate school up to that point. I was happy to find that I did graduate a
                    little above the middle of my class. I didn't have the ambitious feelings that
                    some of my classmates did. They were really going into law. By the time I'd
                    gotten into the second year, I was aware that I was still so hooked by the
                    Foreign Service that I wanted to go back overseas. So I was going to stay and
                    take the Bar and then come back in. I was brought back on board on leave without
                    pay in the beginning of my third year.</p>

                <p>GOOD: You had to have heard something about it at that time?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I yes, I mean in your own way you already had the free speech movement
                    going earlier, but it was really rumbling. Can you give your conceptions?</p>
                <p>GOOD: It was, it was wild! A lot of my classmates were involved in it. Not the
                    married housing area. That was off away from campus and quiet. But there was
                    involvement in student politics on the part of a number of law students. The
                    student body president every year I was there was a law student. They were in
                    court my second and third year a lot of the time on manslaughter charges, murder
                    charges, because of events that happened during campus activities,
                    rabble-rousing teachers, and so forth. We had the People's Park March. We had
                    the anti-Cambodian invasion period. It was a very active political time. That
                    had been started before I got there in '68 of course, and that was one of the
                    reasons I chose Berkeley over Stanford.</p>
                <p>Stanford was dull. I visited when I was in the States in fall of '97 looking at
                    schools and I was not impressed with Stanford. If I'd wanted to go to a park, if
                    I just wanted to go to a rest home, that was Stanford. Now Stanford picked up
                    after '71, where Berkeley slid back into more stable activities.</p>
                <p>But the whole three years I was there, it was very, very active.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Only briefly, I was a bit upset with the Cambodian invasion.That would have
                    been my second year I think.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Yes, spring of '70. Yes, that was the only time though that I felt that I
                    was. Course I was restricted from then on in '70 to '71 by the return to USIS
                    rolls.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Q: Were the students that you were seeing, was going to Berkeley, so often a
                    state university, you go to the state university as opposed to going off to
                    Harvard or Yale or Chicago in law, in order to get the contacts and in order so
                    you can enter California politics.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Now that's an Eastern point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The Western point of view is not that. Berkeley is the premier school for
                    the West Coast. So if you wanted to be a part of the political scene in the San
                    Francisco area certainly, if not more, Berkeley was the place to have gone to
                    law school. Berkeley, of course, is better situated. It's one of the top ten by
                    anybody's count. They didn't lose their professors to Harvard. They might go
                    back for a sabbatical year, but after they had a year of Boston, they came back
                    (laughing) happily to San Francisco. So we didn't feel that we were getting
                    second choice people. There, of course, were people, if you were rich and you
                    wanted to go some place on the West Coast, you'd go to Stanford, I suppose.
                    There were, of course, the people who did think of Smith. Most of us out West
                    didn't register at Smith or Wellesley or any Ivy League school.</p>
                <p>I'd found that particularly true when I arrived in '63. We had a professor from
                    Seton Hall; he had been there at least. He was all excited about the canals in
                    the east. We had no system of canals in the West. Well are there ditches of any
                    importance to us? And of course I still feel a great deal that way. I'm anxious
                    to get back to the West Coast, I'll admit that, because there's a history here
                    that we don't have in the West, and there's a focus behind, that we don't have
                    as our perspective in the West. So most of my class stayed in the West. I think,
                    I know that there are about three of them now in this area working for the
                    federal government. One was States Legal Counsel. But they didn't come
                    immediately. Nobody in my class interviewed seriously with the federal
                    government that year because they were so down on Nixon. So I was not a black
                    sheep because I had been in the government. I was older, and so they didn't hold
                    it against me, but they just weren't interested.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I thought they did a fine job. There were some problems over in San
                    Francisco State. The President got up on a vehicle one day and started
                    haranguing the crowd, but he was more upset about having any other language than
                    English in use as about something political like the war. Yes, there were people
                    upset with the Board of Regents. There was some concern on the part of the law
                    school about the subsidies, the money for books, money for subscriptions for
                    magazines, that sort of thing. The law school was doing a pretty good job of
                    pulling money in directly dedicated to the law school, so they weren't hurting
                    that much. Reagan almost then, was already a Teflon man. It didn't stick to him.
                    People would get upset with him occasionally.</p>
                <p>But really, more of a concern was coming out of the state college system, not the
                    university system. The university system had much more interest in the grad
                    schools. I think it's fair to say that there were more serious-minded students
                    there. You didn't hear about anything going on in Caltech (California Institute
                    of Technology) for example, either. But at San Francisco State and other of the
                    state schools, state college network, you did have more active people because
                    the undergraduate level was a more powerful faction. At Berkeley with 28,000
                    students you probably had 300 activists who could draw a crowd of a couple
                    thousand maybe. But most people avoided it.</p>
                <p>We had problems up at the law school because we were downwind form the student
                    union. The wind was blowing toward us and we had this tear gas blowing up our
                    way, so we'd occasionally have to scurry east, north, or south to get away from
                    that before we could get home. (Laughing) It didn't very often get inside of the
                    classroom. Well, you could smell it in the library, but that was it.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>GOOD: You don't in the J.D. program. Seriously, you don't. You may take in your
                    second and third year some electives that point a direction that others might
                    not be going. First year is solid, you had no choice. Second year is pretty
                    solid, and you have little choice. But I was able to take some international law
                    courses and a Roman law course that was a lot of fun. But you start with things
                    like tax and corporate law. Third year you had a chance to get out into the
                    courts and to take independent study programs of a sort. It's not until you
                    finish law school that you then focus on a specialty. You can go back and get a
                    Master's degree in international law, taxation, or any number of other fields.
                    Environmental law was beginning to become special at that time, but it wasn't
                    yet. Gender was not yet an issue. I had not thought about going back for a
                    Master's, because I'd been in the Foreign Service all this time. I did go back
                    two years ago to do a year of immigration law to get myself tooled up. Congress
                    had messed so completely in immigration law since I'd gone out to the field in
                    '90 that I had to get back in the classroom. So if anything, I'm a specialist in
                    immigration law, but I don't have a Master's degree in it.</p>

                    career management at the agency, and he brought me back in. I came back in as an

                    again. We were in FSI at that time. I did that just before I went to Chile after
                    the end of my Spanish language training in fall of '71. Rob Nevitt, I don't know
                    if you know him or not, he wanted me to come back in the summer of '71 to take a
                    job in Rio. I wanted to lock in my law degree, so I stayed to take the Bar and,
                    as a result, didn't take the Brazil job. I ended up in Chile. But I definitely
                    wanted South America and he was able to accommodate me.</p>

                <p>GOOD: I hadn't lost my interest in South America. I guess the feeling that Latin
                    America was close to home and it was an exciting area. I had always had a fear
                    of the enormity of the cultural knowledge needed for the Far East. I had not
                    been interested in specializing there. Thailand was an assignment. I was
                    interested in staying out of Asia.</p>
                <p>Europe didn't attract me as a place. If I'd wanted to go to Europe,I'd have gone
                    as a business man.</p>
                <p>I wanted to go someplace that didn't have an academic mountain to climb, but
                    which was closer in cultural terms to the States, or was definitely so exotic
                    that it didn't matter. That's Africa. So I've spent more time in Latin America
                    and Africa than the rest of the overseas assignments combined.</p>
                <p>I've had some fun tours. I made friends in places I had no interesin going back
                    to, of course, but that's later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you were in Chile from '71 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Actually '72, beginning in February, because I did languagfrom September to
                    January.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Chile from '72 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: March of '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah huh, interesting time!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, not quite as wild as Vietnam, but as things go, both are certainly in
                    the upper levels. Chile taught me about economy. When I arrived, the exchange
                    rate was 68 to 1, and the unofficial was about 80. In September of '73, the
                    exchange rate was 3,000 to 1 unofficially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>GOOD: The official rate was about 120; that's only an academic number because we
                    didn't use the official rate, except in accommodation exchange for our cultural
                    programs, which allowed us the advantage of being able to bring in first class
                    groups. The Modern Jazz Quartet for example, paying their European level of
                    stipend, and charge the people coming in through the door, at a nickel a night.
                    We took the receipts and converted them at the embassy at the official rate of
                    exchange. That gave us enough dollars to pay the high rates. The embassy was
                    forced to use the official rate of course, but there was a quirk in the law that
                    did not make it illegal for us to use the unofficial rate, unlike in Nigeria
                    later.</p>
                <p>There was usually, as far as I know, somebody in every office who handled the
                    informal exchange. I took it over when our exec officer position was dropped.
                    I'd receive a cardboard box, two feet by two feet, full of money from my
                    contact, and I would then write a check or accumulate a series of checks to be
                    sent to the Manufacturer's Hanover Bank in New York to his account. It was very
                    politically interesting because until the coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coup was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The coup was in September of '73. They had an attempt in July of '73, which
                    didn't quite make it. I got caught on that one. I was up in the Atacama Desert
                    on vacation. The Atacama Desert is up at about 5,000 feet, most of it. We were
                    coming back down the slope, headed south toward Santiago when my fuel injector
                    system collapsed. So I just coasted about 10 miles to the bottom of the hill.
                    There was a gas station. I left the car there, and it got stuck because there
                    wasn't any traffic moving during this coup attempt. This is what they call the
                    “Tancazo.” It took me till after coup, from July 5 till the end of September to
                    get that car to Santiago so that I could get an analysis of what I needed to put
                    the order in to the States, the order then got caught up in the Christmas rush,
                    and I didn't get the car fixed until February.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Chile when you arrived in
                        '72?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Quiet, it was summer, reverse seasons, nothing was happening. It was hot,
                    it was dry, schools were out, and I had no pressure against my moving into my
                    job slowly. We were in temporary housing, looking for a house. We got the house,
                    and then on March things started picking up. Then it got very busy because we
                    had the exchange rate bonus. It was an open time. There were no restrictions on
                    what we could bring in. We were pushing the American flag, if you will. We were
                    doing it one way; CIA was doing it another way. We were helping them actually in
                    some ways. We were working with radio stations and bringing in some parts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now Allende was in power?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>GOOD: Allende was already in. He came in, I believe, in '71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the embassy, from your fellow
                        officerabout Allende at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well in my section, which was the cultural section, we weren't getting any
                    particularly special offers. The PAO was trying to take over the political
                    officer's job. He'd come down with a policy chip on his shoulder to prove that
                    USIS could really weigh in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Jim Halsema, God rest his soul. So there was tension between the political
                    and the information section. Jeff Davidow who was there as the number two of the
                    political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He's our ambassador to Mexico now. First rate, I mean you don't get any
                    better than Jeff Davidow. We had no difficulties at the second level. It was
                    just the heads of sections that were bucking each other. We got along well with
                    the ADM (Administrative) section. In fact, we got along well with the embassy,
                    because we were all in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time? Nat Davis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Nat Davis was there, yes and the defense attach� was also Davis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, I mean, was there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He didn't run the embassy. He was smart. He rode on top doing policy and
                    liaison reports, and he let his DCM, who later became Assistant Secretary of
                    State for Latin America, who was a real pro, running the embassy. He was
                    superb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting this and saying, “Boy, this guy Allende
                        ireally bad news,” or not? Or was it just another guy they mentioned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, in a way it was amusing. The emotional level was high obviously with
                    the local employees because they were taking sides. I thought it rather amusing
                    having just come from California, because some of the policies, take the
                    educational policy for example that Allende was pushing, centralized curriculum
                    control, was more conservative than what we had in California. So here was a
                    communist theme, if you will, which was more conservative than what I was
                    accustomed to in California, and yet the Christian Democrats were very upset
                    with. They thought that it was too wild. The American point of view in many
                    cases was far more radical than whatever was going on on either side in
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>Now the foreign ramifications, the involvements of the Cubans, the involvement of
                    the Russians, or whatever were not minor. But then they weren't really serious
                    either. All you had to do was look at the map and you could see that the supply
                    line was a little bit too long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes (laughing).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: For them to seriously be involved if anybody wanted to disrupit.</p>
                <p>From our point of view, Chile, while it made some headlines and was a nuisance,
                    was not a threat. It was isolated, it was far away even for us, and it was not
                    in any position really to infiltrate the neighboring countries with their
                    particular point of view.</p>
                <p>Now the Chileans looked upon themselves as the Australians do at some points, as
                    being the center of the world, because they are so isolated that they don't have
                    any real contact with what other people are thinking. So from their point of
                    view, whatever happened in Santiago must be making the headlines all over the
                    world, because nothing else infringed upon their consciousness. You had the
                    ocean, you had the mountains, you had the Antarctic, and you had the desert, and
                    that was it.</p>
                <p>So they were amusing in some ways, serious in others, because of course the
                    secret police were involved, and there were people disappearing, and there was
                    the invasion of the properties, which of course cut into the food supply. The
                    landowners had no interest in '72 to plant a crop, because it was liable to be
                    taken over by these uncontrolled younger elements of the communist parliament.
                    Allende didn't have control of all of his supporters, and thus things got out of
                    hand. He could not control them, but what they were doing, was pushing him in a
                    direction of decision making that was going to cause him problems, which it
                    ultimately did.</p>
                <p>Q: Local employees too, I mean, there must have been. I would think that
                    everybody who was sort of intellectually involved would have been picking sides
                    at this point.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, and of course those that were working for us were not in favor of
                    Allende. In fact one of our top information assistant later on went over to be
                    the press officer for Pinochet.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>The real problem on the minds of everybody, which I don't know whether it shows
                    up in the research much or not, but living there, the problem was economic.
                    People did not have enough money, because of the inflation, to buy what they
                    needed, and there wasn't that much available to buy anyway. Meat was very hard
                    to come by, because early on, even before I got there, the cattle barons had
                    shipped their cattle across the border, run it across the border to Argentina,
                    knowing that it was liable to be confiscated later. We brought meat in from
                    Argentina at the embassy for the commissary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just trying to say, I mean, I couldn't think of any
                        arewhere there should be less of a problem of meat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, but of course, the producers couldn't get a price that made it
                    economically viable to continue production. Wine, there's a lot of wine in
                    Chile, very difficult to get a hold of. We could get it. We brought our bottles
                    to be filled because we were diplomats. They gave us preference, we and the
                    military. Gasoline, very hard to come by, so people were unable to run their
                    cars. You could get some fish products and a lot of those. Well you'd get some
                    chicken, but the chicken tasted like fish too, because fishmeal -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fishmeal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Fishmeal is what they were feeding the chicken. What you could get from our
                    point of view was cheap, because we had money coming out of our ears! I felt I
                    was living on a $100,000 salary because of the inflation rate. A five-course
                    meal with wine was 75 cents, so I ate very few meals at home. I had breakfast at
                    home. Lunch and dinner, almost always outside, and this was with a full time
                    live in maid in the house that cost me $15 a month. So a night out for four
                    people was 15 bucks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, where-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I should say there were a few of them, Stu, who had some political
                    concerns. They had college age or early 20s kids who were involved, usually
                    opposed to Allende, in the case of the ones I knew, although there were some
                    that were on the other side. I know one that committed suicide after the coup,
                    after the revolution because he was so disappointed, and he was fearful that
                    they'd go after him, too.</p>
                <p>But economics wasn't something that was a worry at the embassy itself, or with
                    our adult contacts. At the universities of course, you'd have theoretical
                    discussions and some arguments, but I wasn't dealing with the universities. I
                    was dealing with cultural presentations.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Q: Here you were translating American policy to almost visceral - I know hatred
                    is the right term, but - dislike or something of Nixon and Kissinger towards
                    Allende. He really was pushing. There was real concern there that Allende was
                    the...</p>
                <p>GOOD: That was what you'd read about now. That was to the extent that it existed,
                    it was at a level far above our heads. Locally, we didn't as Americans feel any
                    resentment. On occasion, I can think of one instance in which somebody said
                    something, but generally speaking, we're just like they are. In fact that's the
                    one country that I've been able to blend. If I had my beard, and I had my local
                    tailored clothes, and my local haircut, and I kept my mouth shut and stood
                    still, they might have thought I was a Chilean. I've never been able to do that
                    anywhere else in the world.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that when the embassy, I mean one of the charges often laid
                    against the embassy, this is other revolutionary countries in revolutionary
                    times, is that the embassy gets pretty well in the hands, for social contacts
                    and all of the sort of wealthier people and all, and begins to take their side
                    as opposed to somebody coming from the left and stirring things up and all.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, Chile was a mix. First of all, it's not a normal South American
                    country anyway. It has one of the best distributions of wealth that you have in
                    the continent. Secondly, a lot of the leftists, communists if you will, came
                    from the top families, so you couldn't just say that the wealthy were opposed to
                    him and the poor were for him. First of all, the middle class was the most
                    important element anyway. You had some of the wealthy people on his side. Now
                    they probably, in the main, were black sheep from their families.</p>
                <p>We were interested in maintaining an opposition voice, so we were supportive in
                    the newspapers, the main newspaper were opposed to Allende. We were making sure
                    there were opposition radio stations on the air. We were supplying parts. But we
                    were not instigating the revolution against Allende, which we did get blamed for
                    later. I didn't sense any of that. We probably, at least in the part of the DIA
                    (Defense Intelligence Agency) and the CIA had a pretty good idea of what was
                    going on, but we were not in there with the planners. We were getting the
                    information perhaps a little bit late actually. We did know, as I know for a
                    fact, that there was going to be a coup a week before it took place, because I
                    was with some of the CIA guys up at a resort, and they were called back. But
                    they were not there pushing to have it happen.</p>
                <p>We did not want a martyr, which is what we got. I'm convinced that he did kill
                    himself. I was across the street. There was no reason. We certainly weren't
                    involved. We were cowering in the middle of the embassy. There weren't other
                    people around that I could tell. The planes came in as scheduled at 11 o'clock
                    and they bombed La Moneda, which is where his office was. They did such a good
                    job that of course they blamed us. “It had to be American pilots, it was so
                    pinpointed.” But they had very good pilots, American trained.</p>

                <p>Now it's true that we were supporting the military as the British were supporting
                    the navy, and the Germans were supporting the army, and that's where their links
                    had been. But we weren't there as part of the cabal, or part of the
                    conspirators. They knew that they could count on us for some support. They were
                    keeping us more or less informed, but they were probably getting more support
                    out of Brazil than they were out of us, at least those in Brazil who were
                    wanting to get rid of this suave guy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, there had been some of that before he got there. That was an economic
                    thing. That had nothing to do with politics. They were just sheerly frustrated
                    because they didn't have any bread.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, but they weren't doing it because of politics. They weren't pounding;
                    of course there were some that were doing it. The people who were out there
                    making the noise were basically unhappy because they didn't have what they
                    wanted. They were mad at Allende at that point because he was in charge, and,
                    “if we didn't have it, must be his fault.” So sure, some of them wanted to get
                    rid of him.</p>
                <p>The interesting time in Chile was after the coup for us. That's when it began to
                    impact on us with the 24-hour curfew to start with, and then it backed off to
                    six to six curfew or six to seven curfew. It cut in seriously into our
                    programming. We just couldn't do any evening activities, of course, for several
                    months. The curfew eventually moved to 10 an11, and finally to 12. But people
                    were scrambling in those evening hours too, to get things done, because the
                    nights were gone. They were having to try to correct this terrible economic
                    problem, which didn't stop obviously with the coup. It didn't resolve itself
                    until several years later after Pinochet had gone with the Chicago boys, and it
                    worked.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Mostly I was doing the cultural presentation program for the embassy, the
                    book program, working with the Bi-National Centers. I didn't do the cultural
                    exchange. We had another officer to do that, and I didn't do the student
                    relations. We had a special officer in the cultural section to deal with them.
                    That got into some politics!</p>

                    at the Embassy, but he was getting information of course. But that was because
                    the PAO was trying to develop a political agenda and show himself as a political
                    officer. He didn't really like what he was doing with these students. He enjoyed
                    his students, but he didn't like to be caught in this battle at the embassy. He
                    resigned at the end of the tour and went back to the Chicago Foreign Relations
                    Counsel.</p>

                <p>GOOD: He was more the socialist, and they were the communists.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, but I would have thought that, you know, running a normal cultural
                    presentation program, it's not without political contact, otherwise you wouldn't
                    be doing it. I would have thought this would have run afoul of the agenda of
                    those who were supporting Allende.</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, because they liked it too. It was music, or it was dance. Some of the
                    dance they didn't like, not because of any political content, because it was too
                    “avant-garde” for them, and they're pretty conservative in their taste. They
                    liked Bach, or they liked ballet, and they liked the traditional stuff. But they
                    liked the jazz. We had Sara Vaughan. We had The Modern Jazz Quartet as I said.
                    We had the Alvin Ailey Dancers. We had a good bunch of people and always had
                    crowds, because we priced them as I told you, at a price that they could pay.
                    Movies weren't coming in. What movies they had were movies that they had in
                    their inventory at the time of the Allende election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is financial. They couldn't afford to pay any...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, that's true; the foreign exchange wasn't there.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>On the other hand, in the grand scheme of things, at the time Allende fell, he
                    had more foreign exchange than he had had when he came in. Now the foreign
                    exchange wasn't our foreign exchange, it was just Europe's foreign exchange. But
                    he had foreign exchange. They just weren't able to get things like the latest
                    movies from California. What he had often were products that weren't any good.
                    We'd done this in countries ourselves, bringing tractors in from Romania without
                    spare parts. They broke down, and because other vehicles weren't available, they
                    tended to use them on the highways rather than the fields, which meant they
                    broke down even faster. There they sat after they broke down. So he was wasting
                    a lot of his foreign exchange. But he had money; that wasn't the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Eastern money though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It was Eastern money, tied money if you will, but then ours is too. It
                    wasn't going the right places. Because the miners were more radical than he was,
                    they were having strikes. They weren't on the team, he thought. So they were
                    having strikes. They didn't have the production of copper; copper price was
                    bottom lining at that time as well. The farmers, the landlords weren't planting,
                    so you that you didn't have the food coming in. They were going to lose their.
                    So the whole economy was falling apart, and not because of anything other than
                    bad direction. If Allende had been a dictator, done what he wanted to do and had
                    the power to do it, he'd have gone through it all right. But he was a political
                    president; he was not an efficient president. The people who really had agendas
                    on his side walked over him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, it was. So they had Cubans coming in, but not in a cultural sense.
                    They came down as medical technicians or whatever, but no, we didn't really have
                    competition. Oh, maybe competition from the Germans perhaps, a good thing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Including police, it was a four-man group. We were struggling to find food
                    to eat. I'd had those U.S. swimmers, I think I told you last time, and they ate
                    us out of the house and home. When the 24-hour curfew stopped, we had to dash
                    out as soon as we could to get some food. It was just the logistics of living
                    that we were concerned with initially. A guy across the street who was there, I
                    guess with the Geological Survey, he'd been down there 17 years. Can you imagine
                    an American employee down there 17 years straight? He had a Chilean wife, he had
                    a Chilean house, he had a Chilean family, and he retired down there after that
                    tour. He had a short wave ham set operating, and he pitched in at the request of
                    the junta to convey messages out to the outside world because it was pretty well
                    shut down. But he was an exception, involving himself directly into the coup.
                    The rest of us...</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no, there was no real opposition. The military, Pinochet was not in
                    favor of it. This was pushed by the, well, first the air force was primarily
                    interested. But they weren't big enough to make a difference. It was the navy
                    who made the difference. The navy came in after that radical senator from
                    Valparaiso tried a coup in the fleet, and then the navy came down solidly and
                    said, “This is it.” Pinochet had no choice as head of the army. He had to come
                    in or be isolated, and then there would have been a civil war. But he didn't
                    think he had the strength, and he probably didn't to hold things on. His
                    predecessor, Prats -</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Who was killed, he would have been willing to try to hold it for Allende,
                    because that was law and order. But once Pinochet pulled into the junta, then of
                    course took over because they had the largest land force, there wasn't any
                    possibility of a successful civil war.</p>
                <p>Q: Up to that point, my understanding was that, particularly the army, was seen

                <p>GOOD: Apolitical though, means that they are supporting the government, not out
                    of it, not neutral. It was, when it was pointed out to Pinochet that he could no
                    longer be supporting the government if the government was Allende, that he had
                    to come over on the other side. They weren't neutral, and to that extent, they
                    weren't apolitical. I think Prats might have been a little bit political.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: It's interesting you said that about the navy. When somebody started messing
                    around in the navy, as I recall it, someone earlier in the '60s tried to in
                    Brazil, the leftist tried to get the navy to mutiny and that sort of, you don't
                    mess with the navy at all and so this was...</p>
                <p>GOOD: You don't mess with the navy, by golly. It doesn't matter who you are; the
                    navy is independent, and they're disciplined. They know what they can do, and
                    they know what should be done, and messing with them is a stupid idea, as you
                    all know.</p>

                    which spun off of the mess we've got now there. But, yes, they were involved in
                    the poorer areas of the city. They had projects. Some of them were doing
                    research, but of course as far as the government was concerned, it was
                    conservatives that came in. That was probably not the whole story. They thought
                    that this research, at the very least, was triggering some thinking that wasn't
                    going to be supportive of their policies.</p>

                    at the community level. But they thought that the people should be making

                    was pushing for change, and they didn't want change. They thought things were
                    happy as they were. “So if we're going to get rid of Allende, then we certainly
                    don't want these people left over.” That one student who was killed...</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I saw it finally, and it wasn't bad. It wasn't nearly as irresponsible as I
                    was led to believe, and where they filmed it, obviously wasn't done in Chile
                    because they had a separate embassy, among other things. But it was just an
                    unfortunate situation. He was not attached to the embassy. He was living where
                    the radicals were living. He had gotten caught up in the sweep because he wasn't
                    home. I think he was coming back from Valparaiso, or something, but he was loose
                    and before anybody could get to him, he'd been caught up in the killings in the
                    city, at the stadium.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any idea, you know up to a certain point, I mean outside of the
                    bombing of the presidential palace, those people were so ready for a coup and
                    all of that? There wasn't any great opposition, was it a surprise that somehow,
                    or why did the army turn so vicious?</p>
                <p>GOOD: It's only a guess, (laughing) but I think they had to provtheir decision
                    was genuine.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They were going to join with the junta to clear this mess up, and at the
                    same time, if they didn't take leadership, they weren't going to be the leaders.
                    They were the largest force on land. The navy wasn't interested in running the
                    country. They just wanted to be left alone to protect the country. But the army
                    was very much involved at every local level. The air force wanted its freedom,
                    and they didn't want to mess with the details either. So it was left up to the
                    army, and the army said, “Okay, if we're going to go into this, we're going to
                    go into it in a big way, and we're going to sweep it.” And they did.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you getting any feedback while you were, you know, de gr�ce and the
                    curfew was being lifted and all, about the enormity of what had, what was going
                    on?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No. We were where it was tight. We didn't get out after curfew. People were
                    getting killed there at the checkpoints if they didn't behave themselves, not
                    every night, but there were a number of them. None of us were killed, but we
                    knew that we didn't stop for a red light if you were running tight before
                    curfew. We had some killings at night in our area as well, people who were on
                    the loose, probably trying to get from one place to another. Opposition, that is
                    Allende supporters, and they got caught, or they were trying to escape the
                    roadblock. They weren't people from our neighborhood, just passing through our
                    neighborhood.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: As I said, programming was very disrupted because of the curfew that
                    canceled evening activities. Obviously people were very much engaged in making
                    sure that they had a job, that they were not looked upon as problems by the new
                    authorities, so people kept their heads down. So there wasn't a lot that we
                    could be doing, parts of the embassy whose job was really reporting, in our case
                    the universities were bringing information back, but as an active operation we
                    were sort of out of it, except for the Bi-National Center. It was still
                    continuing, conducting, teaching lessons.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, was there a mass inflow of press or

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>GOOD: No they were there. We had just had a change in the office for reasons that
                    are too complicated to discuss. The cultural officer and the informational
                    officer switched positions. The cultural officer, the new one, who was bilingual
                    in Spanish and Portuguese, was comfortable, and he didn't have to think. The new
                    one on the information side had never been an information officer before and was
                    not a great language speaker. It was not his first language or second language.
                    The pressure on him as the embassy spokesman was so great that he broke out with
                    tremendous hives, and he had to go into isolation for a month. Had they left the
                    other fellow in charge, he could have handled it easily because he knew the job,
                    and he had the language, and he understood the culture much better, and that was
                    unfortunate. So there was, yes, there were press; there was pressure.</p>
                <p>Although we weren't the focus of it, we were close enough to the fringes of what
                    was actually going on that we got involved because obviously we had some
                    missing. The people that had contact with the embassy, two of them, we had
                    Hayes-Fulbright scholars down there, and we got them out, although they got some
                    beatings before we could get to them. But they were registered; we knew about
                    them and went after them. This other guy just hadn't bothered to check with us,
                    check in with the consulate, didn't want to be contaminated by the
                    consulate.</p>

                <p>Q: Did you get any, were you picking up through the outrage that was coming from
                    particularly I'd say the anti-Nixon of groups in the States, in particular, the
                    glitterati and all that?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your contacts in Chilean circles? Were they

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, you know, if you don't have an evening life, our contacts, the art
                    galleries weren't going to be open, the concerts weren't open, the cafes weren't
                    open, you went home.</p>

                <p>GOOD: After it began to open up a little bit, you would have some people over,
                    and when you finished your dessert, they ran. You didn't have the after dinner
                    talk. You had some drinks, you had your dinner and talked during that time, and
                    then they had to go because of the curfew because you know, Chileans tend to
                    start late. It was a hardship socially on them when this curfew was on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, having dinner at seven or eight?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: You go to the concert; you go to the art activities at seven, seven-thirty,
                    you go have tea right after work; you don't go home, you have tea, and then you
                    go to the opera or whatever, then you go to dinner.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Then they sleep late. We had to get to the embassy at eight, not nine.
                    Finally the cultural officer rebelled and said, “I'm not coming in before nine.
                    This is too much!” And she wasn't allowed to return for a second tour. Halsema
                    didn't like her. Her real sin was that she refused to be a political officer.
                    She said, “Look, my job is the cultural officer job, and I have plenty to do
                    without going out and turning in reports for you. If I pick something up, I'll
                    tell you about it, but I'm not going to write a report on it. I haven't time for
                    that.” And he didn't like that.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Francis Coughlin, great gal. She had the language, she was single, she was
                    a pilot, she'd been in the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency
                    Service), or was it the WACs (Women's Army Corps).</p>

                <p>GOOD: WAFS, okay. She had really worn herself out. When she left, she flew out,
                    her private plane flew out and landed in La Paz and she collapsed. They flew her
                    out from there. She'd just had exhausted herself, tremendous work. She came back
                    to Peru and I saw her afterwards. I haven't seen her since; she's long retired.
                    But she was too independent for Jim Halsema.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problems with this or where you able to
                        sort oduck them, the political side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: You mean the internal embassy problem? Q: Yes.</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, I got right in the middle of it. We had a rebellion. We had 12 officers
                    I guess. Nine of us joined up and demanded a confrontation with the PAO. Okay.
                    The information officer and the cultural officer stayed back. The cultural
                    officer was really on our side, but both of them had reports written by PAOs.
                    They weren't going to be right there in the center. But they were there in the
                    same room monitoring. We sat there, and the assistant information officer and I,
                    deputy cultural officer, spent, I think we spent, two hours detailing to the PAO
                    his inadequacies and how it was affecting our programming. We said that and
                    explained why. We said, “He was not a communicator, he was not a programmer, he
                    was not an administrator.”</p>
                <p>Now shortly after I left, I transferred up to Colombia directly before home leave
                    on that one, and before I got out on home leave, out of Colombia, there was a
                    surprise inspection of Chile. On their way down the inspectors stopped to talk
                    to any of us who were still around and had been down there. They yanked Halsema
                    out because he had overspent $185,000. This was in June of '74. He was a
                    terrible administrator, a brilliant guy. He had an attention span though of less
                    than two minutes. So if you went in to see him, you knew that you had to get it
                    out immediately because he'd switch to this or that; you weren't there.</p>
                <p>Values may have been a problem. But he was, as his wife said, “Look, I can't
                    divorce him now, because I've got too many years invested, but I understand your
                    problem.” She was an electrical engineer, and she was organized. He had six
                    kids; three of them were crazy, literally, in and out of the institutions. Three
                    of them were wonderful just like the mother.</p>
                <p>But he was the senior USIA Foreign Service officer. What could you do? They
                    brought him back, put him at the desk, empty desk, he didn't have any job, and
                    then he retired, because they got him on a 60-year limit, remember, just in time
                    to get him out. We said, “Listen, we were told Jim, when we got here, by our
                    supervisors, that if we wanted to get anything, a decision from you, that we'd
                    better get it in writing because you wouldn't remember what you'd said.” And he
                    sat there, I've never seen anybody so white, he was white-faced after that.</p>

                    I suppose, but partly because we knew that as long as he was there, there was no
                    hope. So we all left. Nobody took a second tour.</p>

                    promoted on his watch, not one American. A couple got promotions, but based upon
                    reports before they arrived. But nobody got promoted on a report written while

                <p>GOOD: He had been the executive secretary for the executive committee at the

                    director. His father had been a colonel in the U.S. Army assigned on detail to
                    the Philippines in the '30s, close to MacArthur. He was in concentration camp
                    during the war in the Philippines and apparently memorized their Encyclopedia
                    Britannica while he was there. He had been a journalist after college. He did
                    start at that. He had some money. He bought up the San Miguel shares after the

                    that. It'd be fine. But when I got back from my trip to Tierra del Fuego,
                    vacation trip in must have been February or January '74, I found that the job
                    had been canceled, mostly for budget reasons. I found out later that Halsema had
                    told them, “You don't want this guy, because he's not a yes man.”</p>
                <p>I was then asked if I would go to Colombia where the Bi-National Center director
                    in Bogota had just been medically evacuated home. He lost his one leg below the
                    knee, blood poisoning, and so I said, “Okay.” It was very inconvenient, because
                    my wife and I were planning a divorce and couldn't really do it down there. We
                    needed to get back to the States. So they came with me to Bogota in March and
                    stayed until August, and then we decided we had to get the kids back up to
                    school to start there, and so we did. I later got the divorce out of southern
                    Hispanola.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It was very nice. They didn't have a curfew. You could walk the streets at
                    night and not worry about a mugging, didn't even think about it, very few people
                    on the streets at night. I lived down next to the bullring in a high rise. They
                    were two story apartments; I was on floors 27 and 28, looking to the mountain,
                    which is to the east of the town. Elevation is somewhere around 8,000, 8,500
                    feet at that point, a wonderful climate, just magnificent climate.</p>
                <p>It's a shame that things have gone downhill. But this was sort of in between the
                    La Violencia of the '50s and the problems that started in the '80s. My father in
                    law, now deceased, was a city counselor for forty years, a criminal lawyer and
                    was very frustrated with the inability to move the administration of the
                    government, that's of course the capital of the entire country, into
                    modernizing. They had really done no infrastructure work. They didn't put any
                    new roads in, except the road to the airport on which our new embassy is sited,
                    and none being over the mountains to the plains on the east side, no
                    improvements to the roads to the coast. It's the kind of problem that if you
                    think about trying to do a military exercise in Colombia you're in real trouble,
                    because you can't move. Helicopters, okay, but even helicopters have trouble
                    with the clouds and the mountains. They've got planes that have disappeared
                    decades ago they've never found. If you want to see Colombia you've got to be on
                    the ground. But you're not going to go fast on the ground.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD:.V. Vaky, bless his bureaucratic heart. He felt it necessary to sign every
                    message, every memo, every document that went to the government and that
                    included household effects customs orders. He just didn't know how to release
                    and delegate. His deputy, Robert White was superb. Course, he fell into problems
                    later with the Carter administration in Central America. But he was a real pro.
                    Our PAO, Bob Chatten, was probably the best PAO I've had, arguably one of the
                    two best that I've had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The situation there, what sort of government did they

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: This was still under the alternating system that they'd set up after the La
                    Violencia, where they'd go liberal, conservative, liberal, conservative every
                    four years.</p>
                <p>Q: Reds, blues sort of thing?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes. It was agreed to, like Lebanon went for quite some time. So you really
                    didn't have anything more than a discussion as to who was going to get the
                    nomination for the next party in. It was not progressive looking. They really
                    didn't think to the future very far. My father-in-law was convinced that the
                    only answer was a strong military, but that the military was not capable of
                    making that kind of move. There are some excellent officers, but like so much of
                    Latin America, the military comes from the working class, middle class at best
                    and consequently doesn't have the standing in the class structure that you've
                    got in Latin America.</p>

                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>GOOD: Even if they did that, they weren't capable of judging whether they were
                    getting the right thing. It's like the management of the INS (Immigration &amp;
                    Naturalization Service) today. They're not trained in technology, and so they
                    don't understand that they're making a mess of what Congress had delegated them
                    to do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: She walked in the door soon after I got there. I was there as the
                    Bi-National Center director in Bogota. I had asked that I get a language tutor
                    to beef up my Spanish. She had been a teacher there the year before and earlier
                    when, she finished high school and had taken the bilingual secretarial course,
                    because her father didn't believe that upper class children should go to the
                    university. Boys, yes, her brother was a well-known surgeon in town. She was
                    trying to fight that. She had gotten to the States for junior college here, and
                    she had persuaded her father to let her go to the same university he'd gone to.
                    But then of course, they had student riots, and the university closed down, so
                    she'd gone off to Venezuela, spent a couple years at the Canadian embassy there
                    and came back and was teaching English and Spanish at the Bi-National Center.
                    Then she'd gotten into an accident, a car accident. Her fianc� had smashed head
                    on, and she almost lost her leg and of course had been in the wrong section of
                    town. They took her to the hospital where nobody knew her, in a lower class
                    area. Fortunately somebody got the word to her brother, and he got over there in
                    time to save her leg. She came in to teach me. She had just come back. She was
                    still with a cane, didn't have crutches, but with a cane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We actually didn't do much language teaching study at that point, because
                    no sooner had we gotten started than we fell in love and I didn't want her to be
                    teaching me then at that point. So I did the unpardonable and hired her as my
                    secretary, because I trusted her, and we were having trouble in the Center.</p>
                <p>Give a little background. The person I had replaced as I mentioned earlier had
                    been medically evacuated and ultimately lost the lower part of one of his legs.
                    His predecessor, Ernie Aribe had hired an administrator to run the institution.
                    Soon after he did that, he realized that he'd made a mistake. Now this was two
                    years or so, maybe even three before I got there. He realized the guy was sleazy
                    and corrupt, not the kind of person you wanted in this kind of institution. He
                    tried to fire him, but Alvaro decided that he could fight that one easily, and
                    he began to organize the staff as a union. That was not something the board
                    wanted to touch. So Ernie had to back down and agree, “I will keep you on if you
                    cancel the union organizational efforts.” Fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>My predecessor had a policy that he make no major change in the first year of his
                    stay in any posting. He hadn't quite finished a year when he was evacuated, so
                    he hadn't had a chance yet under his rules to do anything with Alvaro.</p>
                <p>I had no background about this. I was brought up on a direct transfer, postponing
                    home leave to take over because of the med evac (evacuation). On the way over,
                    the CAO (cultural administrative officer), who was taking me said, “Oh, by the
                    way, you are to get rid of Alvaro Bolivar.” That was news to me. The next day I
                    got a memorandum, “Found the PAO,” it said, “You have 90 days to do it.”</p>
                <p>Well, obviously Alvaro decided he would take the same steps that he had taken
                    earlier, and successfully under Ernie, and began to organize the union, which
                    scared the board silly. It turned out that the board, which was half American
                    and half Colombian with a Colombian chairman. The chairman had been handpicked
                    and put in by Ambassador Vaky, one of the Colombian members, an attorney, was
                    the chairman's personal attorney and business attorney.</p>
                <p>Now I'm an attorney and I applied my American ethics to this situation. It turned
                    out the guy was a labor lawyer. I found out also that he was, contrary to the
                    rules of the board, on a retainer from Alvaro, another complication. So I wrote
                    a letter to him, copies to the board, saying that I would appreciate it very
                    much if he could provide me with his advice, since he was on a retainer from the
                    center on what to do with this effort by Alvaro to organize a union. There was
                    an explosion, because he lost face, obviously, and by his losing face, because
                    they found out he was doing something that they didn't approve of, the chairman
                    lost face. So immediately I had two enemies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Didn't make any difference to my job to get rid of Alvaro. I told Alvaro,
                    first of all, to get an audit done. Audit was done and came back with the
                    information that showed that he was a corrupt operator. I told him he had to go,
                    so he went to the chairman, and the chairman went to the ambassador, and told
                    the ambassador that I had lost the confidence of the board. That was his
                    opinion. The board reversed that message by voting me their confidence.</p>
                <p>The ambassador had been briefed by PAO at that point about what the problems
                    were. At that point Bob was on home leave, so it didn't help; it was a month
                    before he came back. In the end, they effected a compromise. The chairman said,
                    “Okay, Alvaro goes.” The Ambassador said, “Good goes.”</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The area director came down from Washington. Dorothy Dillon had served with Vaky
                    in Guatemala some years before, and she thought that maybe she could persuade
                    him to use some good sense. She failed, but her retaliation was to take the
                    assistant cultural officer away who Vaky wanted to keep as his social secretary,
                    if you will. She was a smooth operating Georgian lady. So he lost her, Bob lost
                    me, and we both were sent up to the DR (Dominican Republic).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Dominican Republic. Behind all of this there was another problem. Of course
                    immediately upon the board finding out that the chairman had told the ambassador
                    this, they called in a meeting and said, “We give our full endorsement to Paul”
                    to just tell the chairman what they thought about him. Of course he voted along
                    with them to agree, because he didn't want to lose face anymore at that point.
                    He was the president of the local W.R. Grace Company Branch and also was with
                    the Bank of Bogota. So he was a player in the community.</p>
                <p>There was an interesting sidebar to the meeting in which they thought this out as
                    to whether they'd accept the compromise that the Chatten had worked out with the
                    chairman of the board. I asked if they'd mind if I taped the session, horrible
                    idea in hindsight, and they said no. But half way through the meeting, one of
                    the Colombians on the board, not the lawyers, but an advertising executive,
                    jumped up, snapped open the tape recorder, grabbed a tape, and pulled the tape
                    all over the floor. I guess at that point he realized that this wasn't going to
                    do him any good if it got out. None of this was going to get out; I just wanted
                    to rib him.</p>
                <p>But behind all this there was another problem. That was that when I came to the
                    country I had told Bob that my wife and I had agreed on a divorce, but that we
                    were waiting to go back to the States to finish it up. He knew that, but we
                    didn't put it in the embassy rag. It probably would have been better if we had,
                    because the perception then was that I had found this Colombian girl and was
                    dumping the American girl, an obvious perception if they hadn't the background.
                    So I was called over one day by the PAO, we were in separate parts of town of
                    course, and he said, “The ambassador wants to know if you're sleeping with her,
                    the Colombian girl or whether you're going to get married.”</p>
                <p>I said, “We plan to get married.”</p>
                <p>“Oh,” he said. “Then you've got to get out of the country. This ia totally
                    separate issue to the problem at the center itself.”</p>
                <p>The reason why he said that was his wife was worried that he woulget ideas and
                    dump her.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Mrs. Vaky, who was a good friend to the wife of one of the American
                    members, the finance officer man with the local Chrysler plant, who was also
                    worried that her husband would get these ideas. They wanted to get this example
                    out of the country so that it wouldn't be leaping up at them. Confirmation of
                    this theory as being true came after I left when he bounced the JOT out, who was
                    single, but got involved with local lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: JOT iJunior?</hi>

                <p>GOOD: Junior Officer Trainee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Junior Officer of Trainees.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He was not junior by any means. He had been a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
                    and he was a native born American, but born in Peru and raised down there as a
                    youngster so his Spanish was native! He's currently come back from retirement to
                    handle the exec job in Lagos, very nice fellow. But he was kicked out because he
                    had no clout to it. The ambassador tried to kick out the AID director. Now he
                    lost on that one, both because the AID director had enough clout and because the
                    AID director was officially separated, his wife wasn't in country, and his
                    girlfriend was Brazilian and only came over on occasion. So the ambassador
                    didn't have quite as much of an argument against him. In any event, come
                    November, I was on my way. But I left a record because I raised $125,000, set up
                    the expansion plans with that money for the expansion of the building. We had a
                    center branch in the north part of town. We had 5,000 students. We had a...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what a Bi-National Center in Colombia at
                        thatime did?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>GOOD: Colombia had a very active operation that we had set up back in the '50s
                    where we incorporated locally in a number of communities in the country, an
                    institution whose aim was to provide English language training, access to
                    American cultural presentations, and a library for research. In the Bogota
                    operation we also had a printing plant and an art gallery. We were used as a
                    convenience by the embassy as well, to do things which the embassy regulations
                    would not allow them to do, like we could handle liquor, buy it with the money.
                    They would grant us a sum of money to handle the program for them, and then we
                    could use that money in ways that they couldn't. This was common throughout
                    Latin America where we had these CenterIt was set up with a local citizen as
                    chairman and then equal number of other board members, half of the, in our case,
                    Colombian, and half American. The Americans were, if possible, members of the
                    local community, Americans who might have married a Colombian or at least were
                    on assignment to a Colombian company, American-Colombian branch of an American
                    company. On occasion in some countries, you also had perhaps a member from the
                    embassy. Usually the PAO was ex officio on a board. It raised its own money,
                    although it got quite a bit of support from the embassy. My salary was paid by
                    the embassy, of course. The librarian's salary was paid by the embassy. We
                    provided the books for the library. We brought the printing plant in for the
                    press. We supplied most of the machinery. In other ways, the car for the
                    operation was a castoff from the USIS fleet at the embassy. As a castoff, I can
                    remember one day I tried to shift, and the whole gearshift came off in my hand.
                    It was old. But that was background support. Probably without that the Center
                    wouldn't have made it.</p>
                <p>We had a reasonably good relationship in Colombia at that time in that they,
                    well, the board on the Colombian side was interested in self-promotion in the
                    community, unpaid jobs of course. The embassy was looking for pushing the
                    American agenda. Sometimes those conflicted because we weren't after just a show
                    and publicity for the Colombian interests; we were interested in the American. I
                    wouldn't take that kind of a job again, because there was a conflict of
                    interests for the director as well.</p>
                <p>But we ran a good operation. We had other Centers as well when I arrived. We
                    still had local hire directors in a couple places like Cartagena on the coast,
                    and we had an American down in Medell�n and in Cali. There were a couple of
                    reading rooms left, but mostly they were closing down. In general in South
                    America now, I don't know of any operations which are remaining. We separated
                    our interests finally from this operation. Some of them continued as in Mexico
                    City and Buenos Aires, locally run by the city government cultural center. We
                    had turned around to set up an information center separately and ran our
                    programs through that, because we found ultimately that the conflict of interest
                    was too great. While you could run it fine for a couple of years, down the line,
                    it would turn bad, turn sour, and you'd get locally bad feelings which countered
                    any of the benefits that you were coming up with.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>We had problems in some places with corruption on the American side as well. It
                    wasn't just the host nationals that gave us problems. After I left, they did a
                    study and found that one of the Americans in the community who had been Peace
                    Corps in Malaysia, an architect, had been in connivance and got some juicy
                    contracts without competition, and there was money being bled out. Of course,
                    they didn't do anything about it in Washington. They got the information, but
                    they decided that it wasn't in our best interest to flag it at that point.</p>
                <p>I had a good staff; still have some contact with them. The Webmaster at the
                    embassy is our former librarian, still hanging on. Most of the others left,
                    retired, and so forth. But we did a good job, and there was a lot of interest in
                    the community in English, obviously with 5,000 students, because there was-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, where were the students? Was it mainly a
                        businesorientation that they were doing then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They wanted it to improve their chances of getting better jobs in their
                    businesses. Yes, they were mostly business people, young people in the main.
                    They knew that business with the States was the way things were going. That's
                    where the money was, and if they had the English, then their company could use
                    them, and they'd step up. They worked hard. We had a good set of teachers. Some
                    were Americans who were passing through and decided to stay for a while and
                    teach. Others had really moved into the country some time back, maybe married a
                    Colombian and decided to settle in Bogota, all kinds of reasons behind why they
                    were there. One of my curriculum supervisors then joined the USIA a couple of
                    years later, and I saw her next in South Africa. She came out as the branch
                    officer for Cape Town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: She's since retired, but she had purchased an apartment next to my
                    apartment building, I suspect she still has it. As I said the other day, we
                    didn't have that much contact with the embassy because we were far away, a
                    couple miles, and with the traffic as it was, I got over there for staff
                    meetings usually, but I didn't have much else to do with it.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you feel that there was any point at this point in challenging your sudden
                    departure, or did you feel what the hell, just get out?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>GOOD: Ah, you know the system as well as I do, and there wasn't a way it looked
                    to fight it. The ambassador is the boss. EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity)
                    actions might be possibly brought now back here against him, but not in those
                    days. Things have changed. I was not that upset about it. I liked Bogota, I
                    still like Colombia of course, but I came into the Foreign Service, not to fight
                    the system, but to see the world. Here's a ready-made opportunity to see another
                    part of it faster than I'd expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did USIA respond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They didn't hold it against me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, as far as you were concerned, did they put you on
                        a blaclist or just say, “Oh hell, let's give him another job?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, they had another job. I mean the area director was on my side. I didn't
                    have any problems with her. I saw her the other day down at the Kennedy Center.
                    She's still around, very professional, probably our first high flying female
                    officer-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was she Dorothy Dillon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Dorothy Dillon, great person, really a classy lady. She knew how to run an
                    organization, and she knew how to still remain a woman, unlike what we'd been
                    picking up since the mid-'70s, conflict of identity I suppose. We've had it for
                    a lot of our junior officers coming in. I'm retired; I can say that.</p>
                <p>Because she was on my side, and continued to be on my side, there's trouble later
                    when I go to the DR experience, I didn't have any problems with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did they send you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Santo Domingo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I didn't have any preconceptions because I'd never been there. I didn't
                    know it at that point, but I hated islands. I learned that after I got
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>But on the way to there, I took the long route. I flew to Panama City and then
                    took the bus from there, country by country, one country a day until I got to
                    over by Guadalajara in Mexico. Then I took the train across through the
                    mountains, the larger-than-Grand Canyon canyon they've got there. Then I took
                    the bus up to El Paso and the bus over to Los Angeles and took a train up to
                    Vancouver, B.C., and across to Winnipeg, where I ran out of time, which was a
                    strange thing, because I hadn't finished my 20 minimum days. But Washington
                    thought that they had promised the PAO in DR that I would be there by the fifth
                    of January. When I got there, she said, “Why are you here? It's wintertime, and
                    the universities are not in session. It's vacation. People aren't here. It won't
                    be ready until next month. You should have stayed away.”</p>
                <p>Well it was too late at that point, and they gave me a waiver on the 20 days. But
                    I saw the family up in Portland, Oregon, and that was fine; they were doing all
                    right. I started out then to be a CAO in the DR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Dominican Republic from '75 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: '75, another short tour, from January to September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Short of water. Politically it was dull. It was well past '65 when they'd
                    had the invasion. Bosch and Balaguer were still fighting about Balaguer, who was
                    in. It was slow, it was fairly expensive, it was different, and it was
                    interesting. The cultural complex that they had built near the embassy was
                    magnificent, a great place to show the moon rock when it came through, and we
                    had a very interesting programming possibility there. Gulf and Western, the big
                    American company, had a lot of investment there. They had the sugarcane plant
                    down on the coast, they had a lot of hotels, and there was a currency problem.
                    You couldn't export all the money that they were making. So they did what Spain
                    did, or what the tourist organizations in Spain did. They decided to take the
                    tourists' money in New York in dollars, keep the dollars up there of course, and
                    then use their profits to pay for the operation of their tourist industry in
                    their hotels, so they had local money to burn. The ambassador didn't have much
                    to do. He decided, “This is a big American company, I'd like to deal with them,
                    they've got money, and we can have fun.” He was a great guy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Robert A. Hurwitz. He was the one that got convicted of misusof government
                    property and had to retire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll put it in later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Okay, I meant to look his name up last night. He got into trouble of course
                    with the government. There were three counts. They said that he had used
                    leftover government lumber to build a beach house, that he had forced the
                    defense attach� out of his office, which was separate from the embassy, in order
                    to group the American Women's Club in there because his daughter was the
                    president of the club, and that he used representation funds to hold a wedding
                    reception for his daughter who got married in post.</p>
                <p>The background was that the B and F officer, they called it B and M officer
                    there, it was one of the giant administrative posts, didn't like the ambassador,
                    didn't like the way that he was going, and he blew the whistle. The ADM officer,
                    who was an AID fellow, had not stepped in or made any efforts to make sure the
                    ambassador didn't get into trouble, just said yes, yes, yes. I don't know the
                    merits of it, but the local population couldn't figure out why we were upset
                    with the ambassador. He didn't do anything they wouldn't do, and so he stayed on
                    and became a lobbyist/investment advisor for Taiwanese money coming into
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He was treated far more importantly than the American ambassador, because
                    they knew him. Now he did himself in there ultimately, because he was on his
                    second marriage when I was there, lovely lady. He divorced her and married an
                    ex-wife of the first secretary of the Venezuelan embassy. That didn't go over so
                    well. That was after I left. But he's the only ambassador I've ever known, who's
                    said at a party, “Don't you stay for me to leave before the bell. I'm going to
                    stay all night. I love to dance,” and he would roll up the carpets all night.
                    But he got himself involved with these cultural programs, so I was left without
                    a job. That's what it amounted to. There wasn't that much exchange work going
                    on. We didn't really have cultural presentations except as it was under this
                    program. As soon as the ambassador got involved in it, quite promptly the PAO
                    decided that she better be involved with it. I know logically that's exactly
                    what I would have done if I were the PAO. So all of that was gone. I didn't have
                    anything to do. So I went to her and I said, “Barbara.” This is Barbara
                    Hutchinson, who was our hero because she was kidnaped and held for 17 days
                    before they released her. I didn't know her before that. She had already been
                    through that experience when I arrived.</p>

                    <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, she ran into that in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, at post. She didn't get pulled out after that; she stayed on. But they
                    tell me that she wasn't the same person. Her personality had changed. I don't
                    know, because I didn't know her before. But I do know that within two weeks
                    after my fianc� arrived, she came up from Bogot�, and I did one of those DR
                    divorces, a bilateral one with my ex- wife agreeing. My present wife Barbara
                    arrived, made a pass at her and was refused. Now I didn't know that, but I did
                    know that all of a sudden my relations with the PAO suffered a severe change.
                    And it wasn't until some years later that my wife told me what had happened. She
                    said, no, of course, and that hurt. That hurt very much, because when I went to
                    Barbara to say, “Look, you've taken over the cultural presentation job, which is
                    a major part of my job. Let me do the admin (administrative) work for you,
                    because I'm good at that, I have experience with that, and you don't like it.
                    You've said you don't like it,” she got defensive, thought I was trying to take
                    over and so wouldn't let me do it. Keogh, the director of the agency, came
                    through shortly thereafter with Dorothy Dillon, on a trip of the area. I
                    presented her with the problem, and she tried to get Barbara to change her mind
                    and let me do the admin so that she could concentrate on the cultural side.
                    Dorothy got nowhere with her either. So Dorothy convinced Keogh to curtail my
                    assignment and get me onto something else, because there was obviously no reason
                    for me to be there.</p>
                <p>Ted Boyd was also there at the time. I found him in my office the day I arrived.
                    He was a JOT, junior officer, the longest running JOT I've ever met. He was in
                    that category for five years. He had been a state communicator, Addis (Addis
                    Ababa), took the test, was selected to come in, his wife in Ethiopia, she's an
                    Eritrean, and decided to marry her. They came back together to Washington. We
                    had a rule then, an unwritten rule; you may remember it. I'm not sure State had
                    it, but certainly USIA did. If you married a foreigner, you had to stay in the
                    States for three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, generally this is it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's long, long ago, but that's what the rule was. So there he sat in
                    Washington. He got himself a Master's degree in the process. That was good. Then
                    they sent him off to his first posting, the DR. He was sitting there doing
                    nothing, but reading paperbacks because Barbara wouldn't let him do anything,
                    except once a week on Wednesday afternoons he could go over and do some student
                    counseling at the Bi-National Center we had in the DR. So he was very
                    frustrated.But he's a good phlegmatic type guy, background, Baptist minister's
                    son, big guy. He's still in. He won his EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity
                    Commission) suit and stayed in. His wife won her EEOC suit and got a double
                    promotion, and she's still in. They've done very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>But he wasn't doing well there. He couldn't get out of JOT status because he
                    didn't have his language certification. His Spanish was fine, but FSI didn't
                    have money to send anybody to do the test. So when Dorothy came down. I said,
                    “Dorothy, look, here's the problem. Would you please when you go back, get FSI
                    to authorize a tape test. I'd done one of those in Thai when I was overseas.” I
                    knew it existed. She did, they did, he took his test, he passed it, and he still
                    couldn't get out.</p>
                <p>I was livid at that point. His wife was pregnant. They were assigned to Bolivia,
                    couldn't take her down there. They couldn't have a baby at that height, so he
                    was (laughing) stuck a little bit longer. He really had a tough time. He kept
                    his cool throughout. He had been there through the kidnaping. So he saw her on
                    both sides, and I suppose most of my perception was coming from him. He had
                    enjoyed that time, because he was running the place. He had been the only
                    American officer in USIS at that point and was able to do everything, and then
                    she came back and cut him off at the knees, and he had nothing to do. So he was
                    frustrated.</p>
                <p>So, Keogh gets back to Washington, and somebody in his office convinces him,
                    probably personnel, “but you can't do that, it would set a bad precedent.” It
                    would indicate that Washington's going to second guess the PAO, and he hadn't
                    been down there so long, and it wouldn't look good for Barbara, and so on. So
                    Keogh reversed himself. That was I think in May at that time.</p>
                <p>I learned another trick in August. The area director could not make a change
                    without the director's approval, but personnel could. If the area director was
                    on leave, personnel could make that decision. Dorothy went on leave in August.
                    Rob Nevitt, my boss from Ubol, Thailand, instantly, as deputy director of
                    personnel, cut my orders and brought me out. But Barbara got her axe in at that
                    point. We went through my OER (Officer Efficiency Report); it was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the efficiency report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It's the efficiency report at that point at post. She said, “I don't have
                    it typed up,” because she delayed and delayed and delayed about our leaving, “so
                    I'll send it on.” What she sent on was not what she had in draft when I saw her,
                    and was so bad and so full of improper references, that when it got to personnel
                    in Washington later management said, “Impossible.” Now the panel was meeting at
                    that point, and they had seen it. Two of the three members on my panel were
                    friends of mine from Chile. I'm not sure with that, even a changed report,
                    whether they'd have been able to promote me at that point. I was eligible
                    otherwise. But personnel pulled the report, so I had nothing to be judged on.
                    The panel was angry because they wanted to write something for her file for
                    having improperly drafted an efficiency report.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>That hurt; that hurt badly because I had a hole in my filThe hole couldn't be
                    filled because Earl Klitenic, who was head of personnel and for whom I worked
                    recently at the Voice, he's still over there, didn't think that she would agree
                    to do anything better. It was so bad that even if she had sanitized it, she
                    would make sure that whatever went in was going to be negative because she was
                    still mad about the fact that my wife turned her down. Well, we got her; my wife
                    put a good South American curse on her. She died a few years later, so she's
                    gone.</p>
                <p>I feel a bit sorry for her because to be a woman in the information business in
                    South America, at least in those years, was very difficult. She couldn't shmooze
                    with the guys, and all the journalists really that mattered were male. The
                    papers closed late. She really couldn't do what a man could do. Now a man doing
                    what a man can do often times burned himself out because it was very, very
                    taxing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But she couldn't do it. It's not quite as bad as an information female
                    officer in a Muslim country, but down toward that end of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: So I wasn't unhappy about leaving the DR because obviously I didn't have
                    anything to do, and I found I didn't like to be surrounded by water. I confirmed
                    that when I came back on a PAO conference later when I was in Surinam. I had an
                    instant feeling of discomfort. It might have been all right if we'd been
                    assigned in the interior of Santiago, which is the old capital, the old natural
                    capital, the old center for the upper class, the branches and so forth. The
                    highest mountain in the Caribbean is there just on the side of Santiago, or
                    maybe up in the north where the beaches were. But the south beach, as is the
                    custom of the Spanish settlers, was on the rough shore because it was more
                    protected when it comes to invasions. The beaches were few, and the waves were
                    wild, and I just didn't like it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they brought you back, did you go back to
                        Washingtoitself? You were about due anyway, weren't you really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I was due, yes. I should have come back, as I said, at the end of Chile
                    because I had the assignment all set. This also made it very obvious that it was
                    Jim Halsema who had canceled my job up there, because no sooner had they
                    canceled the job, and I'd moved on, than labor management recreated the job and
                    put Earl Klitenic down there.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>So I didn't have a smooth route those two years, but it was only two years. But
                    it killed me. I never got another promotion in the next twenty years,
                    twenty-five years, twenty-six years. I beat the system, but I was dead in the
                    water, which again didn't bother me particularly, because as you know the senior
                    assignments in the agency are not the best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, they're not as much fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They're not as much fun. There's much more choice at the mid level and I
                    was mid level, and I was making as much money as the guy ahead because I had so
                    many years in. I topped out at 14-10. They raised the cap a few years ago. I was
                    up there within the money, and I had a marvelous list of assignments, 11 in
                    total on five continents. I keep counting the number of countries that people in
                    the obituary column have gone to. There was a communicator recently who had 11.
                    But part of his were, after he retired with his wife who continued on, and so he
                    captured some countries that she was assigned to, but he was the unemployed
                    spouse. Eleven is just out of sight for a regular Foreign Service officer. I
                    haven't found any Foreign Service officer who's had that many. So I came out
                    ahead personally. My wife of course wasn't so happy that I didn't have the
                    stature of the embassy, but I had the gray hair. What difference does it
                    make?</p>
                <p>So I came back to Washington and was assigned to the Interagency TasForce for
                    Indochina.</p>

                <p>GOOD: That's right. This was the close of Vietnam, the evacuation from Saigon. It
                    had already been an operation for some months. I came in and was first placed in
                    the press relations' office. A couple of weeks later they shifted me. They
                    needed help in the Congressional Liaison Office. Kay Clarke-Bourne, another
                    wonderful Foreign Service officer, who had been kicked out of the government
                    because, and if you haven't interviewed her you really should.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Kay Clarke with an E-Bourne, B-O-U-R-N-E, and she's in the city. She had to
                    retire at 65. But she got axed out because she got married back in the '60s in
                    India. She married the grandson of the co-inventor of the Singer sewing machine,
                    but you couldn't be a female married FSO.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: So it wasn't a money problem, but she was stubborn, as she'll tell you in
                    happy detail. She hung on for eight months. They took away her desk, they took
                    away her access to the country team meeting, and then they wouldn't give her a
                    return ticket to New York. She ultimately got refunded for the money her husband
                    put out to get her home, but she was out for eight years before she came back.
                    But she came back, and she was running this portion under Julia Taft, who's of
                    course is back here as an assistant secretary now, the Congressional Liaison
                    Office. I also met her then shortly thereafter when I got to Nigeria; she was
                    the head of the political section.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We were responding to Congressional questions about whatever was going on.
                    We had prepared statements. We also would deal with the public questions as
                    well, as they came in. We had boilerplate answers to letters that would come in.
                    One of our different people at Congress was Sarbanes. He was-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, he was running for the Senate for his first term and tried to make a
                    name, and he was being pretty rough with the members of the Interagency Task
                    Force that he called over for hearings. If you look at their headlines, he
                    wasn't particularly sympathetic; I think he's moderated himself a good deal
                    since. But he came out across at that time as being very domestically oriented,
                    which I guess you'd have to be at that time if you started out in politics at
                    the Senate level. That was interesting. It was fun to see Julia the other day
                    when I was checking out retirement over at...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Julia Taft</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Julia Taft, who has been in the migration humanitarian business ever since,
                    a great boss. She just really is competent and well placed and comfortable with
                    her responsibilities. I'm pleased that they've been able to keep her occupied at
                    State all these years. I guess she spent some time with AID, but basically in
                    the same kind of business. When that job faded, I went back to the agency and
                    looked for a next assignment. I was very fortunate to find a very interesting
                    job in post management, we call it a post management systems officer; State
                    calls them PMOs (Post Management Officers) for Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa. I had
                    an executive officer tour under my belt back in Thailand, my PO (Principal
                    Officer) support counted as executive, and of course I had field experience, and
                    when it comes to Africa, I was available, so that gives you an edge right there.
                    I spent a couple of months reading in because things had changed in Africa since
                    I had finished the university, undergraduate university. I had to learn names, I
                    had to learn name changes, and I had to learn geographical units. I know that
                    it's not quite proper to say black Africa, but in the sense that it was a place
                    that had no light, that is it was an empty hole, I had to color it. I had to
                    identify, I had to get some parameters, I had to find out where I was, and so it
                    was very useful to read in. I, of course, was doing some study on the executive
                    side as well to make sure that I was ready to be the troubleshooter that they
                    were looking for.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>They had a great deal of difficulty filling the job that was traveling just
                    Africa, and so as soon as I got out of the job, they couldn't find a
                    replacement. They had to split it. So they split the job half Europe, half
                    Africa, and a second person half Europe, half Africa to give them a little
                    break, because it still is very difficult to travel constantly in Africa. Unlike
                    the State PMOs, we were in the field 50 percent of the time, literally 50
                    percent of the time. We continued that all the way through to our merger with
                    State. It was a very taxing travel job.</p>
                <p>We would hit the trouble countries about once a quarter, places like Chad where
                    they didn't have experienced PAOs; they didn't have good local support staff.
                    Put it this way, I was a Washington based PMO who was supervising a number of
                    regional American post management officers in Africa who were based in Africa.
                    The person who had been covering Chad before I started to travel had trained
                    this one lady repeatedly and unsuccessfully. She was the wife of the minister of
                    education, so it was difficult to get rid of her, and the woman just didn't have
                    it. I don't know what she was outside work, she may have been a very pleasant
                    social person, but she just didn't understand how to operate an office. So I'd
                    go in and I'd do a little training; basically doing the same training every time
                    I came up to clean it up to the point where they could then continue for a while
                    longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't understand. She was a citizen of the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, she was the local hired administrative assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Local employee, and USIS was separate. Chad was particularly interesting
                    location because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we were having the wars at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, it hadn't started yet. I mean there were problems up in the north but
                    it hadn't affected the south particularly, and so it was still a very desired
                    place to visit without any worries. Some years before, I think 14 years before,
                    somebody at the embassy had executed a lease contract to buy on a storefront on
                    the main road in the town, and nobody had paid any attention to it. All these
                    years we had just continued paying the rent and that FBO just sort of figured it
                    was a rental arrangement with a long-term lease. About the time I arrived, the
                    landlord notified the embassy that it was now theirs. That FBO (laughing) was
                    just really upset. It was a storefront, literally a dump. It had some space in
                    the back for parking. It wasn't a bad thing for what we were using it for, but
                    it's not something the U.S. government ought to have, and all of a sudden, there
                    they had it.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I remember one visit I was waiting to get to the airport; it was a late evening
                    flight. I was sitting at PAO's desk doing my report up before I left, and some
                    liquid began to drop on my paper. I looked up and there was a bat in the vent
                    above me. I chased it down, and I got the wastebasket turned over on top of it
                    and left it there, didn't tell the PAO what he was going to find the next
                    morning. (Laughing) I don't know what his expression was when he found that. The
                    tsetse flies that were also in the area, I've never seen a local employee move
                    any faster or as fast as they did when they saw a tsetse fly. They were up with
                    the can to spray that, (slapping noise) like that, because they were so
                    scared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Encephalitis, sleeping sickness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, and the first time I encountered it on the ground to see the contrast
                    between where it was and where it wasn't, was in Nigeria. I was driving north
                    and about 45 minutes into the zone it finally dawned on me something was
                    different. Then I realized, “Yes, there's nothing living.” You don't see
                    animals; there were some people occasionally, but nothing like you'd see
                    elsewhere. For about a two-hour stretch it was dead. Now they would bring cattle
                    down from the north to that area into Lagos for sale, slaughter, consumption,
                    but they couldn't risk keeping them alive very long after they got up to that
                    zone because they would probably have been bitten. It's a stunningly, massive,
                    physical difference when we're in that encephalitis zone, sleeping sickness
                    zone, etc.</p>
                <p>Back to the PMO job. As I said, we traveled 50 percent of the time. I was
                    responsible for everything south of the Sahara except Sudan. Sudan was part of
                    the Middle East. CIA has it as part of Africa, and AID does too, but USIA and
                    State decided to keep it above. I didn't visit Mauritania. Mauritania at that
                    time was also considered part of the Middle East Bureau of North Africa. It
                    shifted later back into Africa. So I had everything from Dakar, which was the
                    usual point of entry on Pan Am, to South Africa and over to Somalia, up to
                    Ethiopia, Mali, Niger, Chad, and so forth, and all that between. I did not get
                    to a few countries. I didn't on the ground in Angola; I flew over it of course.
                    I didn't get to Burundi and Rwanda. We didn't have posts there. I didn't get to
                    Mozambique, although I later got to its border when I was in South Africa.
                    Eritrea wasn't separate at that time. My first job was supposed to be going up
                    to close our post in Asmara, but by the time I go to Addis Ahaha, Arthur Lewis,
                    who was the PAO at that time, decided that it was too dangerous to travel up
                    there; this was in '75. So I didn't get up to Eritrea. I later traveled Sudan,
                    of course, out of the Middle East, but I didn't get to Central African Republic,
                    I didn't get to Sao Tome and Principe, and I didn't get into Equatorial Guinea,
                    although I, of course, saw it. You can see Fernando Po, now calleMalabo, from
                    Victoria in Cameroon, the old British Cameroon, but I didn't get on the island.
                    But I think everywhere else I did, including Madagascar.</p>

                <p>Q: I would think that the USIA effort would have had in the greater scheme of
                    things in this part of Africa a fairly low priority in USIA's...</p>
                <p>GOOD: Budgetwise, yes. But, did you serve in Africa?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The way things operate in Africa it is a very personal type of operation.
                    Not having resources is not a great drawback to being an effective programmer in
                    the African countries. A society is small in most places. The opinion makers are
                    a smaller number. South Africa is an exception, of course; it's got more
                    educated people. We had a small cultural program, mostly run out of the regional
                    office in Paris. The fellow cultural performers, mimes, musical groups, or
                    whatever in Africa were paid for by resources given to the resource center in
                    Paris, so it didn't cost the post anything. Exchange budgets were heavily funded
                    by Washington so that your budget on a one-man post probably ran $125,000 or
                    less. That was fine because with what you were paying rent and salaries, you
                    might have had five local employees, and a car. Often the car was purchased by
                    Washington money, too. You didn't have to take it out of your budget. These
                    comparatively massive expenses every four or five years were too great to be
                    fitted into a steady budget. You'd have a little bit of representation, there
                    would be some allowances, but of course those were mostly paid out of Washington
                    funds. So, yes, it was a low priority from the Washington point of view, but it
                    was probably as effective as we would have had in Thailand.</p>
                <p>Now to illustrate what you're saying as very accurate. When I was in Thailand, we
                    had 125 vehicles for the USIS post countrywide. That was more vehicles than they
                    had in all the USIS posts in sub-Saharan Africa at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, cost effective...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Cost effective I was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got a lot of bang for the buck.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, because the embassies are small. The ambassador is going to use the
                    PAO like he would any of his other staff, focusing on the educational and media
                    parts of society. And as you know, the USIS contacts are the broadest in the
                    embassy, because they aren't limited to a particular section. They focus on
                    those media and university outlets and a few of the ministries, culture
                    information or whatever you got, but they also are contacting everybody else
                    too. They're involved not so much with the military, but they're involved with
                    the politicians, they're involved with the government ministers, the
                    bureaucracy. They have an excuse to see anybody, if only because they're dealing
                    with the exchange program. So any PAO is a valuable asset for the ambassador in
                    a small country because they can be counted on to know more people than anyone
                    else, maybe not as deeply as a political officer with those political contacts,
                    but they know them, and can give a broader perspective to the ambassador of
                    what's going on.</p>
                <p>We had mostly one-man posts in Africa. Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa. Zaire
                    (Democratic Republic of Congo) were exceptions. Ethiopia had, I think, three
                    people. Tanzania I think had two. Kenya had two or three. At the time of
                    independence when we moved in our operations in most of these countries, it was
                    hard to find qualified employees. There was not a large selection to choose
                    from. Zaire perhaps was the worst of these as an example. They had what, 10
                    university graduates at the time of independenc?</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: This was where they had to find people for the government, not just for us
                    at the embassies. I got to Nigeria; I was traveling Africa in '75 on, so this is
                    15 years after Nigeria's independence. The past had been working on finding an
                    educated coordinator there were now more qualified people beginning to appear on
                    the horizon, but it was harder to get them because first off, the government was
                    also hiring and secondly, the senior locals were so unqualified. So however
                    interested and willing our staffs might be, they tended to be under qualified
                    for the jobs that they were having to do. This is when the tradition of the
                    bicycle messenger ultimately ending up as your information specialist really
                    hurt.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: In my opinion, in most of these posts you're better off having your
                    cultural specialists and your information specialist changed every five years so
                    that they can then move on into government positions of responsibility giving
                    you a tremendous entr�e into the government. There's no sense in having them die
                    on the vine in your office. As I said, in Chile our top information specialist
                    at the embassy when I was there then turned into the press attach� or press aide
                    for General Pinochet afterwards, and the embassy had a tremendous access. He'd
                    worked for Ford before he came to us. Shifting around he'd broadened his
                    network, he kept his credibility all right, and he did everybody a world of
                    good. We didn't have that luxury at that time yet in Africa. So it meant that
                    the trouble-shooting role was more important because they just didn't have the
                    skills on the ground. This applied to many of the Americans as well. A lot of
                    the Americans went there because they couldn't go anywhere else.</p>
                <p>I can remember one PAO back when the fiscal year ran from the first of July to
                    June. One of our guys was assigned to West Africa. Niger I think it was. He
                    spent his budget by November. That was not a lot of money, not a big budget, but
                    still they had to yank him out, put somebody else in there. He was the kind of
                    guy who would fly back from the post to the States and buy something in Paris on
                    the way and arrive back in Washington without money for a taxi, totally out of
                    it when it comes to budgeting. He applied that same marvelous talent to the
                    office budget. Okay as a programmer, but he had to be kept on a leash. So they
                    sent him over to Cameroon and let the PAO take care of him there. So there was a
                    lot of work for the troubleshooter coming through and a lot of rescuing.</p>
                <p>I can remember getting into Gabon one time on special assignment because
                    Washington couldn't figure out why the PAO was virtually out of money. Great
                    guy, he knew Africa well, a French wife, a great cook. He had done the space
                    tours of Africa earlier on. He just was a marvelous guy. I got there and I
                    looked at what he'd done. What he had done was to take a driver position and
                    shift it to an information specialist position with an increased salary load
                    without getting any new money. With of budget of $125,000 all of sudden you have
                    a $10,000 increase in salaries, you're in trouble. Well, Washington bailed him
                    out, because they concluded that the new RSN was worth. They probably needed the
                    guy and he was a Beninois. And if you know, the Beninois were the intellectuals
                    of West Africa. So he was a good guy, very, very capable. The PAO was a fine guy
                    too, and they didn't want to lose him. That's the kind of thing that I had to go
                    in to do, make sure that the embassy wasn't upset with what USIS was doing, calm
                    some of the problems that might have come up. As you remember ADM officers
                    weren't always happy with PAOs. I had credibility because I had been, and I was
                    still a Foreign Service officer, a career program officer. Coming in I could
                    talk to the PAO as an equal rather than coming as one of these ADM types that
                    probably doesn't know what's going on, why we're here. It gave me a good edge,
                    and they treated me well, and it was a fun job.</p>

                <p>GOOD: It is a terribly difficult post. It is a post where living was tough. It
                    was very expensive. A bowl of soup in a restaurant was seven dollars and fifty
                    cents.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: So you didn't go out. Your electricity was out regularly on a daily basis
                    at least two, three hours, so we all had those old fashioned generators, not the
                    nice ones they've got now, which were enough to give you a light bulb in the
                    kitchen refrigerator and maybe a little extra, maybe a second one for your
                    freezer. It certainly wasn't going to carry an air conditioner. It wasn't going
                    to carry any more light. You had danger. There was a lot of petty theft. There
                    was a lot of mugging. It was hot, it was humid, it was dirty, and there was a
                    lot of disease. The military was in charge, but Obasanjo was working on
                    maneuvering toward a civilian elected government, so they weren't interested in
                    us either. I took it because of one thing. It was more money, 25 percent. Two, I
                    didn't like being away from my wife 50 percent of the time.</p>

                <p>GOOD: So this was a chance to have a family life regularly. She, of course,
                    didn't have children in Washington, so she was alone. She was, of course, fluent
                    in English, but I'd dumped her into Washington without any network support, and
                    I wasn't there, so I took it for that. I wanted to get out of Washington. I
                    found that I really wasn't interested in the Washington kinds of jobs. In fact,
                    I've never had in my whole career, never really had a line job until I got in
                    the State in October last year when I moved into the IO. I took VOA jobs,
                    negotiating job, which I'll talk about later, so I was happy to get
                    overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I had painted Nigeria so dismally that my wife was prepared for worse than it
                    actually turned out to be. Esprit de corps is quite good in Lagos as is the
                    norm, as you know, in hardship posts, because we're all together in this awful
                    situation, and we're going to make it. There are exceptions; Khartoum was an
                    exception on that. But mostly esprit de corps is measurable in a hardship
                    post.</p>
                <p>Nigeria is a magnificently interesting country! It's teeming with people, it's
                    active, and it's noisy. There are a lot of physical confrontations going.
                    Everyday something happens that you could never have imagined happening. I
                    looked out my window one day. We were stuck in the back building from the old
                    embassy, and through the courtyard from one open gate to the other went this
                    swarm of people chasing this one guy, who was being accused of being a thief. I
                    didn't go out to see what happened to him, but it wasn't unusual for them to
                    beat him thieves to death. They didn't like thieves and pickpockets and they'd
                    go chasing after them.</p>
                <p>It was interesting in an international form; we had money, in the sense that
                    there wasn't any place else to spend your naira. My wife got jobs teaching on
                    the local economy, so we had naira, smelly, dirty, tattered naira, which was the
                    local currency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Naira is what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It's the bill; it's their dollar if you will. At that time it was oh,
                    something like two dollars to a naira, give or take some cents depending on the
                    time. So although we weren't supposed to be trading it when we went outside, it
                    was normal for us to do some exchanging when we left the country to drive over
                    to Benin or to Togo or to Ghana, because it was just too expensive to trade
                    officially in Lagos. Most of our food we brought in from outside because there
                    wasn't a lot available there. But there was a large international community,
                    businessmen involved with oil primarily, but also involved with construction,
                    bringing in engineers and so forth for the building that was taking off with the
                    oil money that had shown up. When I got there, there were something like 180
                    ships anchored in the bay, many of which never got unloaded because people took
                    advantage of this opportunity to put real loser ships that shouldn't been out on
                    the sea anymore, and loading them with something like cement, which would then
                    get wet. They'd sit out there for months and months and ultimately sink. They
                    had some pirates that would occasionally attack the ships and steal things. It
                    was quite a wild time, but a very interesting time and a little bit of an
                    adjustment for the first couple of months. That's normal for us, when we go to
                    the overseas postings, we know the job we're going to get, we've done it before,
                    we have a base to operate from, there's support structure. The unpaid spouse
                    comes in and has to find her own way, every post a new thing, with the exception
                    of those who do pick up a PIT (Part-time Intermittent Temporary) job in the
                    embassy.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Part-time Intermittent Temporary, which now means full-time (laughing)
                    since they changed the regulations. As soon as my wife found her feet, she liked
                    it, too. We didn't have children. We wouldn't take children to Nigeria; it's
                    just too dangerous. There was always at least one foreign child dying every
                    Harmitan season. Harmitan being that season in which the winds from the north
                    bring the sand to the south and bring viral diseases along. The kids are
                    particularly susceptible. Some child in the foreign community is going to
                    die.</p>
                <p>We had four dead bodies wash up on our property. We were on a lagoon; it was
                    connected to the river, which was connected to the bay. I never was there for
                    them. I was either downtown, or I was up on a trip to one of the branches. When
                    those came in, my wife had to deal with it. The most irritating one was when it
                    came up headless. The medical school didn't want that cadaver, and the police
                    didn't know what to do with it, so it took some push from the embassy to get
                    them to take it away. Once I know, they got a pole and pushed the cadaver off to
                    the next property so that (laughing) they didn't have to deal with it.
                    (Laughing) It was quite a time, but it was interesting. The Nigerians, we still
                    enjoy. Wherever we go, we enjoy them, because they are full of life. They may be
                    the most corrupt element in the world today, perhaps not even second to the
                    Russian mafia, but they're challenging.</p>

                <p>GOOD: I was executive officer of the post. We had three branches up country. We
                    had one in Ibadan, we had one in Kano, and we had one in Kaduna. The embassy had
                    a consulate in Kaduna. When I first visited there still was a consulate in
                    Ibadan. Yes, they did. One of the fellows there I had known when I was traveling
                    Chad, the junior officer with State. He wasn't so junior. He had his Ph.D. and
                    had published a book. He was in the mid thirties. The only guy I ever met who
                    took his R and R, and when he came back realized he didn't really want to take a
                    24-month tour and paid back his R and R and left at the end of 18, which was an
                    option in Chad. So I got to visit those posts. I was also responsible for
                    Benin's ADM work as well, just as an excuse to get me out of Nigeria.</p>

                <p>GOOD: It was challenging. Now we did have the regional ADM center, WAAC as they
                    called it, located north of town. But while we could get supplies from there, we
                    weren't able to use all its facilities, as evidenced by the fact that we could
                    not use their metal containers when we packed out. We had to use the wooden
                    containers. When my wooden container arrived at my next post, it looked fine
                    from the street side. But I got around to the other side and there was this huge
                    patch. They had skimmed out everything that was worth anything in that shipment.
                    It was all shaken down to, it had been full; it was shaken down thigh
                    height.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Not even half-full and without boxes, it was just piled in there. All my
                    clothes were gone. Fortunately, I had brought some clothes in the States on home
                    leave, but the port was an open sieve. When I arrived, some of my airfreight
                    didn't make it. I put in my claim, and the company said, “Well, you need to go
                    over to verify that it didn't come in.”I told them, “Please, there's no sense in
                    spending my day getting over there physically and getting back. There's nothing
                    there; it's gone. This is Lagos, folks.” They bought that, finally. When I
                    arrived, it took five hours to get in from the airport, 17 kilometers. 17
                    kilometers! We had to stop halfway along the way because of our air
                    conditioning. They were using it, of course; traffic wasn't moving, and it
                    overheated and had to let it cool down. That's changed; they've got more roads
                    in now.</p>
                <p>It was logistically difficult, it was physically difficult, and it was chaotic.
                    There were policemen with their small whips. You'd see them beating up the
                    drivers of cars all the time, not because anything significant had happened, but
                    because they didn't like what they saw the guy do, or they didn't like his lip
                    or whatever. The drivers weren't upset. They considered this a very normal piece
                    of business in a day.</p>
                <p>A very, very, tough people, but there was more violent death in my two years in
                    Lagos that I personally knew about, our employees or family members, than I have
                    seen anywhere else in my tours, probably in total. Quick death, people went into
                    the hospital and picked up something new and died over a weekend, as was not
                    infrequent. One of our friends was an Egyptian doctor, who had been there for a
                    couple decades and really was a rice merchant by this point, export, import, but
                    he did have some contact with foreigners. He said, “Whatever you do, don't go to
                    a hospital!” That was our medical unit's advice, too. One of our oil guys over
                    in Niger, area of the river district to the east, I think he had a hernia. He
                    needed it operated. He didn't want to leave the area; he was tied into the work.
                    So he said, “Oh, I'll do it over the weekend.” So he went in and he died by
                    Monday. We had a Seabee who died over the weekend in Lagos, same thing. It was
                    dangerous. Don't have your babies born in Lagos, because the hospitals were
                    short of supplies. The supplies they had were probably outdated. There was a lot
                    there to get sick with, because hospitals were where the sickness focused.</p>
                <p>Dead bodies on the streets were not unusual. I remember one announcement in the
                    paper said, “Would anyone seeing a foreigner dead on the streets please notify
                    the authorities.” They didn't care about the Nigerians; they were just concerned
                    about picking up the foreigners. One local doctor got so upset at one point when
                    a body had been left for 30 days on the side of the road that he finally
                    physically, I suppose in a truck, hauled it up to the city hall, and dumped it
                    on the front steps as a protest.</p>

                <p>One of our Washington staff personnel, who later came into the Foreign Service
                    soon after her husband unfortunately had died at post. She had wanted for him to
                    retire before going overseas because it was her first trip abroaNow I don't know
                    who did it to her, but she was on her way to India for TDY, and they routed her
                    through Lagos to see what (laughing) it was like. I took her on my rounds that
                    day. On one of the flyovers, as they call the overpasses there, I noticed a
                    naked male body on the side of the road. My visitor didn't make any mention of
                    it, but I saw she noticed it, and she tensed up, and couldn't stop talking.
                    Fine, I didn't say anything about it. In the evening I took her out to the club,
                    which is one of the real benefits of Lagos, the Ikoyi Club. I'm a squash player,
                    and they had great squash there. Not all the courts had great floors, some of
                    them were concrete, but good players, and it was a perfect way to erase the
                    stress that you had by four o'clock in any Lagos day. So I went over there, and
                    my wife came with me that evening. I played, and they sat having a drink at the
                    table out front, and I came back to the table, and I said, “What are you
                    drinking?” And she said, “Gin, straight gin.”I said, “Why are your feet off the
                    floor?” She was sitting there holding both feet off the floor. She said, “Look
                    at those things running around.” Well, they were lizards.</p>

                    trooper, she learned how to cope, no problem for her, but that was a very, that
                    was what Lagos was to someone coming in, a shocking experience!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your job, did you deal with the government at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Not directly, got close to it in the branch posts, but the branch post
                    officer would be the intermediary there. I wasn't doing reporting, occasionally
                    get involved with leases, but again, that was more often with the owners of the
                    property rather than someone in the government. The government would be setting
                    these ridiculous demands, like you had to pay five years rent in advance. We got
                    away without doing more than two. But at $60,000 a year for a house, that got to
                    be quite a bit of money. It was a very expensive post for our operation! What I
                    found when I got there was that there had been no mandatory increase work done
                    for some years, so they were well under funded in their budget. We had to work
                    hard; Art Lewis was my PAO.With fortunately a very close cooperation of our
                    budget officer in Washington, more than double of our budget my first year by
                    capturing mandatory increases to the budget. If we hadn't had that influx of
                    money, we'd have been in really very serious trouble.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Q: What was your impression? I mean you've been around the block a number of
                    times. Were we getting to the right people, and did it make any difference as
                    far as you know, the USIA, the Americans' story?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, in Nigeria, a very definite success story. They weren't interested in
                    us particularly. In fact, they were probably less interested in the American
                    embassy than any place I've been. They were so focused, those opinion makers in
                    Lagos, were so focused on this conversion to nonmilitary government, that they
                    were very interested in our assistance in learning how to have a constitutional
                    government. They were interested in bringing in parts of our system, as opposed
                    to bringing the British system in lock, stock, and barrel. We had many, many
                    exchange visits, getting prospective legislators, constitution writers, and so
                    forth to the States to observe and learn how our system worked. So we had
                    tremendous impact on the development of the civilian government.</p>
                <p>But they were really focused on their affairs. If you invited someone to dinner,
                    cocktail party, whatever, you didn't know who would come, and you didn't know
                    when they'd come. You had to assume that some would come, and some would come
                    very late. Some would bring a wife, some had to bring a second wife, some had to
                    bring a mistress. It's a man's world there of course. You didn't have that much
                    contact with women because the women were not the people that you were going to
                    be dealing with anyway.</p>
                <p>Yes, we had an excellent ambassador, Don Easum, who was a pro, analthough he
                    didn't appreciate my beating him at squash, he was okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He came one night. I had just finished an hour of squash and was having a
                    beer, and he dropped by at the club and said, “How about giving me some
                    exercise?” He had been a good squash player, but of course, I had 10 years on
                    him. So we rented a court, and we played, and I whipped him fairly easily even
                    though I had just spent an hour on the court before. He never again asked to
                    play. (Laughing)</p>
                <p>But he was very good. He had his Ph.D.; he had a long experience in Africa. He
                    had been an area director, a regional director at State. But he got into some
                    trouble and didn't go on to another ambassadorship. His ADM officers didn't
                    agree with what he wanted done in some cases. They thought that he was misusing
                    government funds, not for personal perks, but for activities or enhancements
                    that weren't legitimate. They were prepared to go to the Hill (Capitol Hill)
                    should he come up for confirmation. So he opted out, which was a loss to the
                    service, to take over the Afro-American operation in New York.</p>

                <p>GOOD: I left in June of '77. Making use of our excess naira, we bought round the

                    the naira and then got reimbursed later. It turned out we got reimbursed about
                    $10,000 I think by the time we got to post. Now of course the next post had
                    inexperienced ADM officers, junior officers without any supervision
                    particularly. It took me a year to get my voucher processed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I went to Surinam. I got there in September, and I'll get tthat.</p>
                <p>So we went east instead of west from Lagos and flew into Nairobi about three
                    o'clock in the morning. An old friend of mine met me and looked at me with
                    rather strangely and said, “Are you really going to the County Hotel?” I said,
                    “Yes.” “Oh,” he said, “I can't believe that.”He was off on a truck safari at
                    five o'clock, so I didn't see him again. County Hotel was overlooking the main
                    park. We got the penthouse, the top floor, all for us. It was a dump of course.
                    The beds weren't good, but lots of beds, and a great view, and fine privacy, and
                    the management was great, Chinese run, the food was good, but it wasn't the
                    Hilton. I had been there, of course, before, and I didn't like the Hilton.
                    Hilton was like this thing here in Tyson's Corner, round. I didn't like the
                    Intercontinental, and I didn't like, what was the old one that closed, the
                    Nairobi, which was the old plantation owner's place. So we tried it, and my wife
                    survived it. She wasn't excited about it. She hasn't forgiven me yet.</p>
                <p>We took a short safari in a little Toyota with a guide. We got stuck crossing a
                    streambed. The guide didn't know how to drive very well, so I had to get out and
                    rock the thing out while the lions were watching us. It was a little bit
                    hectic.</p>
                <p>Then we flew on to Sri Lanka and Singapore, and Penang. We were going take the
                    train up the Kra Peninsula, but within the first couple of hours my wife, who
                    didn't have glasses on, got hit in the eye, so we had to fly out of Songkhla to
                    Bangkok and have it treated.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Earlier in Sri Lanka we ran into a serious problem, because we had bought our
                    tickets in naira, non-exchangeable naira. The DC-10s were taken out of service
                    after we'd started. The only flight from Nairobi to Sri Lanka directly, which we
                    had been scheduled to take, it was going through the Seychelles, which is the
                    other country I didn't get to, was a DC-10, and they weren't flying. So we
                    managed to get a diversion up to Pakistan and then down. That was okay, but we
                    didn't have that option from Sri Lanka. We would've had to buy a new ticket.
                    Fortunately they allowed the DC-10s up again. This was just after the door blew
                    off out of Detroit.</p>

                <p>Q: The day I was flying a DC-10, I think, I can't remember where I was coming
                    back from, someplace, and I was going to Houston, Texas, and I was booked on a
                    DC-10. We were watching television pictures showing this plane crashing, you
                    know?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, yes, that must have been about the same time. It was, but it opened
                    up, and we were okay. We got to Sri Lanka, and my wife loved it. We got up to
                    Kandy, and we went to Galle Face. I'd been there before, of course, out of
                    Thailand. We'd done R and R over to Sri Lanka and up into Calcutta. On this
                    trip, actually we went Karachi, Bombay, Madras, Colombo, but didn't spend any
                    time in Bombay, just had to work hard to get an outward flight. It's about the
                    only time I've ever used my diplomat passport to get some priority. She liked
                    Madras; I liked Madras. I liked Bangalore; I like India, parts of it at least.
                    It can be trouble, but I'll get to that later, because I did travel India later.
                    She liked Bangkok, although she says, she went back last year on TDY, “It's like
                    New York in the tropics now with the new buildings built up.”</p>
                <p>Then we went on to Taiwan where my brother was a missionary at the time, and then
                    up Osaka, took the train up to Tokyo and flew across to the States, bought a car
                    in Los Angeles, drove up to the Northwest, and then across Canada, and down
                    through New York to Washington, where I took two weeks of Berlitz Dutch on my
                    way to Surinam.</p>

                        Equinotoday at one o'clock. Paul, let's start.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You are in Surinam from 1979 to '81. What was your job? Then let'talk about the
                    situation in Surinam at this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>GOOD: Okay. I was a public affairs officer, the only USIS officer at post. We had
                    a separate building in which we had a library, a reading room really and a press
                    operation. We had media contacts. We worked with the university. The embassy was
                    down the street and it's the first time in my, I guess the only time in my
                    career, in which we pulled the embassy to our building ultimately. At the time I
                    left, we had signed a lease to move the embassy to our building. They were going
                    to put the consulate on the ground floor. We were on the second floor already
                    because the landlord had over strengthened his building, far more than the
                    regulations called for, so that it meant the top floor was easily strong enough
                    to take the heavy communications equipment.</p>
                <p>Surinam had a very strange situation. It was sort of a dead zone for
                    communications. It had difficulty in transmitting radio messages. When the coup
                    came, as I'll talk about in a minute, Washington couldn't communicate with us.
                    They were quite upset, not that they were usually interested in communicating
                    with us. But since there was a coup, they thought perhaps they should, and
                    perhaps they were right, but I must say that not having them communicating was
                    made a lot easier during the coup, (chucking) since they couldn't interfere.</p>
                <p>We had a small embassy, which increased while I was there because of the coup and
                    the resulting questionable relationships with Cuba through Grenada. Nancy
                    Ostrander was the ambassador when I got there. She was supported by a DCM, a
                    communications officer, an ADM officer, and three young officers on first tours,
                    basically. They had some training, but they were on their first tour, so they
                    had a consul and a couple, one of the early tandem Assignments.</p>
                <p>Q: The DCM must have been basically jack-of-all-trades?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, political and economic officer and DCM. He was under some stress,
                    partly, I suspect, because he had some difficulty working with Nancy. I don't
                    know whether there was a gender problem there or not. He was finishing up or had
                    finished up a divorce. His wife was an heiress, and the kids had been settled
                    with huge trust accounts, and none of those were there at post with him, so he
                    wasn't always lucid. But when he was in a good mood, you couldn't ask for a
                    politer, gentleman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Nuel Pazdral. I think he'd spent more of his time in EasterEurope. Poland
                    was one of his strong interests.</p>
                <p>

                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I knew a Pazdral. Yes, I know Nuel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, last I heard he was in Bucharest, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I'm not sure what happened to him after that; it's been somtime. He was a
                    real gentleman when he wasn't upset.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But we had some problems, because he wanted, partly because he wasn't as
                    you say jack-of-all-trades there, he wanted to vet everything that I did.
                    Obviously, when it came to media reporting, our job is to get the stuff back to
                    Washington as quickly as possible. We don't have time to wait around for
                    vettings. The ambassador didn't want to get into the middle of it. She said,
                    “Settle it yourself.” So I did, I ignored him, took my messages directly to CPU.
                    But there was a political situation, which I think was beyond Nancy's
                    comprehension. Now partly it's because she didn't have a great deal of
                    experience in South America, but partly it was because she felt that she wanted
                    to deal, and therefore, we should trust the information that she was getting
                    from the highest sources. One of her main sources was Henk Arron, who the head
                    of the legislature. Unfortunately there had been a problem with the operation,
                    and they were at a stalemate, had been in stalemate for some months before I
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might have talked about the general situation in
                        Surinam athat time - its composition, its economy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Surinam had been Dutch Guiana, of course, and received its independence in
                    1975. It had been traditionally a very poor colony for Holland. It had been
                    useful historically because it did have a safe port; the Paramaribo River had
                    easy sailing for some distance up the channel, and so the city itself was some
                    miles from the sea.</p>
                <p>Basically between the sea and the city were mangrove swamps, so it wasn't as if
                    you were in highlands and so forth. The mosquito problem, malaria had been
                    pretty well wiped out by Rockefeller when he came in in the '30s to do a good
                    deed. By 1979 malaria was because they haven't been able to maintain the
                    spraying.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Before World War II, they had discovered aluminum ore. It had become
                    strategically important during World War II, not only for aluminum, but because
                    it was one of the landing fields needed to ferry planes from the United States
                    to Africa and the Middle East. The planes couldn't take long hops, and it was
                    too dangerous to go across the North Atlantic. They had the longest airfield in
                    South America put into Paramaribo to allow them to take off with heavy loads of
                    gas. They went from the U.S. to Jamaica to Paramaribo to Recife across to Dakar,
                    Sierra Leone, Kano, Cairo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sierra Leone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, hopping across. It was important for the war effort to keep the
                    channel open to be able to get the ore out. There were no railroads, and it was
                    not a difficult channel to block if they could get their ships in, and they
                    tried. The Germans had a ship in there that they scuttled trying to block it.
                    It's still there, but they didn't succeed in completely blocking the
                    channel.</p>
                <p>But come independence, they hadn't really left much of that wealth locally. They
                    were well educated. They had probably on a per capita basis, the highest level
                    of education of any country around, not that there were that many people of
                    course, but with independence about 150,000 of their half million people or so,
                    left.</p>
                <p>When I got there, they were down to about 350,000 and quite dependent upon
                    Holland for the “golden handshake,” which was still being paid out. With the
                    coup which came, the handshake was put in escrow, and they're talking about
                    meeting the final payments now, but the situation, and this is 2000, is still a
                    bit too uncertain for them to be sure how to do it. But they'd like to get it
                    over with so they can clean their books. But at that time the problem was
                    internal with the Indians, the Hindustani as they called them, and the Creoles,
                    which were a mix of mostly Creoles, but some Bush Negroes, those who were
                    descendants of the slaves who had immediately escaped into the bush. I must tell
                    you that the bush began 15 kilometers outside of town, so it didn't take long to
                    get to the bush.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Now the composite of the country is not like Guyana. It isn't about 50-50
                    Hindustani-Creole. It's about 30 percent Creoles, 7 or 8 percent Bush Negro,
                    about 33 or 34 percent Hindustani, about one percent Asian, mostly Chinese, the
                    leftovers from the early 1800s when they were brought in as indentured servants.
                    There were Javanese, about 17 percent who came in between World War I and 1939.
                    And the whites, mostly Dutch, who had come as early as the 1830s and stayed,
                    small farmers, not well educated, but industrious. With the exception of the
                    Javanese and the Chinese, there hadn't been much mixing between the races as far
                    as marriage was concerned. There were also some American Indians. There were
                    Jews, both Sephardic and Ashkenazim. They had come in originally via the
                    circular route, if you will, from Spain in 1492 to Holland, to Brazil, which at
                    that time was under the control of the Dutch because the Portuguese had turned
                    their attention to Spain when the royal houses joined, 1580 to 1640 I think it
                    was, and had then, after being kicked out when the Portuguese, came back, moved
                    up the coast. Some stayed, some went on to Rhode Island and Barbados and Curacao
                    and even Cartegena.</p>
                <p>The Ashkenazim came over fleeing the Nazi regime in Germany. They had, and still
                    do have, or at least did when I was there, two active synagogues, not so active
                    that they could fill both of them every Saturday, Friday night, but enough so
                    that they would shift from one Sabbath in one to the next Sabbath in the other.
                    They stayed out of politics though. They were very much involved in
                    business.</p>
                <p>The chief businessman there, whose daughter just got married this last weekend in
                    the Hamptons, Lee Iacocca, was there at the ceremony, had the Coca-Cola
                    franchise. He also had the Pepsi franchise so that nobody could get compete with
                    his Coke. He had the bakery. He had the reconstituted milk. He had some car
                    agencies, a lot of export import in general. His father had been the chauffeur
                    for the general in charge of the airport and the troops that we had there during
                    World War II. I guess the payoff was that he met and he worked in the deal where
                    he got the franchise for the country.</p>
                <p>But to get back to what the situation was when I arrived, after several months of
                    stalemate, that is that nobody had the majority in the legislature, the fight
                    was whether or not anything that had been decided on was valid. Nothing was
                    happening as a result. Henk Arron was the speaker, a friend of Nancy's, or so
                    she thought, and perhaps he was, I don't know. There was a president as well,
                    but he was not involved in the day-to-day affairs. He sort of floated above it
                    all, a very nice fellow, and one time told me that the reason they had to have
                    these political shenanigans was that there wasn't anything else happening in
                    Surinam. They didn't get hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes. What else could
                    they get? So they had to make their own. He was forced out later. When I tried
                    to report this as the scenario in my country plan back to Washington, Nancy
                    wouldn't let it go. She said, “This is going to work itself out; it's not going
                    to be a problem.”</p>

                <p>GOOD: My sources were telling me that the situation was unstable, that you
                    couldn't have this stalemate for much longer. It had already been going on for
                    months. I know my predecessor felt the same way, but she and the ambassador had
                    not been speaking, which is one of the reasons they hurried me down there. They
                    literally weren't talking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this another ambassador and another?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: With my predecessor, the PAO. She was very well connected, but of course
                    she wasn't getting her message across. I was unable to get it out, except orally
                    to anyone who might come by from the agency.</p>
                <p>Q: Speaking of the agency, what about the CIA? Did they have a presence there,
                    and if they did, what were they getting?GOOD: They didn't have anyone at post.
                    They had TDYers on occasion, coming up from Brazil.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this wasn't very high on anybody's priority list?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Not yet. It wasn't until the coup and the subsequent flirtations with the
                    Cubans and then the Libyans that they began to get some attention. I suspect
                    that that's what did in Nancy's successor, John J. Crowley, Jr., who'd come down
                    from being DCM in Venezuela, very good guy, very savvy, but he wasn't felt to be
                    strong enough in denouncing and working to undermine or break the building
                    relations that the new government in Surinam after the coup was developing.
                    There were some Middle Easterners in Surinam, not many, but there was a mosque,
                    at that time. I remember seeing at the airport on occasion when the various
                    flights would come in, a coterie of a few dressed in the Middle Eastern outfit.
                    It became larger later on, but I don't have direct knowledge of that.</p>
                <p>Q: At the time, when this situation was building up, did we, were you in any way,
                    or anyone seeing the hand of the Cubans or Libyans there, or did this develop
                    later after the coup?</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>GOOD: In my opinion it developed later, but there was a propensity for it on the
                    part of Desi Bouterse, who became the leader of the junta after the coup,
                    because he had to look for someplace, as is the want of people who have been
                    turned off by the major players in politics in the world. He had to go
                    someplace, and he was a ripe candidate for being solicited by the Cubans and the
                    Libyans in this way. There wasn't then any active organization looking to
                    overthrow the government.</p>
                <p>The problem was that the government was fragile. A little push for whatever
                    reason turned out to be enough to knock it down. The little push came from a
                    strange side. At the time of independence, the army, according to the Surinamese
                    soldiers, had been promised a labor union by the Dutch. This was 1979, '80 by
                    the time the coup came, five years after independence they didn't have their
                    union. So a rough group of the Surinamese, basically because the Dutch had not
                    had any officers, like with Idi Amin in Uganda, they had to get somebody up.
                    They took their most senior NCO, although no one suggested that he was capable
                    of being an officer. They had to make him one. He's now, well at the time of the
                    coup he made himself a colonel I guess, Desi Bouterse, Desi and his men didn't
                    see eye to eye, got together in the lunch room at the base, and in effect, went
                    on sort of a hunger strike, or at least a sit-down in demand for their union.
                    They wanted to be able to negotiate probably a little more money, whatever, and
                    nothing happened because the government was not in a strong enough position to
                    do anything. They didn't have anybody really in charge to be able to do that.
                    They wanted to, but that didn't make any difference to the soldiers. They wanted
                    some action. So about seven days after they sat down in their dining room,
                    (chuckling) they decided to make a move. At night a group of them went out and
                    blew up some ammunition at the armory and went down and took over the fort. It
                    was a fort, and not a badly built fort, but it's not something that you couldn't
                    have pretty well demolished if you'd had any other forces around. Of course the
                    government didn't have any other forces. Henk Arron just lost his cool and fled.
                    I don't know where he fled, I don't think he left the country at that point, but
                    he disappeared. So there was nobody in charge, and by default, this military
                    group found themselves in charge of the country. So they had to quickly figure
                    out how to reorganize themselves and to this new responsibility.</p>
                <p>From the embassy point of view, it was sort of embarrassing. We had been using
                    Paramaribo as a refueling point for the long distance flights that would go out
                    to the Azores to pick up the drops from the satellites. They would refuel in
                    Suriname, fly out to pick up the stuff, refuel in the Azores, and then come
                    back.</p>

                    They were overnighting the night of the coup. So, of course, the easy assumption
                    that was made by some is that we had organized this. Well, all we were really
                    trying to do at that point was to get those guys out. There were 30 some of them
                    in the group, and we had to get authorization from the military, since they were
                    in charge, to give us freedom to take them out. Some of them were out at the
                    field already, but the officers were in town at the hotel, and we needed to get
                    authority to take them by car out to the airport and get them out, which we
                    did.</p>
                <p>Nancy had to be kept safe, and for some reason at the time of the coup, she was
                    at the residence, and I was assigned. There seems to be some rule that says that
                    the ambassador has to be chaperoned by some officer from the embassy, and I was
                    designated to be that person. So we did some telephoning from there, and some
                    car traffic came back and forth. Nancy's inaccurate account of this day is what
                    prompted my getting in touch with your office.</p>
                <p>My wife was a little upset that she was frozen out of communication over at the
                    house. I didn't get through to her. It turns out that, of course, these guys
                    downtown were shooting into the air. 50 caliber machine gun bullets have to come
                    down once they've gone up, and one of them came down into our house roof, which
                    was tin, and it came through the roof, and bounced on the bathroom floor where
                    my wife was brushing her teeth, and hit her in the leg. Fortunately by the time
                    it got to that point it wasn't strong enough in force to break the skin, but it
                    was a hairy experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But we survived. Because of course the army guys knew that we were not
                    involved, they weren't after our hides. We got our people out. They never came
                    back by the way. They were diverted over to Cayenne. When they found that the
                    girls at the hotel were topless, they never bothered to come back to Paramaribo
                    or try to get authorization to come back. So I never saw them again.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>Of course the coup leaders and everybody else in any leadership role in the
                    community was focused on getting things back in order. The ultimate result was
                    that the Dutch pulled back their aid. The Dutch colonel in charge of their
                    military effort was a liaison who was living next door to me. We put a gate in
                    our common side fence so that we could go back and forth, socialize during the
                    coup, which was on for quite a bit of time. I spent a lot of time under coup
                    conditions in South America, both Chile and in Surinam. We didn't have it in
                    Colombia, but sometimes it seemed like we did. But in any event, they had pretty
                    well cut back their support, and it was under military conditions.</p>
                <p>They had a series of coups for one reason or another as they jockeyed for
                    permanent position, a total of five. The end result was that they end up with no
                    legislature, and no president, just a junta made up of a group of sergeants who
                    had gotten together and then moved themselves up. The sergeants were a mixed
                    breed. One of the most active ones actually was of Hindustani extraction, not
                    pure, but pretty close, and the Desi tended to be more Creole. The language that
                    they used, they were most comfortable with, was Taki-Taki, which is a patois
                    with a Dutch-English base. Desi was a pretty good stump speaker. He would
                    harangue the crowds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Taki-Takis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, Boutarse was not well educated. He preferred thSurinamese spoken by
                    the masses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, his first name is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Desi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Desi Bouterse, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Desi Bouterse was the spokesman. He's still around. He's under trial, I
                    believe, in absentia in Holland for something right now. Suriname got involved
                    with drugs, probably still is, as a transit point, Desi still has significant
                    political power, because he's got this voting block.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Of course, the way they handled and have handled their legislature there is on
                    the basis of, which is not uncommon around the world, proportional
                    representation. Each block sets set up a list of people who are running on their
                    ticket. Depending upon how well they do in the election, they will get some or
                    more of that group into legislature. It's done by popularity, and the list is
                    set up one, two, three, four, five, six, so that if they win enough votes for
                    one, the first on the list certainly gets in. If they get more than that, it's
                    two and three, and it's dependent on how far down the list you get before they
                    cut it. It isn't a one-man, one-vote kind of a situation. So with the coup which
                    went on, I don't know how, it seemed to me they cut it back, but it seems to me
                    that it stuck around for the rest of my time there, which was another year and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>Q: When the coup first happened, were there overtures that you were aware of to
                    the American embassy for help to do something from either side?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no. What could we do?</p>
                <p>Q: Well, no, but I mean sometimes you get this even though maybe, you know, we're
                    saying, “Gee we can't do anything.” But you have people who, you know, we're a
                    super, big, major power, and there you are, and I would think that somebody
                    would come running to you and say, “Do something,” or “Help me,” or “Do this or
                    that.”</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, let me set a little bit more of a scene. Surinam is isolated, very
                    isolated. It wasn't receiving television signals from anyplace else. You could
                    get some radio, but it was at sort of a dead zone. You don't get a lot of that
                    either. By the nature of the Caribbean communications, the information that they
                    get by short wave is from their home mother country, whatever it may be, is only
                    about the mother country and whatever little news might be coming out of that
                    colony. The only cross information was coming from a 10-minute news broadcast to
                    the Caribbean from Voice of America, which would include in those 10-minutes
                    bits of news from across the spectrum of former colonies in the Caribbean and
                    northern South America. These people had been educated in Holland, to the extent
                    that they were educated. Outside the country they didn't know. Some of the
                    younger ones, children, were beginning to go to the States for college when I
                    got there. They had no idea what our system was, so our degree wasn't
                    recognized. They didn't know where to fit us into the salary scale, the newly
                    returned graduates. They were focused on Holland, and that was it as far as
                    outside relations. Yes, they knew about Brazil, but Brazil didn't really
                    care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, of course you're USIA, and I mean information
                        service.Let's say prior, when you arrived there, what had USIA been
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>GOOD: We fed the wireless file to selected people, opinion makers. We got it to
                    the television station, the radio stations, and so forth so that the people who
                    were making decisions knew we existed, and they had some general idea what was
                    going on in the world. But their visceral instincts were still their
                    relationships between the Netherlands and themselves and trying to negotiate
                    some kind of balance within the country. When you have no majority and the
                    partiality is not dominant, you've got a lot of internal negotiating to do.</p>
                <p>I remember meeting some Surinamese on a train in Holland one time. Once they got
                    out of the country, they realized that they had far more in common with their
                    opponent, let's say in Surinam, when they were outside the country, than they
                    did with anybody else. They realized they really were Surinamese. They might
                    disagree with the Hindustani, if they were Creole and so forth, but they
                    understood each other far more than anybody else understood them. Across the
                    board they were hungry for anything we could tell them about what was going on
                    in Suriname.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Dutch during this, as this thing developed?
                        Wathere a Dutch...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: There was an ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An ambassador? I would have thought...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But there was no public information person, and this reallshowed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, there was no tradition for it. I think that we were the only embassy
                    that had anyone involved with information. So the ambassador attempted to serve
                    as spokesman. He did a bum job of it because he had no experience. He was being
                    forced into public positions where his experience had only been in in-house or
                    behind-the-scenes negotiation. He would say things that he really didn't mean or
                    could be taken the wrong way. It didn't work out. They needed to have someone
                    there who could be a buffer.</p>
                <p>Q: They weren't having somebody, in other words, the Dutch ambassador was not
                    saying, “We are for democracy, and if you have this, your aid will be cut off,”
                    and that sort of thing?</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>GOOD: He might have made some threats about the aid, but he was perceived and
                    probably he still had a habit of thinking of himself as being the big guy coming
                    back to sort of “look at this former child of ours, Surinam.” There wasn't
                    really the feeling that, certainly not, that the military sergeants were his
                    equal. Now the president was a sophisticated guy, and Henk Arron wasn't bad, but
                    these other guys were just not classy guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the thing develop? What were you doing? The
                        soldiercame and took over the fort, and then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It turned out then that there wasn't anybody else who was in charge. Henk
                    Arron had disappeared, the legislature sort of dissolved of its own, and the
                    president, by the nature of the presidency and the nature of the personality of
                    the president, was not in a position to step in and take charge. If he had been
                    a strong leader, he could have stepped in and resolved the situation on that
                    morning because these guys, all they wanted was their union. They had not done
                    this to be saddled with running the country. They didn't know how to run the
                    country. They weren't economists. They knew that they weren't considered the
                    equals of the Dutch in the negotiating situation. It was a downer for them, and
                    of course, it turned out to be a downer.The country has just not survived well
                    at all. It's obviously still there, and they still are shipping out the aluminum
                    ore, but projects such as the one that we were involved with over on the west
                    side of the country died. The border river between Guyana and Surinam had been
                    used as an opening to get to some other ore. We had the contract, built the
                    railroad to get from the river to the mine, and had been involved in building up
                    a new village, but nobody wanted to live there. They had done a bad job of
                    building support locally. They didn't have a psychologist on the committee who
                    was setting this thing up. So when it came down to the time to get people to
                    permanently settle over there, they gave them houses, they gave them all kinds
                    of benefits, but there wasn't any party life. So the whole project sort of died,
                    because the coup came along, and certainly there wasn't anybody in the new
                    government who understood what the situation was and being interested in pushing
                    it. The last I heard, the village was deserted, and there wasn't anything coming
                    out of the mine.</p>
                <p>The railroad's still there, the best railroad in the country. There were only
                    two. The other one ran slowly from Paramaribo up to the dam. I put one of my
                    sons on there one day to give him something to do while he was visiting, and he
                    said it was awful. He said it was just terrible. There was a drunk on the train,
                    it didn't go anywhere, it stopped, and there was nothing to do when you finally
                    did achieve the dam. Going through the jungle was ugh.</p>
                <p>There weren't many roads. There was one road across the country. It went from
                    Nieuw Nickerie, which is on the border with Guyana on the river, which is the
                    border with Guyana. And there was another one across from Saint-Laurent, which
                    is the first city on the French Guiana side.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>You had to take a ferry for a couple of the crossings, and there were a couple of
                    bridges, because Surinam is one series of rivers that run from the interior to
                    the ocean. Because there were no roads that penetrated the interior, the one
                    crossroad meant it had to either have a ferry or it had to have a bridge. You
                    couldn't get to French Guiana or Guyana without using ferry. While the one to
                    French Guiana was an okay car ferry, the one to Guyana was for foot traffic. One
                    small could be put on the roof. The Nieuw Nickerie, Surinam location was not
                    directly across the river from the Guyana border post. So you first went out
                    towards sea, not all the way, and then back inland on another river quite a
                    ways. I think it was about a four-hour trip to get across. I did it one time.
                    The consul and I decided to take a long weekend. We got over there; we got a
                    taxi and made our way into Georgetown, the capital of Guyana, and loved it. Now
                    it didn't take too much to bring variety.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it seem like the big city there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Absolutely. Now the city itself is below sea level, the downtown area.
                    They've got a dike up there. But they had squash courts, which to me is a sign
                    of civilization. It was well laid out. The streets were broader. It had some
                    lovely architecture, not being too well maintained, but a lot of wooden
                    architecture, which drove our security people crazy because, of course, there
                    wasn't anyplace that they could get a really fireproof building. Their
                    legislature was quite good looking. They had a national park. They had manitees
                    in the gardens, in their ponds.</p>
                <p>They had problems economically there. It was difficult to get food. Canned food
                    was illegal. If you had a can with food, you had to open it in your house with
                    the shades down and a flashlight. You couldn't throw the can away; you had to
                    bury it so they wouldn't find you had it. I got this story from the Guyana's
                    ambassador to Surinam who took some cans back with him. He said it was a real
                    secret process to be able to enjoy it. We went into the grocery stores, and
                    maybe there would be a scrawny chicken or two, but there wasn't much else
                    available. They thought that Paramaribo was heaven on earth. It wasn't too long
                    after that before they both thought that the only place to go was Cayenne, over
                    in French Guiana.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any, was the geography such that Brazil didn't
                        play any part in it, because it does have a border with Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But there was no land communication. There is a road, which is navigable
                    most of the year by four-wheel drive, in Guyana that runs south to Brazil. But
                    in Surinam there was nothing. They worried about Brazil a little bit. They
                    weren't uncomfortable with them personally, because Brazilians that they'd met
                    were mixed, and they were dealing on a business basis, and their political
                    association was with the Netherlands. They had no real association politically
                    on a decent basis in South America.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>They were having border fights with the French over the border with French
                    Guiana. That led later almost to an armed conflict. The French had a French
                    Foreign Legion post in San Laurent just across the river from Surinam, which was
                    sort of senile. I went over to take a look at it one day (chuckling). Nice guys,
                    but it was the pits. A couple of them had retired in town. One had married, he
                    had opened a little restaurant, and on the side he sold mounted butterflies in
                    plastic. I still have a beautiful blue one hanging on my wall at the house. He
                    was very pleasant, had a little daughter, I don't know whether he had a wife
                    around still or not. There was also an old prison falling down. You could still
                    go in and see the shackles.</p>
                <p>From San Laurent an hour or so, you got you blast off site for the Ariane
                    rockets, very modern. In fact, the way that they moved the missile from its
                    setup point to the launch pad went right across the highway. When they were
                    having it shot, they closed the highway, and you couldn't go on to Cayenne. The
                    police were also firm about using seat belts...</p>
                <p>Q: So the soldiers started taking over the government? Anybody coming? I mean
                    what were we doing, just sitting there watching this, or were we?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, yes we had no axe to grind on this one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean what was our fee? Normally, you know, we're
                        pushindemocracy and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We weren't pushing democracy as actively then, as we were later. We were
                    pushing human rights. This was Carter. Remember the disastrous Carter years
                    where you didn't want to wake up in the morning because you didn't know what
                    policy change had been made while you were asleep.</p>
                <p>Q: Now often when you get a coup of this nature, in the first place, I assume
                    because these were essentially sergeants in the army, you know, that we probably
                    didn't have much in the way or anytime knowing these people before hand or
                    not?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, I did have an indirect information source. My chief local employee
                    was a classmate of Bouterse, a grade school schoolmate. Now he wasn't a close
                    relationship because there had been some kind of a fight over a woman some
                    period before that, and so Ronny was sort of worried about his long term
                    (laughing), physical well being. He left the country not too long after I did
                    and moved to Curacao, last I heard.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>It was a very small place. These guys had been drinking buddies; they grew up
                    together, rode bicycles together, which of course was the main means of
                    transportation up until independence. People didn't have money. They were poor.
                    This assistant of mine had gotten himself a high school education, I guess, and
                    had gone into journalism, which is where we picked him up. Bouterse didn't even
                    have that much education. There was one good high school in town, but with
                    independence, the source of teachers disappeared. They'd been mostly Dutch. The
                    grade schools weren't well staffed by the time I got there, so that the
                    graduates weren't qualified to really go on to a reasonably tough high school
                    that they had. The traditional, not quite gymnasium, but of that nature, heavily
                    academic, definitely teacher dominated school. The student didn't learn to ask
                    questions, but by the time they'd finished their one high school, they could be
                    well prepared. One of them I remember went up to Dade County and went to the
                    Dade County College and just was embarrassed at how backward it was. He was far
                    more advanced than the community college curriculum was prepared to provide him.
                    But of course, that was like going from a prep school back to a community
                    college here. You just had more of a start than your competitors.</p>
                <p>We did have, or I had, some information. You could pick up some indirectly from
                    the Dutch, and as I said, the colonel in charge of their relations with the
                    military was next door. His opinion of Bouterse was very low. His opinion of all
                    of the Surinamese soldiers was, as a colonel would have toward the non-officer
                    class of any developing country, I suspect. The British feeling toward Idi Amin
                    is another illustration of that. So I could get information about what was going
                    on in the military this route, but from the Dutch side you had it filtered a bit
                    because it was anti all the way. From Ronny's side it was more gossip because he
                    also wasn't involved in the policy level to the extent there was a policy
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your perspective, how did the takeover work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We're talking about almost a small town. There was no opposition. These
                    guys, well they had the guns. The Dutch weren't going to come in. All they were
                    prepared to do was to cut off the aid. The businessmen in town, like my friend
                    Jack, were interested in making sure that the communication lines continued so
                    they could get their stuff out and get their stuff in. So they were looking to
                    maintain relationships on a commercial basis. Of course, the soldiers had no
                    objections to that and the businessmen had basically gone to school with these
                    guys too. It wasn't as if you had to go through several layers to get to the
                    people who were making the decisions. The problem was that you had a number of
                    people in the junta, and they quarreled within their own group. You had to get a
                    number of people putting pressure on the number of people in the junta to get
                    them to see that this is the correct way to go on this decision. “It's not going
                    to hurt you, in fact it's going to help you, and it's certainly a help for us
                    because if it helps us, it'll help the country.” Shortly after I left, and I
                    left in... When did I leave?</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left in '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I left in '81, just trying to think what month. I guess I left in June, and
                    I was going, wait a minute. Where was I going from there? I was going to Chinese
                    language training, in August. Yes, I left in late June, for Colombia.</p>
                <p>Sometime in the fall of '81, they had a purge and killed a number of leaders
                    including the union lawyer who was living behind me. That put a shuddering halt
                    to a lot of the civility between groups. Others, such as the vice chancellor of
                    the university, who'd been one of our grantees, a very qualified lady, left with
                    her husband. Her husband was also well educated, but he had a closer
                    relationship with the guys in the junta. He came back before she did. She went
                    up to Gainesville, Florida, and then she ultimately went back too. After I had
                    left, and she had left, I had some correspondence with her, but it cut off when
                    I suggested that there was perhaps a bit of a problem with the democratic
                    process in Surinam. She got huffy about that. It was the last I've heard from
                    her, because obviously there was a problem. I guess I wasn't very tactful in
                    suggesting that democracy had failed. She probably took it a little bit
                    personally in thinking that I thought that the educated group had failed to
                    sustain its responsibility in keeping control of the process so that it didn't
                    go off the track as it obviously had and is obviously still off 20 years
                    later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The coup was in January of '80, the first coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had about a year and a half with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our concerns? How did they develop?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>GOOD: The immediate concerns were to get communications up with Washington, very
                    small potatoes stuff, but that was important. They wanted to know from our point
                    of view what was going on. Then, because it was the Dutch area of influence and
                    because they really had no dealings with the rest of South America, the Monroe
                    Doctrine wasn't a real problem. So we backed off and let it go its own merry way
                    for a while. We didn't get interested again until Desi began to play footsy with
                    Cuba. Apparently they had had some contact with Grenada, Gre-nay-da as they
                    pronounce it in the Caribbean, and they had some mutual visits back and forth.
                    At that point, Washington began to get a little more interested. That's about
                    the time that Nancy was pulled out. I think she'd done her two years. Jack came
                    in. He, then, was thought, as I understood later, to be less than forceful in
                    his denunciation of these contacts and about what alternatives they had and what
                    would happen if they didn't make use of these alternatives. Then that got
                    complicated when the Libyan influence began to arrive. It may have been more
                    than just Libyan, but the idea that there were the Middle Easterners interested
                    Washington. There are lots of Middle Easterners in that area. Venezuela has
                    about 100,000 Syrians for example and there is a mosque, and there is a mosque
                    in San Andres, the Colombian island that I enjoy visiting.</p>
                <p>To get down to a little bit farther ahead, something the Moroccans, for example,
                    find very difficult to believe, is that a non-Muslim can go into a mosque. I was
                    very happy to remind them, or tell them, because they didn't believe it at
                    first, that I had gone into mosques all over the world. The fact that I couldn't
                    go into the mosque in Morocco was not because of the Muslim religious tenants.
                    It was because of the French policy decision when they took over the
                    protectorate. They wanted to leave one place at least where the Moroccans could
                    be Moroccans without fear of foreign influence.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But there were mosques, and there are lots of MiddlEasterners or
                    networking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see, were there manifestations of Cuban or
                        Libyainfluence at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, not noticeably in the country. They didn't have people coming in and
                    being stationed there that I could see, but it was at that point that we began
                    to get some TDYs. DIA sent one in. CIA sent one in to begin to try to get a
                    little bit more information.</p>
                <p>Q: Now I remember, I can't remember who it was, the ambassador that I interviewed
                    who said that at one point they sent in a military team. A lieutenant colonel or
                    something came, looked around, and said, “Well, we could probably take the place
                    over with a battalion.”</p>

                <p>GOOD: Our concern ultimately was that this should not be a mess of problems for
                    us. We had no interest in taking it over. We didn't feel that it was our place
                    to go in there and teach them how to suck eggs. The Dutch were there to do that,
                    and we were happy to let the Dutch deal with this problem. We wanted to know
                    what was going on, and that's why we had some intelligence people coming in, but
                    it was not a high priority.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, because from their point of view, this was a problem they didn't need.
                    After all, the independence was only five years before it. Their perception of
                    the Surinamese was like their perception of the Indonesians. “This was an
                    underclass. We had ruled them for hundreds of years, so they're acting out of
                    place. We will discipline them and we will bring them back to some level of
                    sanity if we can.” Our U.S. position seemed to be, “Fine. Good luck, we will
                    help if we can.” To give you an idea of how small the country is, I remember my
                    wife and I were out on a drive on a Sunday off to see the Jodensavanne, which
                    was an old Jewish settlement. We stopped at the river waiting for the ferry to
                    come over, the two-car ferry, and a car, drove up behind, parked, also going to
                    go across. The guy comes out, I come out, and we start chatting. He knew my
                    name, he knew my address, (chuckling) and he knew what I did. I had no idea who
                    he was. We were very visible.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Conditional, we continued, we had some grants, we brought some people in.
                    One of my projects was to attempt to educate the ministry of education on what
                    our university degrees meant. I brought an educational expert down to have a
                    series of workshop with the officials at the ministry to explain to them where
                    our degrees fit in with the Dutch degrees, which was all they knew. They don't
                    fit very well, because the doctorandus, which is the Dutch degree, is a degree
                    of four to six years study in the specialized field that they're interested in.
                    It starts immediately upon entering the university.</p>

                <p>GOOD: They don't have those two years of general education that are our norm. So
                    when they took the graduate record exam, they went up to the ceiling on
                    competence in their field, biology let's say, but they were way down on general
                    knowledge. The foreign student advisors in the States were having to be educated
                    on educating the people in the departments that, “All right, this guy didn't
                    show up well on general knowledge, but he's super in the field that you're going
                    to teach him.” Then they had to get the word out to professors that these people
                    might have gaps in their knowledge of art and general history, but don't think
                    they're going to be faulted on the subject that you're teaching them for their
                    Master's program. Technically they were really, with the doctorandus, up to the
                    thesis level of a doctorate. They just didn't have the broadness. You could call
                    it a Master's, but it's more than a Master's, and yet it in many ways it puts
                    them a little bit off keel with the people who have Master's degrees here.
                    They're not quite as broadly based. So that was one of our projects.</p>
                <p>We provided tapes for them; we had clearances to the TV station for broadcast. I
                    got caught one time. I loaned the guy a tape for his personal viewing, which we
                    didn't have the broadcast rights for. Washington heard about it from Curacao,
                    because he put it on the Dutch network of the ABC network that's Aruba, Bonaire,
                    Curacao. I didn't get disciplined for it, but I was told to watch it. I went
                    back to him and said, “Listen, I don't have rights for that. Don't do that.” He
                    said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>We had an occasional speaker in. One fellow I remember came from Fairfield
                    College in Connecticut, apparently our best expert on Suriname at the university
                    systems up here, not that there's a great competition for that title.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Chuckling)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He came down with a viewpoint on Chile, which was, of course, the liberal
                    radical viewpoint that it'd been our fault and that we had pushed the coup. It
                    wasn't, of course, accurate, and I blasted him for it. He calmed down, and I
                    said, “Look, don't talk about it. You're not here to talk about it. You're to
                    talk about the United States; that's your topic.”</p>
                <p>So he behaved himself for the rest of the time. But I got some repercussions
                    because I reported it back to Washington. I didn't want anyone confused about
                    where this guy was coming from as a speaker because I walked into the room after
                    his speech, and people would say, “Ah, CIA, CIA, CIA,” because those were the
                    days when we were called ICA (International Communication Agency). I figured it
                    was just an anagrammatical confusion. Reading these stories last week on Chile
                    from Jack, the Teflon man as they call him, I agree with him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, and Jack was a riot. I remember one night we went out for a pizza, a
                    bunch of us, and he impersonated the U.S. ambassador. We got great service
                    because he's, what is he? Six-foot-five, something like that?</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: A big fellow, and very exuberant. In those days he had an afro cut, but
                    what he was saying in the series, I would sign on to because we had been
                    actively helping the opposition as they had. Our interest was in keeping the
                    opposition viable, as I had said earlier. They had known about the coup, but not
                    too much before. I remember a week before the camp we'd been up at the snow
                    lodge with some of them. They'd gotten a call and had to go back down, so that
                    they knew about it the week before, at least some of it.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Coups are fun, actually.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: In the coup in Chile things had been tight. That is, you really didn't want
                    to try to run around at night if you had sense. In Surinam with a pass, it was
                    just less traffic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Since our courier would come in late, the plane was late arriving every
                    night. The schedule was late. We'd have to go out to the plane, and we had our
                    pass, and we'd go out and get the courier and bring him in. We never felt that
                    there was any danger.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you, you mentioned it, and I recall too, that there was a point where, I
                    don't know whether it was a shootout at a cabinet meeting, or anyway, several of
                    the members of the regional junta...</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>GOOD: This was after I had left.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, after you left, got killed by other members of the junta. But during the
                    time you were there, was the military rule coming down heavily on the people; I
                    mean you know, a human right problem or something like that?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no, no. They still acted as if they wanted and needed and expected to
                    get popular support. Desi Bouterse would have town meetings, if you will, down
                    in the city square near the fort and harangue the crowd, and they'd respond.
                    They'd be talking in Taki-Taki rather than Dutch and “the greatness of our guy.”
                    So yes, they were looking for popular support and expected to have it, because
                    they thought that it was better to be run by the masses, than by the elitists.
                    They thought that this would be what the people would like. It was only after it
                    was obvious that they, this popular support, expected certain other things that
                    were inconvenient to them that squabbling began to start. It eventually
                    triggered the breakup of the junta. The reorganization of the junta was after I
                    had gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left, the junta was, I mean you weren't
                        seeing return to democracy on the horizon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, there was no obvious interest in setting any deadlines for elections or
                    that sort of thing. They didn't have people in a level of policy making who
                    understood what it was all about anyway. One of the fellows that we had planned
                    to send to the States under the Humphrey Fellowship had had to back away because
                    they needed him to run the foreign ministry. He had a doctorandus. He was a
                    sophisticated guy, but he was at their beck and call. He was not making policy.
                    If they didn't have preconceived ideas, they'd listen to what he said needed to
                    be done for the good of the country to maintain relationships and so forth, but
                    that was only to keep things going. Democracy was not something that they felt
                    had a high priority.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, were there visits from Cuba, for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: There weren't any state visits; there may have been visits. As I remember
                    it, the Surinamese went out to visit more than people came in to visit. There
                    may have been some people in my last months who came in, but it wasn't something
                    that was in the papers, no.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The fact that there were contacts caused concern, because they didn't want
                    the Cuban influence to be able to expand any more than it already had.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Q: I guess we've mentioned Granada was the New Jewel movement. It had gone rather
                    sour, and there were problems in Grenada. The Cubans were beginning to move in
                    there, as the next year was to see us putting troops in there. So I guess we
                    were more sensitive to Cuban influence?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, Cuba's has always been a bugger with the Caribbearelations and not
                    South American relations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: This was, you know, only a couple of years after the problems in Chile, and
                    we didn't want there to be another place where their influence goes after we had
                    managed or at least found other people who managed to get this settled down in
                    Chile.</p>
                <p>Q: Now did the airfield you mentioned, it was a rather large airfield, play any
                    role? Was that something we were concerned about falling into the wrong
                    hands?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, not that I know of. I understand that they've got McDonald's on the
                    road to the airport now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Jack Fernandez told me that he got the franchise for that. Actually he said
                    though, that the place hasn't changed much. They put in a couple of fast foods.
                    They've got a Kentucky Fried, two McDonald's. Actually the road to the airport
                    is still in about the same condition it was and not much expansion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>GOOD: A few people came back. I was talking to Jack's sister at the Hampton's
                    wedding, and she said that, let's see, they would be about 60 now, some of her
                    classmates who had gotten graduate degrees and had left the convent eventually.
                    Shortly thereafter they had tried to go back to see if they could be
                    contributors to the growth of Surinam and so forth. They didn't stay. Most of
                    them just disappeared back to Holland, welcomed back to Holland, because they're
                    productive people. But they found that things weren't there for progress. Again,
                    you've still got it run by basically uneducated people without a world view, not
                    much sophistication. Bouterse had done training in Holland. He had been out of
                    the country, and he was certainly more sophisticated than his counterparts, than
                    the junta. But he wasn't educated, so he was very, very limited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left this well run promising place in '81. Where did
                        you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I had applied in other places and had really wanted to go to Australia, but
                    I didn't have enough seniority to get the job. So I didn't get it. I got Hong
                    Kong and was brought back for Chinese language training, which I started in
                    August of that year. I should say that our son was born in March of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Surinam?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The doctors were very good, but the running of the hospital had gone down a
                    little bit. They said, “Don't bother.” Besides, having had one child overseas
                    and knowing the complications that resulted, I decided that I would not have
                    another one like that. So Jack offered us his house in Miami Beach. My wife went
                    up with her mother, and they had the baby. I saw one of the doctors at this
                    wedding this weekend.</p>

                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>GOOD: Jack Fernandez, who is probably, well. I believe, the biggest businessman
                    there in town. His wife is Puerto Rican. He had gone, at one point, back when
                    they newly married with a $5,000 stake from his uncle, to Chicago to play the
                    commodities market. He spent a week taking that $5,000 into a $100,000 I think.
                    He took the risks, pork bellies. Anyway, then with some of that money he had
                    bought this house in Miami Beach, which had been put there, built by a former
                    ambassador back in 1925, very nice place. I wasn't there. I had an exchange
                    professor down for two weeks; I had to stay down for that. When she went to the
                    hospital to have the baby, the nurse at the desk said, “Father of the son?” And
                    Jack said, “I'm not the father.” He had taken her in, and his nephew was with
                    him and she said, “Well, how about you?” “I'm not the father either.”She didn't
                    know what was going on.</p>
                <p>I saw one of the doctors this weekend at the party, and he remembered it. He
                    remembered the incident quite well. That was in Mount Sinai Hospital. There were
                    about 50 babies in there at that time when my wife was in the delivery. He was
                    the only child of American parents. The rest of them had come up from South
                    America so they could get their babies born in the States, so that eventually
                    they might be able to come as immigrants.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We went back to Washington for training by way of Bogota, picked up my
                    mother-in-law, and California, Oregon, bought a car and came back to Washington,
                    had ourselves set up in a house in McLean, started language training, and did
                    that from August until December, when the agency asked if I was still interested
                    in the Australian job, the press attach� there. I said yes, and very happily
                    exited Washington in February. I never got per diem, however, even though I
                    there less than six months. It was a very costly stay, very costly.</p>

                <p>GOOD: We only had one, and I never remember his name (Robert Nesen). He was a

                    the Republican Party in California and had gotten this reward. A very nice

                    because her grandchildren were back in California. But he was a wise man in that
                    he realized that he didn't know how to run an embassy. He had never had this
                    kind of training. So he really said to the DCM, Steve Lyne, he said-</p>

                    so, hold by Helms, the weird guy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He was on his way to Ghana as ambassador. So he ran the embassy, and the
                    ambassador would be trained, and he did what was necessary and was guided along,
                    and there were no problems with that. Canberra's complex, the embassy complex,
                    is particularly beautiful. It's built in the Williamsburg style with the lovely
                    chancellery and residence on a hill near the parliament, the new parliament. We
                    had branches in Sydney and Melbourne and Perth. State had consulates in those
                    places as well. We had libraries in each of those posts, as well as one in
                    Canberra itself. Oddly enough, the libraries in Australia at that time were
                    under the information office control. The press attach� ran them. Normally, and
                    every place else I've ever been, they were run by the cultural officer, which
                    having the libraries gave me something fun to do. The Australians were
                    great.</p>
                <p>It was however, not the society I expected to find. I should have been alert that
                    something was going on, because before I left, I had been invited out to a
                    farewell party by my old boss from Thailand, Rob Nevitt. He invited a couple of
                    other people who had also been to Australia on assignment. Rob had been PAO. In
                    retrospect I look back and realize that nobody that night had said anything good
                    or bad about the place, and that just isn't normal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They didn't express opinions on anything of any substance. They chatted
                    about the kangaroos and the koala. Then within a couple of months I understood
                    what they had been trying to tell me about this. That is that it may look like
                    California in 1951, but it isn't California in 1951. This is another culture.
                    Americans are tolerated, but feared in a cultural sense, a chip on the shoulder,
                    the idea that our culture is going to smother theirs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little bit like the Canadians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, although with less basis for it. They, however, do think of the
                    Americans on a daily basis. For one reason, it may be from the movie, it may be
                    from the book, it could be from radio, and whatever style, clothes, hair, and
                    they'd then think that we probably think about them that much. Well, you ask
                    somebody in the US about Australia, “When was the last time you thought about
                    Australia prior to the Olympics?” And you'd probably hear, “Who, where, never.”
                    You know. So they were prepared to be defensive when it came to cultural.</p>
                <p>On a personal basis I never had a problem. They'd ask me occasionally on the
                    squash floor about something that the U.S. had done, and they think, “It's your
                    fault.” But it wasn't meant serious.</p>
                <p>What was most difficult to adjust to was, well, there were two things that were
                    difficult to adjust to. One was the terrible racist attitude, and the other was
                    the gender problem. The women don't really count in Australia. The men are
                    number one, and their male mates are right there with them. If they have any
                    attention to divert from that, if they are married, the children will be of
                    significance. But the wife, generally speaking, isn't seen in public, at least
                    on a professional basis. I would go months sometimes without finding out whether
                    my sports buddies were married or not, or if they were married, if they had a
                    family. Certainly I was going to have a hard time finding out what kind of
                    education they had. Education is not something that you inquire about. They
                    assume that everybody went through grade school, and after that it doesn't
                    matter. So don't brag about having gone farther than that, because that's
                    gauche.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a concern in making sure that you're not sounding
                        likyou're trying to be above anyone or not, or is this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, you have to watch your assumptions. I was a bit annoyed one day. I
                    went over to the university to sign up for the university club. They said, “Do
                    you have a college education?” It's sort of insulting to a Foreign Service
                    officer to be suggesting that we don't, that we might not. Of course, the word
                    college I shouldn't say, because college in Australia is a high school, not a
                    university. They do understand that the universities like Oxford have colleges,
                    but in the Australian context, the college is a high school. I ran into that the
                    other day regarding a proposed trainee for a J-visa program. He said he had a
                    college diploma. I had to explain to the office where I was consultant that that
                    doesn't mean university. In this case, it didn't matter because the guy's going
                    to be an air conditioning trainee, but colleges are different.</p>
                <p>Racism definitely is a problem. A friend of mine, a department head at the
                    Canberra College of Advanced Education, where my wife was earning a degree in
                    communications, had blocked his advancement completely. He was at the top of
                    where he could go. Although he was from the right college and he had gotten his
                    doctorate at Oxford, he married a mixed Chinese Indian. Her father had been a
                    doctor in Hong Kong, I think. While his buddies, were already ministers of
                    state, he wasn't even going to make it any farther than the university
                    administration because of this taint.</p>
                <p>Q: We have, at least we really make a real effort to have, a gender race blind
                    Foreign Service. So I assume we have minority officers in our apparatus
                    in...</p>
                <p>GOOD: Not that I can remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We had women. If they were single, they were usually a bit unhappy because
                    you don't happily date an Australian man. They tell you, “The bags aren't
                    right.” If you could find an international, okay. And the tours were long.
                    You're talking four years for these single women. It's a long time to be without
                    a reasonable social life if you're single there.</p>
                <p>Q: My big experience in Australia was when I was constantly juggled in Saigon
                    during the war. A lot of American soldiers went there because they found it
                    heaven.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>Q: An American kid from the beginning, a boy, is trained to be nice to women and
                    to say nice things and all this. They found that they're in hog heaven when they
                    got to Australia because they've got beautiful women, smart, and these
                    Australians were sitting around goofing off and drinking beer and doing what God
                    knows what with sheep or something like that, but they certainly weren't paying
                    any attention to these women around.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, they might pay attention to them sometimes, but they didn't pay
                    attention in the proper civilized fashion from what these women know is going on
                    elsewhere. A female journalist friend of mine had gone to the States for a
                    month, I think, and came back. I asked her, “How did you find it?” Well, she
                    said, “The American men are 15 years more advanced than the Australians, and the
                    Australians are falling farther behind by the day.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughing)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We had problems with the Navy, of course. Perth was a stop for the Indian
                    Ocean task force. It was a conflict because of course these guys came with
                    money. They'd been out months at sea, they had money built up, and they were
                    ready to spend it. So the fathers in town who had shops really liked these guys
                    because they bought, went to restaurants, they filled the hotels and all this
                    sort of thing. But, of course, they had mixed feelings because their daughters
                    were excited about these fresh men in town, and had money, and had a reputation
                    of being nicer to women than the guys here in town. They would come in from,
                    (laughing) now there's not a lot of places to come from down here in Perth, but
                    they would come in from everywhere in the area and help the guys have a good
                    time. After a visit, the navy lawyer in Canberra would have to go out and settle
                    the damages in the hotels and so forth. A ship could lay out $6,000,000 in a
                    three-day stop easily, plus the money that might be going into reloading the
                    ship. Yes, I should have immediately brought in the fact that the American
                    single men at the embassy had a great time.</p>
                <p>Q: (Laughing) Back to the other issues of foreign relations, in the first place,
                    did you find yourself having to pussyfoot around the perception the United
                    States might be trying to overwhelm the Australians? Was this something that one
                    as a press officer had to be concerned about? I mean actually the whole effort,
                    in particular, the USIA effort?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, it wasn't a major policy line because the best way to address it was
                    in the long haul, in making sure that they had a well rounded view of what we
                    were like, which is what we pushed through our speakers, and our libraries,
                    satellite programs and so forth. By the way, Australia does have censorship, and
                    so everything we brought in for television had to be censored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Censorship in what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It had to cleared by a censorship board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean what were they looking for? Was it sex, or
                        violence?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>GOOD: Oh, God knows. Anything that would be harmful to their culture, and it was
                    up to them to decide. We didn't have trouble with our programs, even our series,
                    because we had in events Science World, for example. That's fine. Once they saw
                    what our program series was going to be, they would just say, “Okay, we don't
                    need to see every show.” But if we brought anything in special, like Let Poland
                    be Poland, (chuckling) - you remember that was one of the few movies that
                    Congress allowed us to show in the States - even that one wanted to see first.
                    They let that one in; it was all right. We had more concern with the problems of
                    nuclear powered ships. The Liberal Party there is the conservative party in
                    policy and they're opponents of the Labour Party. John Howard, who is now the
                    prime minister, was the foreign minister at that time. While we were there,
                    Fraser the Liberal PM lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fraser being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Fraser being the Liberal candidate and he turned himself into Elder
                    Statesman, a group the Commonwealth put together and shipped around to troubled
                    spots to consult on how to be better?</p>
                <p>He was replaced by the Labour group, which had not been in since 1972 when the
                    Governor General had thrown the prime minister out for a number of reasons that
                    remain controversial. The Labour Party stayed in throughout the rest of my time.
                    The defense minister replaced prime minister. He'd been an antique furniture
                    businessman I think. But they used us as the fall guy, the straight man if you
                    will. We would be blasted, criticism shoved over against us by the Liberals so
                    that criticism wouldn't come under them. They'd say, “Well, it's their fault.
                    Labour then would sort of claim us as being a front for the Liberals. It was
                    frustrating as a press attach�. Our standard response to any questions on the
                    nuclear power issue was, “No comment,” and that was 90 percent of the
                    questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well now, nuclear power in the context we're talking

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's right. Ship power. Well the question of nucleaweapons would be

                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>GOOD: Battleships, too. We had a no confirmation policy on any accusation that we
                    had nuclear weapons on board our ships. So while they assumed that we did, there
                    was not official confirmation, so they said, “Okay, we don't want nuclear
                    powered ships here. So we don't want U.S. ships. U.S. ships that are nuclear
                    powered, U.S. ships that may have nuclear weapons, we don't want them,” and
                    because one of our closest relationships is the ANZUS (Australia-New
                    Zealand-United States Security Treaty) relationship there.</p>

                <p>GOOD: The Liberal people were saying that of course, but Laboupeople weren't

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Oh, yes, yes. That was a convenient platform on which to hit us. They
                    didn't need anything else. That was so sexy that they could just keep hammering
                    us on that one. They didn't really find us offensive as people; they didn't find
                    our culture anything more than threatening. They liked our clothes, they liked
                    our books, and that was what the worry was. There was no danger that we were
                    going to Americanize Australia, of course, at all. It's just too far away. They
                    come from the same place we do, and they've got the common law. But they don't
                    have the bill of rights, which, startled to me as a lawyer. Its absence makes a
                    huge difference in a court system. So much of our legislation and our court work
                    is involved with due process. Without the Bill of Rights, where's your due
                    process? You've got it, but you don't have much to appeal on. There's not much
                    for people to complain about.</p>

                <p>GOOD: There you got a rotten Adelaide; I visited Murdock's originapress room in
                    Adelaide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But remember they're not educated. They're not educated in the sense that
                    we think of education. The odds were that they didn't have a high school
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There wasn't much of a push for the-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No. Thirty-seven percent of the population had a high school diploma in
                    1981. Now it was higher than that in Canberra because the collection of
                    government officials.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But even there it was only 45 percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that almost attitudinal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: You don't want to think of yourself as underprivileged, so here, I'm Dad,
                    and I left school at 15, which was the normal age. I was a school dropout. I
                    left school. So I'm going to criticize my kids because they quit too? If I
                    criticize them, I'm going to make myself look like a slob. Now you can look at
                    that another way. For example, my kid should have the opportunity that I didn't
                    have. It wasn't a lack of opportunity that was, it was the attitude that there's
                    more to life than school? Why stay in school? You can work on sheep ranches, you
                    can going work with cattle, you can work in mines, you can work on the sea, and
                    anybody can be a bureaucrat with a high school education or less. Who cares? The
                    military, they'd care. So no.</p>
                <p>There was another one of our employees, a woman who I guess was about 35 at that
                    point. She said, “My dad wouldn't let me continue in school past 15. He said,
                    'There's nothing that you can get from school beyond that that's going to be of
                    any good to you. They spoil you, ruin you, whatever. Get out and get a life.'"
                    With the dole automatically available to any school leaver at 15, there was no
                    particular economic reason to stay in. They'd get together and go up on the Gold
                    Coast, five or six of these young people, and use their dole money to rent a
                    nice apartment and live on the beach and every month go back home and check into
                    the unemployment office and see if there's anything that they had to turn down.
                    The artisans were having trouble finding apprentices to work in the trades,
                    because that meant a commitment for a number of years. It wasn't fun; it was
                    work. They were frustrated.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Q: What about the papers? Were the papers sort of the British ilk, you know,
                    mostly, to use a diplomatic term, “tits and ass” on the third page and highly
                    sensationalized over the one or two, sort of like The London Times?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, Melbourne, Sydney both had good papers. But yes, it was popular stuff,
                    so boring though. I had to read them. I had to report on what they were saying
                    about our policies of course. I think I spent too much time doing that, in
                    retrospect, because it wasn't of that much interest in Washington because
                    reactions didn't vary. It was predictable what they were going to do. Now they
                    were a rambunctious bunch. Shultz came through on a visit. He was Secretary of
                    State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Schultz?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: George Schultz. We set up a press conference in Canberra for him. He took
                    it good naturedly, but he said to them, “ You guys, you're the roughest bunch
                    I've had on the whole trip.” And there was nothing off the record.</p>
                <p>My friend, Peter from Melbourne was the reason I got the opportunity to go to
                    Canberra. He was yanked out of Melbourne. The lady who had been assigned to
                    Canberra as press officer went down and took Peter's job. Peter got yanked out
                    because at a cocktail party he had by chance mentioned the CIA base in Alice
                    Springs. It was well known. There had been a book out about it, God's Little
                    Acre. But it was something that you didn't talk about. You didn't acknowledge
                    its existence. When you flew into Alice Springs, there it was sitting over on
                    your left as you pulled in landing from the south. I got into trouble on an
                    Alice Springs visit because I drove my rented a car out to see what the base
                    looked like. I chatted a couple minutes with the guards, and they reported me to
                    the embassy. I got back, and I guess Steve Lyme had been called by the CIA and
                    said, “What's this guy doing up there.” And I said, “I was touring.” Well, it
                    blew over.</p>
                <p>But Peter had made reference to that to a journalist, and the journalist said,
                    “American spokesman talks about CIA base,” and he was out. I can remember
                    getting up at five AM a couple of mornings to dash down and find the paper it's
                    earliest out time to find out if they had blasted me on the front page or
                    credited me with something that I hadn't said in conjunction with the visit of a
                    VIP.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that this would have, doing this sort of thing, I mean
                    for journalists it's cute to do this thing, and you make points, but at the same
                    time, you're cutting yourself off at the knees because you're not going to be
                    talking to them. In other words, I would think this would cut down the
                    relationship with the press.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>GOOD: It wasn't important enough to stop them from putting out everything they
                    could find, even if it wasn't well researched. One lunchtime, I was eating my
                    sandwich in the conference room, and the CAO was on duty.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Cultural affairs officer. A journalist called in and asked a question about
                    one of our bases, and he answered it. He was kicked out the next day. Our side
                    pulled him out because he had gotten into an area that was not for comment.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's right, it isn't fun; I didn't like to say, “No comment.” It would be
                    much better if I could have been able to have a decent relationship, go off the
                    record, and give them a little. The best we could do was to give them our
                    wireless file material for background, so that they would have a broader
                    picture. But they really weren't interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It does sound like these were almost “untalkable to” (not

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, exactly and even in a social setting you had to be very careful. But
                    remember I said they didn't have a university education generally. They were not
                    truly professional.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things striking to me would be that as the world is changing,
                    particularly in the technical field, you have countries like China and India
                    which are producing hundreds of thousands, if not more, of highly educated
                    people, particularly in the science fields and all that. Here's Australia
                    sitting down unable to compete on that level or not?</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>GOOD: Well, it's true. A couple of other things I should put in for background.
                    New Zealand was slightly more educated by about a tenth of a percentage point.
                    There had been no increase in slots at the universities in Australia from 1972
                    on, certainly in '85 when I left. The Liberal government had not expanded the
                    system, so there hadn't been a place for people to go. Now this was at the same
                    time it was becoming much more difficult to go to Europe to get your education
                    because you couldn't work with the EC (European Commission) coming in. There was
                    a definite divide between the people in 1981 too, who were 35 and above or 35
                    and younger. Those who were over 35 were more likely to have done a year or more
                    in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. They almost all had that Wanderyahr or some
                        sort.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Exactly and it was at least a year. If they were going to leave Australia,
                    they were going to stay out a while. While they didn't necessarily go to Europe
                    to go to school, they were able to work. They could earn their living so they
                    could stay, and they traveled. Back in the '70s you would see Australians, you
                    remember, all over the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, all over the place, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I remember seeing them in Brazil, in Bolivia, everywhere. After the EC
                    closed down job opportunities didn't have a large group of people under 35 who
                    had been abroad because they couldn't afford it. Since your younger journalists
                    are going to be under 35, of course, the active ones, that's where your noise
                    was coming from. When the Labor government came back in, they did begin to open
                    up more slots in the universities. But it took them time because they were
                    having a depression there for a little while as well. They had, unlike most
                    countries I've been in, a policy that adults could go to college, that is adults
                    who had had a break, or had not finished high school, could get their high
                    school equivalency and go on to the university. But they were beginning to have
                    to cut those people back in order to have slots for the younger people to come
                    in. By expanding the slots in the university after I left, they intensified the
                    paranoia if you will, the tunnel vision. It meant that where students had been
                    able in the past to go abroad to study, there were now fewer economic
                    opportunities for them to do that and more opportunities to stay. So they tended
                    to be more inside the corral than they had been before. You had still people
                    traveling, and more people who were going to the States than had been the case
                    before. It didn't mean that a lot of people were going abroad for their higher
                    education. When they came back with the American degree, it was still sort of
                    secondary. If you had an Oxford or Cambridge degree, that was the best. Anything
                    else is less than the best, and always an American degree was less than the
                    best.</p>

                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>GOOD: Oh, the Australian schools are good in science as well.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, but the United States, it's not that it's something American. Most of our
                    sciences, I mean our international, oh, hell, this is just where the world
                    scientific community settles.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Sure, and if you wanted to be world class in anything, you had to leave
                    Australia. The problem was that if they did leave after having gotten their
                    education, they didn't come back. It wasn't just in the sciences. If you wanted
                    to be an astronaut, of course, you had to come to the States. Olivia

                    Australia, the art critic for the Time Magazine. He's never gone back seriously.
                    They go back to visit, they keep their contacts, but they're not going to live
                    back there. So I think that it was becoming more closed as a result of the
                    European Community and the fact that you had to get your education in Australia
                    to the extent that you got it. I'll have to look up the figures to see if
                    they've gotten their high school diplomas above 50 percent or not.</p>
                <p>Q: This is, of course, during the Reagan administration and early on when
                    particularly when we were taking a pretty tough line on the Soviet Union and
                    all. How was that plane?</p>
                <p>GOOD: We'd occasionally get campers, protesters in front of the embassy in
                    Canberra, not the Russians usually. It was the Yugoslavs, the Croats accusing us
                    of not being even handed in our treatment. We would be reporting on any Soviet
                    activities there, but no, that didn't seem to be a big problem. Their problem
                    was China, not Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you were saying the big problem is China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, from their perspective China is a threat. They were trying to develop
                    relations. CCA (Canberra College of Advanced Education) which I think is now
                    called the University of Canberra, and the main university in Canberra, the ANU
                    (Australian National University) had exchange programs, bringing students down,
                    sending students up, exchanging professors, that sort of thing. They have a fear
                    of this monster on top of them; this billion-population country that they feel
                    definitely must be interested in this empty country down below. The truth of the
                    matter is that the Chinese aren't. They're not interested in taking it over from
                    a political point of view. It's too far away, it's too empty; they've got
                    resources, but it's easier to buy them than it is to steal them. But if an
                    Australian saw an Asian on the street, it ruined his day, or did back then.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well no, they had been bringing them in from the Vietnam War, and this was
                    really disturbing to me. But it's kind of like this policy now of the
                    government, most of the Labour government pushing it, to apologize to the
                    Aborigines. Now you notice John Howard refuses to apologize. He says it's a
                    shame that they have such a tough time, but he won't apologize. The Labour
                    government however felt sympathy for these families, and they instituted the
                    kind of thing that we have, and that is to gather the family together, if
                    possible. So they'd get one Cambodian down, and then you'd have 55. They had a
                    higher per capita take of refugees than we did from the Vietnam War, and we
                    thought we had a lot. They didn't get as many of course, but there were fewer of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were getting from other places too, of course,
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: And other places. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos were strong. Cambodia, in
                    particular, bothered them, I guess. If they stayed, they weren't so much in
                    Canberra; they were down the coast. Sydney got the bulk, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The fact that there were Orientals coming into Australia
                        was thabeginning to make a difference or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, they'd had, of course, Orientals. They had brought them in for the gold
                    mining like we did, but then they put a freeze on, even stronger than ours. They
                    also had some resistance to the buying of properties, but that wasn't really a
                    legal resistance. There was just this residual resistance to people coming from
                    Singapore looking to invest their money in Australia. But frankly, the Japanese
                    put a lot more money into the Gold Coast area. A lot of it was a tourism kind of
                    thing. They'd buy apartments from which they could go to in the Barrier Reef
                    area up along the northeast coast of Queensland.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>But it was just the fear of the numbers. And of course the Asians work and
                    they're willing to postpone the realization of their desires to the next
                    generation if that's what looks like the better way to do it. So they'll live
                    above the store, and they'll work more hours than the Australian would be
                    willing to work or interested in working. Now the Australians still had the
                    restriction on how many hours you could have your shop open. That put a kink
                    into how much they could, but then they were pushing this as well, so that if
                    you opened up a gas station, you had an all purpose gas station that would sell
                    everything from ice cream to gas. They would stay open on Sunday, whereas the
                    ice cream store might not be able to. The furniture store certainly couldn't.
                    Each major city had a different night of the week that they could stay open. It
                    was Thursday in one town, Friday in another, Wednesday in the third. So these
                    people were willing to work. They were interested in education. They were
                    different. They put a premium on education. So they just weren't fitting in, but
                    they were inevitable. That was the fear. Because they were inevitable and there
                    were so many of them to come, ultimately if not sooner than that, Australia
                    would find itself overwhelmed in a different culture.</p>
                <p>Q: What about, speaking of other cultures coming in, back in my time when I was
                    in the '60s, there was considerable migration from Yugoslavia, what was then
                    Yugoslavia, to Australia? How about these groups that were coming? They had had
                    a big emphasis on European migration.</p>
                <p>GOOD: They had, after the war of course, accepted people from displaced persons'
                    camps in Europe. But they were not accepted in the first generation as
                    Australians. Second generation blended in because obviously they'd been born
                    there and were educated there. But it was going to be the third generation
                    before they were considered Aussies, and they were still not going to be
                    considered real Aussies, just like the Brits, Poms, as they called them, were
                    not quite equal. We probably rated just a little bit below the Poms. The Poms
                    were probably more threatening to the Australians because they had the closer
                    link with the Commonwealth. For example, my landlord was Hungarian. His wife was
                    German. They didn't associate much with the real Australians. They had their
                    clubs. You had ethnic clubs all over the place. You had Yugoslavs, you had
                    Spanish, and you had the Greeks. Greeks were big; I think there are more Greeks
                    in Melbourne than there are any places outside of Athens. Maybe they've beat
                    Athens by now. They ran the restaurants. The Italians were into vegetables,
                    delivering to the market. You don't eat better than you do in Australia. I mean
                    the vegetables are great; foods are great; and the meat was good.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>They brought with them this tradition of hatred for the British because there
                    were a lot of Irish. Now how many actually were descendants of the Irish who
                    were brought over as criminals, I don't know, or as dissidents, I don't know.
                    The academics would say this, “It's more of a cultural tradition than it is a
                    blood lineage.” But that was one of the problems with the education. The Irish
                    had not been allowed to study back in Ireland. They came to Australia, and they
                    had tried. But of course you see, that works against the idea that we lack it,
                    education. We don't want them to have it, because we don't have it. If they get
                    it, then they'll probably be a step up from us. But the Australians who were not
                    born in Australia were very much a part of their own groups. There was some
                    mixing in the social clubs, but it didn't go much farther than that. In squash
                    club, for example, my team was one Australian, one New Zealander, one South
                    African, and I. You'd find an occasional Indian. But they didn't like South
                    Africans. They felt a little closer to the New Zealanders because they were in
                    their own neighborhood. But of course they've taken South Africans, migration in
                    recent years because of the change of the apartheid policy. They do want people,
                    and they're willing to take people who are going to offset this (chuckling)
                    horrible hoard of Chinese that they fear will be coming down. I remember
                    meeting, I think I mentioned earlier, this family that had been from Rhodesia.
                    They'd sent one of their families to southern Australia so they'd have a place
                    to leap if it were necessary. Australia had lots of opportunities. If you spoke
                    English, fine. Although it's not quite the same English, it's close. So they
                    liked the whites; they didn't like the Latins, and they didn't like the blacks
                    at all. A friend of mine from the Nigerian embassy went up to Brisbane before
                    the Commonwealth Games one year just to sound it out and report back on what the
                    facilities were and so on. He came back, and he said, “I'll never go back there
                    again.” After dark they were not liked; they felt threatened, because they
                    really don't have up there any blacks except the Aborigines. The Aborigines have
                    been treated as really underclass.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that there was sort of a divide that used to be anyway in the UK
                    (United Kingdom) between labor and conservative and that it was really a class
                    divide and all that? Was that translated, or was it a different system in a
                    way?</p>
                <p>GOOD: There was a divide I guess, but I wouldn't call it class because the
                    Australians didn't recognize class, and they didn't have a noble class, of
                    course. They didn't like anyone to show himself or herself as better
                    economically either. There, of course, were people that were better off than
                    others. But they all wanted to be considered at the same level. They, as I may
                    have said earlier, were willing to accord a bit of notoriety to some who had
                    made it big outside the country. Paul Hogan was able to come back, and they gave
                    him that special, but then he'd been sort of special because he was a crazy guy.
                    When I was there, he was one of the comedians on the television. They liked his
                    eccentricities because it catered to their prejudices. Basically, they didn't
                    want to have a class in a hierarchical fashion. They had to devise on a
                    horizontal basis in that you would have your labor, the people who actually
                    worked with their hands in machines as opposed to the sheep ranchers, as opposed
                    to the miners perhaps, as opposed to the bureaucrats. But they weren't this way;
                    they were horizontal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because that wouldn't allow for them a class divide

                <p>GOOD: Yes, the only class divide was between everybody and thaborigines.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes. Did we get involved? I mean were any of our policies particularly, aside
                    from the nuclear thing, I mean we'd been pushing a lot of things, which sound
                    innocuous. I mean we push education, we push diversity and ethnic diversity, and
                    we push women's rights. Even though it was the Reagan administration, it was
                    still going on. Did this clash at all with Australians or just didn't resonate
                    or what?</p>
                <p>GOOD: It didn't resonate. I mean they had democracy; I pushed democracy there. We
                    might suggest that they have more libraries, but their libraries were free. They
                    had no travel restrictions. The education was there if you wanted it. I mean,
                    gender, we weren't into gender with that problem at that point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Sure. We'd, I remember, brought one lady over who only reinforced their
                    opinion that women didn't belong, didn't have the whatever to make it at the
                    high level. She was dumb, and they didn't think that that did us any good to
                    have this strangely ineffective...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was she? She was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Oh, she was a radio type on the Voice of America. She had a morning show,
                    and of course, she was noted because they could hear her on short wave. They
                    thought that maybe she'd resonate with an audience, and she didn't. She later on
                    made ambassador. (Laughing) I knew her DCM. It was in the back... (Laughing)Q:
                    With newspapers and all, did you have sort of a daily press briefing, or a
                    non-weekly, or monthly or what have you, press briefing?</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>GOOD: Do you mean at the embassy?</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, usually it was the PAO who did it over at the country tea meeting. We
                    were reporting back on a daily basis to Washington. Papers were in English.
                    People could read their own papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you say, there really wasn't much change, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, no, the papers were there. You could read them. You could listen to the
                    radio. You could watch television. You knew what was going on. We did a little
                    bit more effort on it because we were looking for themes and focuses and
                    anticipated problems that we could let Washington know about how our policy was
                    being bashed this week as opposed to last week perhaps. While I spent more time
                    than, in retrospect, I think I should have, and certainly more than I thought I
                    wanted to, watching television and listening to the radio and reading the
                    newspapers, anyone else could have done the same thing, if they'd been
                    interested that much.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the relative low level of education. What about our libraries?
                    Was this reflected in the type of books we'd stock in Australia?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, we stocked our books based upon our interests, not theirs. In Canberra
                    we had a very special situation because we were most interested in servicing the
                    parliamentarians and the government bureaucrats; so we were into documents. We
                    had an online service. That was one of our early ones. They could come back to
                    the computer to pick up information that they needed. We had a lot more than the
                    usual number of magazines available for people to come in to read. We were
                    located, close to the Parliament, a couple of blocks, and in the National Press
                    Center. We were not in the embassy. They could walk over if they wanted and send
                    their staffs over to make requests, which was our top priority for servicing the
                    government officials, whether they were legislative or executive. The
                    circulating library itself, had the standards; art, American literature, some
                    history books, and so on. We focused I'd say more on the documents and
                    government publications. We didn't want them to have to reinvent the wheel. They
                    didn't want to either. So if they had a project that they were looking on to do,
                    they came to our sources to see what Congress might or had produced, and get
                    that first.</p>

                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>GOOD: In the schools there, no, some. I can remember visiting some high schools
                    that had some focus on that. But it was the exception, not the rule.</p>
                <p>Q: I imagine this was almost, as a tour, it was more maybe frustrating, maybe
                    sterile, or something like that, what I'm gathering from you.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's where I had good contact with the more normal people, and they could
                    be bureaucrats. I didn't know them because they were government officials, I
                    knew them because they were people in the community. The facilities were good.
                    We had good competitions. I knew wherever I went I could stop into a squash
                    court, because we had reciprocal relationships. Distances were immense. It was
                    an expensive country. I wasn't paid well enough to be able to vacation much. So
                    my wife and son were pretty well stuck. We had the usual holidays, pretty well
                    stuck in the Canberra area. I mean, we wouldn't think of driving for the week
                    into Chicago very often and that's what you're talking about.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We might and occasionally went to Sydney. It was a four-hour drive. To go
                    to Melbourne, it's an eight-hour drive. That's a lot of driving. You'd fly down,
                    but expensive! Flight is more expensive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1981, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, 1985. I got there in '82, left in January of '85, and was direct
                    transferred. In retrospect, I should have stayed. But my propensity has been to
                    see other parts of the world, and I jumped before I should've. The new PAO
                    coming in turned out to be one great guy, but it was too late to change. The
                    plan to go to Yugoslavia on a direct transfer cost me a home leave. I never got
                    around to getting it. My wife, it turned out that she had to have a minor
                    operation as soon as we got to Washington, and so she recuperated in the Holiday
                    Inn in Rosslyn. Not good, she was in miserable shape and had no support
                    network.</p>
                <p>We arrived in Yugoslavia in the middle of winter to find out that our house,
                    which was a duplex, half of a unit, had its under-the-floor pipes broken because
                    they hadn't kept the furnace going. It was a new house, mildew all over the
                    place, you couldn't get rid of it, and it turned out that both my son and my
                    wife were allergic to the mildew.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>It was also a new position. I was taking the new executive officer job there.
                    About seven years before the position had been removed. They had finally decided
                    that they had to get things back under control. They had to put an exec
                    (executive) officer back in to run it. We had a branch office in every one of
                    the republics, as they call them in Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, five republics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Plus Belgrade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: State said it couldn't cut any of them because they said, “If you have a
                    presence in one, you've got to have a presence in all. And we had no choice. As
                    a result our budget was 95 percent tied up by fixed expenses. We had no way to
                    play with programming, except as we could find somebody to sponsor it for us. We
                    didn't really have American companies there to tap as we had in Santo Domingo or
                    even Australia. So it was a difficult time because of the resistance - you can
                    imagine from the administrative section at the embassy to somebody coming in and
                    taking back under agency control what they had been running however they wanted
                    to before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '85 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: '86 because my wife was medically evacuated, in September o'85 and I stayed
                    on until March of '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I was setting up the executive office and trying to find money.</p>
                <p>Q: USIA's executive office?</p>
                <p>GOOD: USIA's executive office provided the infrastructure, doing the budgeting
                    for all of the branches, personnel. We had, of course, security problems. We had
                    housing problems. It was a time of real shortage. I mean, not as bad as it's
                    gotten, but comparatively speaking there wasn't a lot to buy for eating. There
                    wasn't much in the stores. Store window fronts would be empty. You go down to
                    the market and maybe find a paprika or two. We had to import. We'd get
                    deliveries from the Frankfort commissary. We would get milk down from
                    Austria.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Because of the restrictions of the weather and so forth, there wasn't that much
                    to travel. Bribes. We got there in late January, early February; this was
                    February. In March my wife, our 5 year old went, and I went to the coast for
                    vacation. We spent two weeks together, and then I came back. My wife stayed for
                    another three weeks just to get out of this horrible house situation and hoped
                    that spring would help. It turned out it didn't. There was another problem. They
                    had very nicely put a brand new rug on the floor after the old one had been
                    ruined, and they got the best they could get there in Yugoslavia. Unfortunately
                    it shed and shed. It would never stop shedding. Ultimately of course, you
                    vacuumed it out so there was nothing left, but that left a lot of lint in the
                    air. The doctor was concerned for Mark's health on that one.</p>
                <p>But talk about a lifestyle. As a resident in the country, we got resident rates
                    at the hotel. The exchange rate was in our favor, obviously. But it cost me $13
                    a day for hotel room and food, three meals for the three of us at the hotel at
                    the coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you at the coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: We were at Porec, which is directly across from Venice on the Istrian
                    Peninsula, which is a lovely peninsula, as you probably know. It's really more
                    Roman than it is, well it's certainly more Roman than Yugoslavian, although part
                    of that Roman is more modern Italy. Anything that was built to last was not
                    built by the Yugoslavs. That's for sure. I'd sit in the porch at the hotel room
                    and listen to the tiles pop off the walls in the bathroom. The roads that were
                    in good condition were the roads that the Italians had put in. The water system
                    was the Italian system. The sewage was an Italian system.</p>
                <p>It was a German tourist area. All the way down the coast from Trieste you found
                    resort locations, all the way down to Pula. They had nude beach resorts for the
                    Germans, which you didn't see from the road. But if you took your boat out on a
                    tour to visit some of the ocean sites, you'd see them out there surf boarding,
                    windsurfing nude.</p>

                <p>GOOD: Fabulous story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Go back to Belgrade now. Who was the ambassador while you
                        werthere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Anderson was there; Scanlan came in.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, David was there when we got there, and then John Scanlan came down.
                    Both excellent, although I think David was better. But Scanlan was very good as
                    well, a little more pompous. David was not pompous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. I knew David in Belgrade when he was “the”
                        junioofficer in the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Really! (Laughing)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he worked as a vice consul for me. What about Tito?
                        Had hdied?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did he die?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Let's see, when did he die? He died about '81 I think. That's when the
                    economy was at its best. And you can imagine, you know the system where your
                    high three for your local employees, they were making much less than they
                    would've recouped if they could retire because of the exchange rate. Their high
                    three was back '78 to '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The high three refers to the highest three years of your
                        salary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your pension is based on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: So anybody who was eligible to retire and didn't retire wathought to be
                    very foolish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, which meant you got rid of your best staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes. Now there were a couple of fools, by their standards, who stayed on,
                    but basically, once they could retire, they did retire. Our staff was fairly
                    young, so we didn't have people retiring on us.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>Q: You were, of course, really looking for allocation of money, was that right? I
                    would have thought that for example, to try to have parity between something in
                    Skopje in Macedonia and in Ljubljana in Slovenia, I mean you know one's a very
                    sophisticated place, and the other is, to put it mildly, pretty backward.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, well, you weren't going to have parity however you tried, obviously.
                    They've shown that to be true, no question about that. But we, of course, were
                    under the government regulations on what had to be paid. We were still paying
                    out of everybody's salary, every pay period, something for the 1965
                    earthquake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They had 18 different allocations for every salary. Vacatiopay you had to
                    be allocated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I was involved in that. I was in Rome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: All kinds of these things, and then you had the exchange rate change, and
                    so you had to continue to refresh your budget. It was not an easy time. But we
                    had some excellent, excellent employees in the budget office in the embassy,
                    really first-rate clerical staffs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the government? This is when they were going
                        througthis rotational system where they...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, every year you changed presidents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that, you know, this isn't going to
                        work,or wasn't it working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I'm just reading Zimmermann's book, our last ambassador'book, on his time
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: And it got worse. It depended upon when. When I was there, it was still
                    working, but not well. The biggest problem was that everything was run by
                    committee, not just at the top level, but everywhere through the country. Every
                    decision had to be unanimous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The committees each were representative of every republic,
                        guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, yes, every republic had a representative on the top governmental
                    board, and one of those was president. It rotated republics every year, but at
                    every governmental level, things were run by committees. I wouldn't buy fish in
                    Belgrade because normally it came up by train. There were a couple of hundred
                    jurisdictions it had to go through, which might have delayed it 15 minutes here,
                    and hour there. Who knows how many days it had taken that fish to get to
                    Belgrade! It just wasn't running well. But it wasn't yet ready to fall
                    apart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Kosovo raise its head?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Kosovo was of course noted. A Slav would say, “Ha, ha, there's a Kosovar.
                    He's a gypsy! He's darker! He's shorter! He's not intelligent!” The government
                    policy to make sure that every high school had not only the language of the
                    republic, but also a second republic language as the two language choices. You
                    could go on and take something else after that, and they designated what
                    republic language would go in as the second language in each school. The schools
                    that got Albanian as their second language were not happy. They didn't like
                    that. The idea that genocide was being exercised, or done by the Albanians
                    against the Slavs, was a topic of regular conversation. In Serbia, that was
                    assumed. True or not, it was assumed.</p>
                <p>When you know that 90 percent, maybe 95 percent of the population down there is
                    Albanian or Kosovar, not Serbian, there was a possibility that there might have
                    incidents in which the Albanians were killing Serbs. But really it appears, from
                    what I can read since, that since the Serbians were in charge of the government
                    and had the military control, an Albanian who might try to foment some problems
                    was dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The Serbians were attempting to take over land, and they were generally
                    dominating, except in numbers. And of course, it was not a province. It was only
                    an autonomous area, which was run by Serbia, just as the Vojvodina to the north
                    was. So it didn't have full ranking, and Slovenia, obviously, was unhappy. One
                    of the reasons it pulled out, ultimately, was that it was feeling that it was
                    funding this poor, poverty struck place. It was a poor place. The roads were
                    bad. The people were shepherds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It was bad.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You were there only a relatively short time, but was
                        thfeeling of the embassy that this place might split up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: There was the fear, yes. Yes, because they just didn't seem to have any way
                    to get it together. The Slovenians thought themselves better, felt a chip on the
                    shoulder that they weren't being treated equally with the Serbs. Since they
                    obviously were more sophisticated, had a better economy, and so forth, they
                    didn't think this was fair. Language was a problem.</p>
                <p>But as a tour, I consider it one of my highlights because I enjoyed the people, I
                    enjoyed the country, I got around a lot because it wasn't Australia. (Laughing)
                    After a year, here I could travel. It was close; it was cheap. I did all the
                    traveling I could. One of the younger officers in USIS and I and his fianc�,
                    they got married as soon as the embassy sent them on TDY to Sarajevo. They
                    didn't want to be forced to get married in Belgrade. So they said, “No.” As soon
                    as he got TDY to Sarajevo, they got married; it was okay, great fun. He had
                    Russian and Serbian, so no problem with the languages. We just went all over the
                    place.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you run across problems in the rivalry, which is now everybody knows, but
                    was anybody who served there apparent, particularly Croatia and Serbia? Did you
                    have problems in your organization there?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, we probably had a little more trouble down in Sarajevo and Bosnia in
                    that they were really backwatered down there and didn't like it, because they
                    had not been backwater under the Austrians. That had been the Austrian
                    provincial. Zagreb did consider itself to be as important as Belgrade. It wasn't
                    getting that kind of comparable reaction from the Serbs. We weren't in the
                    middle of the fight between the provinces, and it didn't affect my work at
                    all.</p>
                <p>Q: I was wondering whether it affected your work, in that I remember when I was
                    running the consular section in Belgrade. My local employees had no sympathy for
                    or really working with those in Zagreb.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, well, we didn't have that type aid working. Our units were pretty
                    autonomous at the local level. I didn't sense that in our organization. You felt
                    it with the Kosovar, but we didn't have a post down there at that time. We
                    didn't get that one till fairly recently in Pristina. Skopje was out of sight,
                    of course. The language was different, and people didn't travel that much
                    between.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>There was, of course, a negative feeling toward the Greeks, although that
                    politically has changed a bit in recent years. I remember, one of our Greek
                    employees in the admin (administrative) section nearly got killed by the husband
                    of one of the ladies with whom he apparently was more than professionally
                    involved. But they all rolled with the punch and they got over it. But the
                    Greeks were not really accepted as equals with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was the Macedonian issue, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, yes, no question about that one.</p>
                <p>Q: This might be a good place to stop, I'm thinking. We'll pick it up then in,
                    well, '86 when you have to leave for medical reasons because of your wife. Now
                    Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>GOOD: I should say though, before we close that my travel wasn't just internal.
                    The Embassy had a policy that we were told that we should follow, of being out
                    of the country every month, somewhere out of Yugoslavia. We did, except the
                    first month and the last month I was there, because you can get to Austria, to
                    Bulgaria, to Romania, to Greece, to Italy, very simply. It was more of a
                    psychological thing. I didn't feel the pressure that those who'd served in
                    Russia seemed to feel about being watched all the time. I thought, “Gee, that's
                    an extra benefit. I'm secure. Nobody's going to bother me because I'm being
                    watched.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Never bothered me, but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But those who'd been in Russia, they had this paranoia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I went back to Washington, the Voice of America.</p>

                <p>Today is October 10, 2000. Paul, you were with the Voice of Americfrom '86 to
                    when?</p>
                <p>GOOD: To '88.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I was in the International Negotiation Office, which had been set up in the
                    start of the Reagan administration by Charlie Wick, who came in as the new
                    director of the agency. He was interested in expanding the Voice of America
                    signal, strength, coverage, whatever. To do that he needed to have bigger sites
                    and of course better equipment to get up to date. This office was negotiating
                    for new Voice of America sites around the world. We had a number of projects
                    going on, some of which actually finished, some of which had to be backed away
                    from. What Charlie Wick did was to go for the Cadillac version of the equipment,
                    and that took a lot more money and a lot of time. By the time they got
                    themselves geared up to really get moving, Congress was more reluctant to let
                    them spend the kind of money they were spending.</p>
                <p>I found very quickly and quite shockingly that there was a different perception
                    of money at the Voice of America. Overseas, we nickel and dime ourselves very
                    comfortably. But when I was doing the progress reports on our negotiations, one
                    of my weekly chores, I never wrote a figure that I could remember under a
                    million dollars. I might put .9 million, maybe even .75, but we didn't have
                    figures that were considered to be important enough to be dealt with with less
                    than a million base figure or the word million after them. Because they were
                    projects that could cover a great deal of territory question or fudge, we were
                    an attractive element for the general consul's office.</p>
                <p>The engineers weren't restricted on travel like the normal travelers for the
                    government; they charge their travel up against the project. It wasn't quite the
                    same kind of auditing situation. So if we wanted a lawyer to go to, let's say,
                    Botswana, where we had a project going, a lawyer leaped up ready to go this
                    afternoon, if necessary. Whereas my experience with the GC (General Counsel)
                    office in prior jobs was that you had to negotiate for weeks, if not months, to
                    get their attention focused on your problem. These usually were minor problems,
                    but not really more minor than some of the jobs that we sent them out on for the
                    UGA. We had one lawyer who just loved Botswana, not because of the job, but
                    because of the inexpensive semiprecious stones that could be picked up for a
                    song, and the goat hair, mohair clothes, shawls, and so forth that were
                    available.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>So it was quite a different perspective on how government operations worked. Now
                    because it was high profile, that is OMB (Office of Management and Budget) was
                    interested in it, because it was a lot of money. We were talking hundreds of
                    millions in the projects overall. There was attention frequently at the front
                    office in USIA and our chief, Mort Smith, who was a deputy director of the
                    Voice. There were two deputy directors. There was the regular line operator, and
                    then this special deputy, who was focused solely on the negotiations.</p>
                <p>Ours was a very small office. Gunther Rosinus, Ken Yates, Mort Smith, a couple of
                    secretaries, and I were all that were involved. Our job was to keep an eye on
                    the engineers. We all learned, and none of us were engineers in that office,
                    that engineers are difficult to pin down to a fixed figure. They will constantly
                    change, and their reasons may be unintelligible. In any event, we had to keep
                    track of where they were going.They had some very, very nice, very understanding
                    engineers. Unfortunately, the operations' engineer was not. I think he passed
                    away. He came down with cancer, and that ultimately calmed him down. But my
                    first encounter with him was the kind of encounter you get with a bully. I had
                    to stop him and say, “Look, we can't have a relationship like this. I don't work
                    for you. You don't work for me. We have need for mutual understanding and
                    exchange of information. I'm sorry but that's the way it's got to be.” We
                    started over again, and we got along fine. I saw him a couple of years ago at
                    the Voice just before he retired, and still we got along fine.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things I've been told with the Voice, and maybe it wasn't true at
                    this period, but that the Voice of America is absolutely permeated with the idea
                    of short wave, and short wave was becoming less and less a means of hearing
                    things and all that. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, you're right, although the perception then was still in infancy. When I
                    came back to the Voice in '97 that was really a very strong feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But in '86 when I got there, they were about to begin one of the periodic,
                    I think it was once every 10 years at that time, world conference on
                    frequencies. I attended, at one point, a meeting at the old executive office
                    building, honchoed by somebody from the NSC, that gathered together those
                    elements of the government who were dealing with and interested in frequencies
                    in preparation for that meeting.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>The most striking thing I learned was that, at that time, there was a huge band
                    of frequencies, which was blocked by the military, who were not interested in
                    yielding up any of it. This was making it more difficult because they were still
                    under the process of developing ways that they could focus frequencies that were
                    next to each other or close to each other without lapping over interference.
                    They'd come a long way along that route, but they needed to have more room in
                    order to cover the area of the world that they wanted to cover.</p>
                <p>Now another thing that was being looked at, at this point, was the question of
                    being able to use, and you've probably heard it more recently as well, of being
                    able to receive the signals directly on handsets from the transponders in
                    satellites rather than having to use ground signals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having to skip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Instead of having bouncing around like the short wave does, bringing it
                    down to a hand held set. Now at that time, already, the hand set capacity was
                    there. The manufacturers had the units, they could produce, and they could
                    produce them cheaply, but they didn't have a signal yet (chuckling) because the
                    transponders were still too large.</p>
                <p>Q: These transponders were essentially things that read broadcast signals that
                    were beamed up to them from the United States to a satellite?</p>
                <p>GOOD: That's right, and then they would beam them back down, and istrong
                    enough</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That it'd be picked up by a cheap handset.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Right, and focused enough so that the cheap handset could pick it up.
                    That's feasible now, I gather. It could be coming. The change that's really come
                    though had gone from the analog to the digital. The Voice has changed its
                    broadcasting, I think, completely shifted over, phased over to digital. Now this
                    has caused problems, because if you don't have a set that receives digital,
                    you're not going to get the signal. So people have had to shift their
                    instruments in the field to pick it up. Because a lot of the interest in the
                    Voice in recent years has been to provide the news or the programming to
                    stations around the world to rebroadcast from the ground, not from the
                    satellites, they wanted to be able to deliver a high quality. Since their
                    audience at this point was not the general public so much as it was the foreign
                    stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about '86 to '88. This had not arrived yet,
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That's right, but they were talking about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were talking about it, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They wanted it, they knew it was coming, and what they were talking about
                    was really implementing in the short term something that would carry them over
                    for they thought, at the most, 25 years. I think that their projection was to
                    gain a little bit of leeway. I think that we're now what, 14 years since that. I
                    think 20 is going to be enough to get them going on it. The real question was to
                    justify short wave. This was coming up.</p>
                <p>And you're right; the Voice is permeated. Certainly at that time it was permeated
                    by the idea that short wave was the way to go because what the basic reason,
                    rationale for the Voice of America was to reach those areas that did not have
                    access to objective news in times of crisis. Now probably that doesn't amount to
                    more than 10 percent of your receiving audience in the best of times. So if you
                    don't buy the rationale for the Voice that you're reaching in emergency
                    situations, then the Voice is a waste of money, because the rest of the 90
                    percent of it is fine. It's not fluff necessarily, but it's not that essential
                    either.</p>
                <p>What they found out, Haiti was a problem that we were facing even at that time,
                    was how to get your signal in. They looked at a square mile rock island in the
                    Caribbean between Jamaica and Cuba, which belongs to the U.S. This would have
                    meant setting up the transmitter on an island really only accessible by
                    helicopter. (Laughing) There is one place that you could land a small boat with
                    difficulty, but it was U.S. territory. I saw it one time from the air as I was
                    flying out of Jamaica. Haiti received no good VOA signal. As you mentioned
                    earlier, short wave is a bouncing effect, and it isn't really much good unless
                    you're a thousand miles away from the transmitter. Probably more foreign people
                    know about VOA than any other aspect of our government.</p>
                <p>Q: Were the locations a problem? People who were looking somewhat ahead were
                    seeing that you're really in a transition stage and so acquiring a lot of pieces
                    of property where the signal would bounce a thousand miles and hit the right
                    place...</p>
                <p>GOOD: Minimum of a thousand.</p>
                <p>Q: You want to get the proper skipping place, but the effort to get this
                    territory, would probably be obsolete within 20 years. This had an effect,
                    didn't it?</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>GOOD: It did, but, of course, if you're buying the rationale, as I mentioned
                    earlier that the reason for the whole Voice of America instrument is to reach
                    those areas in an emergency situation who don't have any other source of real
                    news, then it's worth the expense. Compared to the expenditures for the
                    military, of course, it's peanuts. Now we were working on projects in Botswana.
                    That one was already ongoing; I remember I had a check in my hand for $7,500,000
                    one day. I thought was the largest I'd ever have in my hand. It was moving along
                    quite well before I got there. We were just about ready to sign when I got on
                    the job. The seven and a half million as I remember was for the 25-year land
                    rent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Botswana reach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The Botswana signal was going north and northwest to be backup for the
                    French area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: French African area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: French African area. It'd be north of Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo)
                    we're talking, not anything south, except that at Selebi Phikwe, which is the
                    name of the site, they also had an FM station beaming down into apartheid South
                    Africa. That one was up and running first, of course. I remember when I got down
                    to South Africa in '90, I could listen to that one quite easily. But they wanted
                    to have the ability to reach anywhere from three directions, so that in case
                    something failed, they would have a backup. This was going north and northwest,
                    and it would also have the capacity, if necessary, to go the Indian route.</p>
                <p>Another one of our projects was to replace the old site, which had a very small
                    transmitter; it was a 35 kw (kilowatt) I think, in Sri Lanka. Charlie Wick had
                    fouled this one up. He focused on this after he got in. It was almost ready to
                    go. It was all negotiated, ready to sign, and he said, “No, I want to start from
                    scratch and review this.” Well by the time he got through reviewing, and it was
                    clear that what was ready was what they needed, the squatters had taken over
                    most of the site, and politically the local government wasn't going to be able
                    to kick them out. Now that has turned around, and I think they're back down
                    there with half the site and half the strength and all that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>We had temporarily been moved up into the mountains about 45 miles north of
                    Colombo in an area that was supposedly less likely to be invaded by squatters.
                    Yet the first thing we did was to put a fence, and really that's about all we
                    ever did get done on that site because we wanted to be, and this is another
                    characteristic of short wave broadcasting, by the sea, by salt water, not fresh
                    water. Fresh water absorbs the signal; salt water reflects it.</p>

                <p>GOOD: So it was better to be down there on the shore, which was where they had
                    originally been. Ultimately, shortly after I left the project and they started
                    to get some transmitters, then they had a bad fire while it was still under the
                    control of the contractor. So it wasn't something the Voice was responsible for.
                    Unfortunately, Bob, who was in charge of this, suffered career damage from the
                    way it was handled.</p>
                <p>There was another particular problem for Sri Lanka, the worries of India that
                    this was going to be broadcasting to India. It took some serious negotiations in
                    New Delhi to calm the Indian government down by pointing out to them that
                    technically this station was too close to India to be broadcast into India. This
                    station was broadcasting up into the interior of China, and I guess the “Stans”
                    (countries north of India whose name ended in S-T-A-N). To a certain extent,
                    that was one of their (concerns). They were aiming into two main directions,
                    into the hinterland of China and into the southern areas of Russia. The primary
                    location, however, was the hinterland of mainland Asia. A backup was to the
                    Stans, and then a third, if necessary, would be bouncing over toward Africa. But
                    that was just the third priority and not the very significant one. They had
                    problems witAmbassador Spain, a person who micromanaged. Great guy, but he read
                    everything, and he knew everything. He'd been around since when, 1950 or so? His
                    autobiography is excellent; I'm sure you've read it. But he drove the PAO nuts
                    (laughing) because he would pester him at night as he read the day's traffic.
                    Spain was not the only ambassador who had this habit. He wanted, as do many
                    ambassadors, to have control over every U.S. action going on in his country. We
                    thought as others have thought in other situations, that if you're not
                    technically qualified, you shouldn't second-guess where it has no policy
                    implication. Have your control over the policy side, but once the policy is
                    satisfied and you're implementing it, don't try to make decisions where you
                    aren't qualified.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Not at that time. We were too far south. There were latepolitical problems
                    of some sort on the hillside site.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Simply because I think the roads were unsafe at that time.But in '86 to '88
                    that was not a factor on that site.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>We had another project in Puerto Rico. Because it was U.S. territory, EPA
                    (Environmental Protection Agency) was involved, and that's even worse than the
                    Israelis who wanted to be satisfied that everything that we did was kosher and
                    nonobstructive to their purposes. We ultimately canceled the Puerto Rican
                    because, as we did the Israeli one, because it just wasn't feasible
                    bureaucratically. We had a site that probably satisfied them, but you could
                    never be sure. That would have been a backup site as I remember for Africa as
                    well as for South America.</p>
                <p>We had an interesting project in Belize. It was a non short wave station, FM
                    station, beaming into Nicaragua using a new antenna configuration, almost
                    experimental, but it definitely worked. It allowed them to be able to bounce it
                    almost like a short wave, after hours, it was an evening-night arrangement,
                    bouncing off the troposphere, coming back down to Managua. We couldn't get any
                    closer at that point.</p>
                <p>We did have a project up in Costa Rica in an area which I see since has been in
                    the news because the airfield has become, or at least was alleged to have been
                    involved with, drug trafficking, and it was bouncing down too. There we got into
                    some problems with frequencies, partly because of our strength. We were booming
                    out at 50,000, which is what would be a clear channel station in the old days in
                    the States. Many of the stations in Central America didn't have good crystals,
                    so that they were slopping off their frequencies. We'd get interference. But the
                    strength of our signal was such that even where they weren't slopping over, we
                    were interfering with on their frequency. Vera Cruz was the place that had a
                    frequency identical to ours, and even though that was on the backside of our
                    signal that it was beamed south and they were north, it still, they felt,
                    interfered with them. So this got into negotiations. We had a fellow who
                    specialized in on frequencies. He would go to the international meetings, and
                    he'd calm them down, and we satisfied them. We bought off individual stations by
                    providing them with new crystals in some cases. We agreed to cut our strength in
                    signal on certain hours so it wouldn't interfere with those farther north. It
                    was a great technical fun. They had a lot of fun in the Voice with this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>GOOD: I was monitoring. I was following the budget. I was in some cases traveling
                    to participate in the negotiations. I was definitely the third seat, not the
                    first or second. We spent several weeks at one time over in Jerusalem
                    negotiating with the Israelis on the site that ultimately ended up in Kuwait.
                    Although we'd spent at least $5,000,000 direct contribution, I call it bribery,
                    to get the site, Israel was very difficult because they had 19 ministries that
                    had to sign off on the plans for the site, ranging from military through
                    environmental. It was down in the Negev Desert. It involved the shift of the
                    main highway, movement of part of a town, and the military were concerned with
                    the same kind of problem we're having here now with these cellular phone towers.
                    People are worried about the envelope radiation. This was a factor we had to go
                    through then, trying to find the research. Dayton was dealing with this, of
                    course, in the Air Force. The Israeli Air Force particularly was worried that
                    the strength of the signals emanating from that tower, or those towers, would
                    interfere with the electronic box that their planes were operating on if the
                    planes went through that envelope at whatever altitude. Since the towers were
                    never put up there, we never knew whether they had any basis for their worries
                    or not. But if your electronics shut down in your jet airplane, you do have a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>The reason why we were in Israel was not because we wanted to be in Israel, but
                    because we couldn't find any other country in the area that would be willing to
                    take us. They tried, tried hard. Now after the Gulf War, we had a little more
                    leverage in Kuwait, and we got there, not in as lovely an infrastructure
                    arrangement as we were going to have in Israel, because we were going in there
                    quick and dirty, but with the same result. We had a location which we had the
                    cooperation of the local government. Again, of course, we weren't beaming to the
                    Arab world.</p>
                <p>This was the main idea that we had to get through the minds of the policymakers.
                    Short wave isn't local. Short wave isn't local. We're not even broadcasting in
                    the local language. Like with India, we weren't broadcasting in the Indian
                    languages. We weren't broadcasting in Arabic from the Middle East sites. To
                    broadcast into the Middle East or India, we would have to back up at least as
                    far as Morocco, which was another one of our sites. We had had a site there for
                    years, one of our older sites. We were replacing it. It's located just south of
                    Tangier in what we had been told was a lake. Now I wasn't there; I got this
                    story from engineering. Wick went out there with his chief engineer, and Wick
                    said, “I want the station there.” And he pointed at the spot. And they said to
                    him, “Mr. Wick, that's not a good idea, because that's a lake in the rainy
                    season. “No,” he says, “I want it there.” So the ultimate result of this was
                    that we had to buy a hill, and use that hill to construct islands in the lake,
                    to build the causeway to get out to the station from the main highway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just, did Wick have any rationale behind this, or
                        wathis?</hi>

                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>GOOD: No, he liked it. He liked that location. It made no sense. The site came on
                    line when I was in Morocco in '91, the VOA director came out and dedicated the
                    site. One of the clauses on that is that if the king of Morocco is traveling to
                    the States, the Voice of America if asked, is compelled to shift its antennas so
                    that they can broadcast the Radio of Morocco to the king in New York. That's one
                    of those clauses; they wrote that in there. We way overpaid on that site, that's
                    the only classified agreement we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Charlie Wick? What was your impression of his
                        efforts,vis-�-vis the Voice of America during the time you were doing this
                        job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He had calmed down from what he was reported to have been like in the early
                    '80s by the time I got there. My opinion of his efforts is based more upon how
                    we saw it in the field. In retrospect, I think that he did a great deal of good
                    in getting the agency involved in upgrading its technical capacities, not only
                    at the Voice, but in the field with the wireless file, and the World Net, the
                    dishes, and so forth. These were tools; they were not anything more than
                    programming accessories. But World Net was a good tool. He had a very jovial
                    presence. Of course, he had a personality problem, an attitude problem. He
                    didn't want to have anyone around him who was very much taller than he. So it
                    was a hard period for the tall agency officers.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Morton was of his height, so Mort didn't have troubles with him. Charlie
                    was Jewish, and Mort was Jewish, so that was another link. So we were somewhat
                    protected in our little office there at the Voice.</p>
                <p>To step away from the project for a moment, I found it very interesting to be a
                    part of the Voice of America and yet not being a part of the programming part of
                    the Voice, which of course is what it's mainly all about. I wasn't emotionally
                    involved in any of the fights. I was dealing with the technical, the engineering
                    side, mostly. I had friends in the programming areas. But I would be the person
                    who was on their side because I was working in the building, but I wasn't
                    someone that needed to be manipulated because I wasn't involved in their policy
                    problems on a daily basis. So I could observe, almost like being a Foreign
                    Service officer in a foreign country during an election. You can be objective;
                    you can watch it and enjoy it without being crushed bywhatever the result is. Of
                    course, the Voice of America is a foreign country in many ways. Its
                    representatives from all over the world are there, and they are, in the main,
                    ultimately American citizens because they've been there quite awhile, but
                    they're still not greatly assimilated in many of their attitudes toward the
                    kinds of a moral or a societal norm that we have, that our children would
                    be.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, it's more than that though, Stu. It's that these people were
                    ideologically and intellectually involved in the political morass of wherever
                    they came from, which is why they came. They were opposition forces usually. One
                    of the problems the Voice has had over the years is to corral those people from
                    putting into their production tapes, points of view, which are not in line with
                    the U.S. policy. It's hard to monitor them, because there's a lot of production
                    going on in lots of languages of which we don't have a lot of Americans who have
                    all those languages overseas. So we're often dependent upon reports back which
                    are zingers coming back from the embassies overseas, “Did you hear this on your
                    program yesterday? Cut this out!”</p>
                <p>But it was like a small village as well because there were cliques all over the
                    place. The Russians versus the Lithuanians, I got in trouble on that. One of my
                    neighbors in McLean was a Lithuanian. The Lithuanian branch was under the
                    Russian section. I went down looking for her one day; I needed to tell her
                    something. I made the mistake of going to a friend of mine who was a Russian, a
                    deputy director of that area I guess. My neighbor never spoke to me again. I had
                    given the impression that I was lumping Lithuania under Russia.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: And no, I'm sorry, that's not the way it goes folks. They were opposed in
                    the main to whatever government that was in charge at the time they left. Since
                    most of those governments in the case of the Eastern Bloc were still the same
                    governments, they were continuing to be anti. Of course they're in a time lock.
                    It's like the Americans who left during the Vietnam period and let's say went to
                    Southeast Asia or went to Australia to teach. Their memories, their feeling,
                    their reaction to the United States policy remains as it was when they left.
                    They hadn't noted the change. When I would talk with the Americans in Australia
                    on occasion about for example the military, about how conservative the military
                    is, how uninterested in triggering wars and doing these awful things that they
                    were accusing the U.S. of, they found it hard to believe.</p>

                    Yugoslavia, who were shivering and quivering about going in. They had a van that
                    they were going to use to go on vacation. They were Croat offspring from people
                    in Los Angeles. I said, “Look, (laughing) they're not out after you. You weren't
                    born here, you aren't Yugoslav, and you aren't Croatian. If you are worried, go
                    down to the consulate and register. But you haven't done anything; they're not
                    after you; you're an American citizen; forget it!”</p>
                <p>But the building, before I forget, I want to tell you that the building that the
                    Voice of America is in is a wonderful building. It's got I think the original,
                    the first escalators that were installed in Washington there with nice golden
                    bronze covers. Of course it's difficult to keep them running; they're often
                    down. Bathrooms, twice as many as you need because it was built for segregation.
                    Wide corridors. It's got space. Although it's of course an old building and some
                    of the air ducts aren't in the greatest shape and some of the air conditioning
                    may not be working all that well in certain areas, the windows do open.</p>
                <p>Q: By the way, you mentioned that you were pointed towards countries in crises.
                    Was this a key word for saying we're talking about countries that were in a
                    communist bloc? I mean, was that what it was?</p>
                <p>GOOD: No, it wasn't just a communist bloc. It's whenever you have an overthrow of
                    a government, and the radio stations are not able to provide the kinds of
                    objective information distribution that you would normally have. Of course, the
                    Eastern Bloc was a continuing problem, but you had Haiti as I mentioned. If you
                    had a change of government in Africa, you'd want to be able to get the news of
                    what's going on and how that event was being portrayed outside the country. So
                    the crises could be anywhere, and there were. Chile, for example, when Allende
                    was overthrown, problems in Argentina, Brazil, wherever. They wanted to be able
                    to make sure that they got our story in and as objective a version of what was
                    going on outside of our policy fields.</p>
                <p>The policy question at the Voice was, of course, always there. Just down the hall
                    from our offices was the editorial room, which is in close communication with
                    State and dealt with the editorials that were broadcast and identified as
                    editorials. Now the criticism has been that the news broadcasting from the Voice
                    was also laden with editorial comment. I suppose that's true with any news
                    organization. You've got some spin direction that you're doing. But if you
                    listen to the editorials and you listened to the news, it was clear that they
                    were coming from two different sources usually. There was an axe to grind on the
                    editorial side. That grind direction was generally steered by State. Obviously,
                    this was the reason that there was a successful push to keep the Voice of
                    America out of the merger with State to set up a separate agency, so that there
                    would not be as easy an argument to make that the policy wonks were controlling
                    the news.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. You left there in 1988 and whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Whither? Went up to Toronto for a couple of weeks and had great fun. Went
                    up as a part of the team that was setting up the Economic Summit, the last one
                    that Reagan went to. Stayed in the Royal York Hotel. We took it over mostly. It
                    was in June. Since most of my job was going to be following the conference
                    rather than involved in the conference, a State officer and I made great use of
                    the free transportation tickets that we were given for the public transportation
                    around Toronto and enjoyed ourselves. That's the only time I actually was
                    involved with Wick directly. He came up to see how things were going. Pat
                    Kennedy was the executive officer for the session, did a marvelous job, very
                    impressive. He was still young then.</p>
                <p>But I was aiming again for overseas, and I decided to try again that job that I'd
                    had earlier in Africa. They were desperately looking for someone with
                    administrative background to do the trouble shooting for South Asia-Middle East.
                    So I shifted over to the M Bureau (Management Bureau) to travel the Middle East
                    out of Washington. I did that for two years, covering North Africa, Middle East,
                    and South Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's '88 to '90?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: '88 to '90. Unlike State, we, PMOs (Post Management Systems Officer) was
                    what we were called, traveled 50 percent of the time outside the country. Here
                    your PMOs in State probably do a trip a year at most, dealing mostly long
                    distance with the problems. Same kind of a responsibility, find out what the
                    problems were, solve them, can't solve them, bring them back, and try to get
                    them resolved back in Washington, negotiate with the embassy because most of our
                    PAOs aren't administratively savvy or interested or willing to admit that they
                    were savvy. If you were going to admit to some management expertise, it could
                    hurt your career as a programmer. I found that out personally. We had one
                    certainly very savvy PAO in the Middle East, who we talked about it; he was
                    aware of this. He kept his managerial talents under very heavy curtain. His post
                    worked very well. Didn't have to do much for him because he knew how to do it,
                    but he didn't want people back in the area office to understand how good he was.
                    So I covered every post at least twice a year and many of them every three
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the major issues you had to deal
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>GOOD: Probably the most normal one was a fight going on with the admin section
                    between the PAO and the admin section. The admin section wanted something,
                    wanted USIS to do something that the PAO didn't want to do, or didn't understand
                    how to do, or didn't understand why he should do it. There were personnel
                    problems. As an administrator you're aware, making sure that they've got their
                    job descriptions up-to-date. It's minutia in a way, but if they don't keep it
                    up, in the long run, the employees suffered, and the post doesn't work as well.
                    It was finding out how their budgets were going, occasionally getting involved
                    with embassy stuff, but not very often; mostly it was in-house.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that with the departure of Charlie Wick when the Reagan
                    administration went out that some of the clout of USIA went with it?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Oh, yes, because we got a very bad successor who just didn'understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Bruce S. Gelb. He was that fellow from up in Connecticut, Proctor and
                    Gamble? He got into a major fight with Dick Carlson who was the director of the
                    Voice while I was there, who if I haven't mentioned it somewhere along the line,
                    I should, a marvelous administrator. He went on to be head of Corporation for
                    Public Broadcasting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: A wonderful person to work for. He was in charge; the staff admired him; he
                    was professionally competent and politically astute. When he got into a fight
                    with the director of the agency, the result was that they were both canned, if
                    you will, politically. He went off to the Seychelles as an ambassador, and the
                    other guy went off to Brussels, I think. And that was the end of the director of
                    the agency. The former ambassador to London, I believe, succeeded him, Henry
                    something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Henry Catto.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Catto, right, who had been the press spokesman for Weinberger at the
                    Defense Department. When I was in Australia, he came out, a very competent guy.
                    He knew his stuff. He wasn't there that long because he was toward the end of
                    Bush's time, didn't have all that long of a period.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>But aside from him, after Wick left, now Wick, Wick was active; he was full of
                    energy; he had the connections through his wife with the White House. He was not
                    all that sophisticated about what our mission was overseas. He didn't really
                    have that much of an interest in the postings overseas as to what we were doing.
                    But then after him, nobody did either, except Catto, to a certain extent, but he
                    wasn't there long.</p>
                <p>As soon as we got into Duffey, it was lost. He just didn't know what we were
                    doing. His interest was in running the operation there in Washington for
                    whatever he thought it was supposed to be doing. His deputy was very narrow,
                    narrowly interested and focused. So the direction from Washington just wasn't
                    there anymore above the associate director level for the regions. But that was
                    not a real concern for me as an administrator during the '88 to '90 period when
                    I was a PMAO for at least South Asia, Northern Africa. It didn't come back into
                    focus until I got back overseas. Then it began to be a problem. Certainly when I
                    got to Morocco, it was downhill from then on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, while you were in this management side, when
                        did yogo there, in 1990?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well I went in '88 to the PMAO job and spent two years traveling. So I
                    spent a full year outside the country. I was, and I'll get to that later, asked
                    to go back to the job after Morocco. I said, “ I would, on condition that you
                    base me overseas.” The primary reason for that was the jet lag problem of this
                    constant travel. I just didn't want the transatlantic flights any longer. It's
                    too long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: My trips were normally six weeks long, of which one full week was spent in
                    travel status, that is, flying, sitting in airports, and getting off planes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: It's fun for a while, and fun for a little longer if you're at a new area.
                    But a year of learning your area takes the edge off the exoticism. There are
                    still spots of interest, of course, logistically. But there are more spots where
                    the trouble is not worth the excitement any longer. So I said I would only take
                    it on that condition.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>It was very interesting for my first tour of two years traveling. It was areas
                    that I had not been in before. I had not been in the Middle East before, except
                    to Israel when I was in the Voice. I hadn't been in the Gulf. I had been in
                    Calcutta and in Madras, but I hadn't been in New Delhi; I hadn't been in Nepal;
                    I hadn't been in Syria, of course; I hadn't been in Algeria, hadn't been in
                    Tunisia; so it was areas that I found very interesting for those two years.</p>
                <p>Because I had both the programming background and the administrative background,
                    I had better rapport with the PAOs than most of the administrative travelers
                    had. They had not gone through the information and cultural tours that I'd had.
                    The PAO welcomed me in as his peer, and I could get things done a lot more
                    smoothly. I didn't stay very long in any one place. Again, this is my preference
                    maximum three days unless there's some major project.</p>
                <p>I did have one major project in Khartoum. We had to completely revamp the office.
                    I fired 49 people and hired back seven, I think it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They had an English teaching program, and it was Washington's decision that
                    they not have it any longer. They also didn't like the place that they were
                    located. They felt that it was dump. It was a separate, single house. They
                    decided they wanted to downsize; they wanted to cut the circulation library out,
                    make it a reading room, put it down near the government offices, which is what
                    they felt their major customers were to be; and it ended up in a major office
                    building downtown near the river. It meant negotiation with the Ministry of
                    Labor to make sure that they didn't come back and say that we had broken their
                    labor laws. As you well know, most of these developing countries have a good set
                    of European based labor laws. We were clean, because we really were shutting up
                    and reopening elsewhere in a downsized location, and we were canceling programs.
                    So we didn't have any problems with the government.</p>
                <p>Khartoum was one of those places that never did lose its charm for me. I liked
                    Khartoum. I like the Sudanese. They're marvelous people, friendly, gentle,
                    pleasant. I only was threatened with arrest once. There were rules, of course.
                    They had almost put the DCM under house arrest a few days before. They almost
                    arrested me over a question of photography.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They were very tight on that. Travel outside the city required a special
                    permit that you had to be there a couple of weeks in order to get a hold of. But
                    I was able there to join an embassy expedition one weekend to go down to the
                    cataracts on the Nile, cross the desert down to the cataracts.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>On another expedition, we drove south to an island on the Nile River devoted to
                    cotton raising. To get a bit of a view of how different it had been under the
                    English administration, it had really been a garden spot down there then. They
                    had built up well, they had organized well, they had something going for them,
                    and so the infrastructure was still there. But it was decaying rapidly, as you
                    would find in, let's say Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>I didn't get tired of Khartoum. The weather is wild; the heat is amazing; the
                    confluence of the White and the Blue Niles is interesting; the town is not a
                    part of the modern world. The airport is isolated. You fly in from Addis Ababa,
                    for example, and you're in another part of the world, a long ways from
                    anywhere.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were doing this, how did you see or feel that the effectiveness of
                    USIA efforts were continuing at about the same level, because it's the beginning
                    of time that we were beginning to feel tucks in various ends?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, the resources were down. In the smaller posts you were pretty well
                    down to a little bit of exchange work and the personal efforts of contact by the
                    PAO and his staff. You didn't have money, and it was that the real budget was
                    lowering because of inflation. We weren't getting the increases.</p>
                <p>The effectiveness, the utility of having a USIS was, of course, still there. USIS
                    has the broadest contacts in an embassy; they know most everybody that anybody
                    else knows, and they can get action because they know where to go. They've got
                    the media. The media is their main focus with the universities. When the embassy
                    needs something in the area of publicity, they're there. When you need something
                    in the area of education, they're there. There's nobody else in the embassy that
                    can do it just like nobody else can do the economic officer's job and a
                    political officer's job. It's part of the team, and it works very well.</p>
                <p>We had good staffs, despite State's feeling that we over graded them at times. We
                    were hiring good news staff as opposed to some of the other countries. What we'd
                    originally had at the time of independence, a very small pool to draw upon, now
                    we had much better qualified people, and we were hiring or replacing the good
                    people. As they leave going into areas of the government, we then, of course,
                    picked up quality level, in effect, policymakers in the government that we had
                    contact with. Unlike most of the rest of the embassies, people don't have
                    anywhere to go once they leave the embassy, so they don't leave. Our people, our
                    public, our cultural officers, our cultural assistants, and our information
                    assistants are nowadays, university educated. Their buddies are teachers,
                    university or programmers in the media. They're plugged in, and when they leave
                    they are also plugged in. It's very impressive.</p>

                <p>GOOD: I went to South Africa as exec (executive) officer for USIS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in South Africa from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: '90 to '92, and I left only because they asked if I would help them out in
                    Morocco. They pulled the PAO and the exec out for discipline if you will. They
                    said that they had mismanaged. Now that was a large fight, which I wasn't
                    personally involved with, but the PAO had been a classmate of mine, back in '63
                    when we came in, and the exec officer had helped train me when I first was a PMA
                    back in '76. So I knew them both well. There was a lot of politics between the
                    area director in Washington and the ambassador at the post. The result was that
                    they needed replacements for the management team. I had wanted to get into a
                    Muslim country just to have the exposure to a different culture and had planned
                    to go up there in '93. But they asked if I would be willing to go a year early.
                    I said, “Okay, I'm not sure whether I'll grab it up,” because we loved South
                    Africa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things were really beginning to change, were they

                <p>GOOD: They were. Mandela had been released in April. I got there in August.
                    Although he wasn't in power, of course, until just after I left in '92, the
                    apartheid was changing. The misogynous laws were disappearing, and the
                    restrictions on where you could live were being lifted while I was there.
                    Because of the nature of my job and the fact that we had branch posts in Durban
                    and Cape Town and Johannesburg, I could get around a bit and see the country.
                    Even without business reasons for travel, it's easy to travel, or was easy to
                    travel in South Africa. The roads are excellent because they were built to
                    military standards to be able to move around the country well. I found myself an
                    old BMW 728, which weighed like a tank and drove like a dream. You could sail
                    along at 100 miles an hour with no traffic on an excellent road and feel like
                    you were just really living well. So we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>We took a trip just before we left, up to Victoria Falls, by car, came back down,
                    went up to Botswana, came back down through Zimbabwe, stopped at Selebi Phikwe
                    to see the staff there, overnighted, and of course got down to Cape Town on
                    vacation, got down to Durban on vacation, went over to Swaziland a few times,
                    got down to the Kruger Park. Johannesburg was in the back yard of course, got
                    down there regularly. We had a sub post at Soweto. We had a new office that I
                    had to get involved, negotiate, get it built in Johannesburg, to move the office
                    from one site to another. I'd go for a vacation in Hogsback, which is down just
                    above Ciskei, halfway down toward the Cape, overlooking the escarpment, which
                    then goes down to the Indian Ocean. It's a great place. It's high enough that
                    it'll get some snow in the winter. It's got a nice little hotel.</p>
                <p>But South Africa is hopeless. There's no way that the country's going to improve
                    now. I was back down there last year, and no. There's no cohesion. Only in the
                    Embassy did the groups or representatives from all the major tribes work
                    together.</p>
                <p>When I say tribes I don't mean to be bigoted. I realize that there are those who
                    say that you shouldn't use the word “tribe” and I can see why. There's a book
                    coming I just read recently, Mistaken Africa is the title of it. A fellow who
                    teaches African history in a small college up in, I think, Pennsylvania, says
                    that “tribes” provides a certain picture here in the United States that isn't
                    accurate. He's right of course, but the Africans still speak of tribes. So I
                    include the British as a tribe, I include the Boers as a tribe, just as I would
                    consider the Sothos or the Xhosas or anyone else as a tribe.</p>
                <p>They would work together in the office smoothly, but they didn't socialize
                    outside the office. If you went to socialize with one of them outside the
                    office, you were going into their group. You weren't bringing anybody else along
                    with you. You were an American, a visitor, a diplomat who was outside, as you
                    know, outside the fold, and therefore welcome because even if they made a
                    mistake about you, you were gone in a couple of years anyway.</p>
                <p>We had lots of good friends. We enjoyed it very much. My wife did a year at
                    Witwatersrand, graduate work in simultaneous and consecutive translation work.
                    My son had some problems and almost shattered his right arm completely in a
                    cricket problem at the school. Some fat guy fell on him when his arm was in a
                    bad position, and almost, it was completely loose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: That was, I think, the second worse personal experience I've ever had,
                    sitting there with him that weekend while they waited to see if they would, how
                    they would, operate. Total pain; they couldn't give him enough painkillers.
                    That's one time I did use my diplomatic status to tell them to “get out of my
                    face, and I'm going to stay here. I don't care what your rules are,” because he
                    needed support. He still doesn't have full radius of movement on the right
                    arm.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: So that was a real downer. It disrupted my wife's schooling. From that
                    point, she had to take care of him then, to get him physical therapy for a
                    year.</p>
                <p>The local school was fine. It was much better than the American school. We tried
                    him in the American school. It started in August, and in November we pulled him
                    out. The teacher was unqualified. We were justified, but it took a year to get
                    the justification. I went for a classroom visit after having corresponded with
                    her for a couple of weeks. She was the wife of the principal. I corresponded
                    with her on various problems that my son would bring home in his homework. So I
                    went in to observe as we were invited to do, although that time the principal
                    said, “I can't let you go in alone. I have to get somebody else to go with you,
                    because I don't trust you. I think you're out to get her.” She was unqualified.
                    A year later, my buddy who was on the school board, said, “You were right. She
                    didn't have the qualifications.” She not only didn't have the guidance
                    credentials that her husband had said she had, but she didn't even have teaching
                    credentials. There were misspelled words on the board, on the signs that she had
                    hanging in the room. So I pulled him out and put him into a local school, not a
                    boarding school, but a day school, a private school, which was far more
                    integrated than the American school was. I moved him to the school in Pretoria,
                    which saved him having to do that daily to and fro to the school, which as I
                    said was closer to Johannesburg. They were driven in Volkswagen vans on these
                    good roads at high speeds with drivers who were having to get up early in the
                    morning, something like five, to go to where the buses were parked, take the
                    buses to get the kids, and they had to take the buses back, then do the same
                    thing in the evenings, and then have to get home after that. They were tired.
                    Sometimes, not frequently, but on occasion, some of the mothers would just take
                    the driver off the bus and say, “Now you stay here and sleep, and I will
                    continue your run,” because he was falling asleep. They should have had some way
                    that they could have taken the vehicles back to where they were at night, rather
                    than having to leave them at a central location. It was an isolated school in
                    the countryside away from any public transportation. It had been a stable
                    originally, and they bought it up.</p>
                <p>I didn't agree with whippings, which they still had. It was illegal in the public
                    schools, but it was not yet illegal in the private schools, and these were. It
                    was British tradition. Although it was illegal at that point already in England,
                    it was not yet dug out of the minds of these people who had been raised in the
                    '50s and '60s as students in that tradition.</p>
                <p>The headmaster was a fine fellow, had come down from Zimbabwe, a white who led
                    the black takeover. The facilities were fine; the teachers were very, very
                    interested in the children, so much better than the ones at the American school,
                    who were really those who hadn't fitted in anywhere else.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>There was a problem, which coincided with my withdrawal of my son from the
                    school. My wife had agreed to go out and teach Spanish. She had Afrikaans
                    fluently, and of course, Spanish, and Portuguese, and others. She knew what was
                    going on in both the English speaking side and the Afrikaans side. There were
                    some Afrikaans teachers there. At the same time she quit, actually she was fired
                    because she refused to go to a conference down in Lesotho. She said that money
                    should better go to provide some lockers for these kids who have no place to put
                    their stuff here at the school. So the principal fired her. The ambassador asked
                    if we would please not make a fuss, although we turned out to be right, and I'll
                    get to that in a minute. He said, “I'm trying to keep things under control
                    there, so that there won't be a bad reputation at the school and that the people
                    who are coming out as businessmen will know that there is a place they can put
                    their kids.” Now the businessmen are too smart to be worried about that. When
                    they did come out, they put their kids into other very good private schools that
                    were up in Johannesburg.</p>
                <p>But I had been skeptical because the principal had bent my ear one day at the
                    office by phone for 30 minutes trying to convince me to go in with him investing
                    in gold shares. Yes. The RMO (Regional Medical Officer), who had been placed as
                    the chairman of the board by the ambassador, Paul was interestingly ambitious.
                    He was not focused so much on his medicine, although he was a good doctor. He
                    was into photography; he was getting himself qualified locally; of course he was
                    traveling; and he was very much involved in the politics of the school. I said,
                    “There's something fishy here.” And the administrative officer said, “There's
                    something fishy here,” but he couldn't for the same reason that the ambassador
                    had asked me to back off after my wife was canned. The Ambassador told the admin
                    officer, “Please don't make any waves here.” I'm convinced that that's one of
                    the reasons that he committed suicide a few weeks later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The administrative officer. Now that's my spin on what happened. Not
                    everyone agrees with me, but he certainly decapitated himself on a day when
                    there was no reason that he should have had this accident, clear road, dry, no
                    traffic, and he ran his motorcycle into a pole. But in any event, he and I were
                    in agreement on the fact there was a problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>The reason that I feel justified in believing there was is that a year later they
                    fired the principal for unspecified activities. Now at the time, as I said my
                    wife left, the business manager also left specifically because she could no
                    longer morally work with a fellow who was making the kinds of decisions with
                    money that the principal was making. Now the RMO a few years later, when I was
                    in Morocco, was found with his hand in the cookie jar in Moscow and was canned
                    from the Foreign Service, lost his pension under bargaining. He was told, “You
                    will lose your pension and no longer be able to have a job with the U.S.
                    government. In return for that agreement, we will not prosecute you.” I think he
                    had walked off with $5,000 on false vouchers. And this was the feeling that I
                    had. As a person, nice guy, lovely wife, good entertainer, but he just was
                    dirty. And he and the principal were, obviously, in my opinion and my wife's
                    opinion, and her opinion was based upon what she saw at the school and what the
                    Afrikaans-speaking staff was seeing. The principal was dirty too. His wife was
                    unqualified. We were better off out of there. Of course, the side effect of this
                    was that my son gained a year of school. When we pulled him out of fourth grade
                    and put him into the local school, there as a three month gap. During the
                    interim, I put him on Calvert, geared him up, and in January he entered the
                    fifth grade.</p>
                <p>Q: The Calvert system?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Calvert is the correspondence system out of Baltimore, which I'd had for
                    first grade, and which I had my other eldest son in Thailand on first grade. I
                    continued Mark on Calvert throughout his time in South Africa in social science
                    and in math because I wanted him to remember the decimals versus the commas, and
                    I wanted him to be kept current on where he should be in American history and
                    geography. He still of course is more comfortable in the metric system than he
                    is in the U.S., but he understands the U.S. of course. He had a very good
                    educational time there I thought.</p>
                <p>We had a very interesting time there. We had good friends in the Afrikaans
                    community, no particular reason other than that's where the embassy housed us.
                    We still have good friends from there. I was back there, had dinner with my
                    neighbor when I was traveling last year in Pretoria for my job. We get calls
                    from the people who had owned the house and built the house originally, had
                    moved up a few doors on the same street, even now, and email contact.</p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>But it was a place of paranoia, if you will. The reason we had R &amp; R out of
                    South Africa was because of the psychological pressure. It was not because of
                    the climate certainly. You could argue maybe on distance, but that's not
                    unusual. We had no differential, but we had R and R because we were watched. I
                    know my wife was followed for several months after we got there, tailed until
                    she finally complained, and the boss backed off. We learned later that they
                    never did believe that she wasn't working for the CIA. The South African station
                    chief in Morocco was a good friend of ours, and she remained unconvinced. Her
                    husband, their ambassador was never convinced that she was not because she's so
                    good at contacts. That's just her forte. They couldn't imagine why anybody would
                    be bothering with developing that kind of network if they didn't have an
                    ulterior motive. But it did get us a lot of friends and a lot of contacts.</p>
                <p>Q: While you were there, were you seeing a change in the society, getting ready
                    for the end of apartheid?</p>
                <p>GOOD: Oh, yes. You'd listen to the various groups. The Afrikaners were
                    apprehensive, of course. The British or the non-Boer white, non-Portuguese were
                    apprehensive. The Portuguese, of course, were naturally apprehensive because
                    most of them had come down from Angola or Mozambique following the revolutions
                    and change of governments independence there. So their discomfort was really not
                    related to the changes that were coming. Their problems were ongoing, finding a
                    niche in the community that they had come to. But they were very separate. They
                    were into music, and they were into restaurants, and they lived in their areas.
                    But it was the Afrikaners who were most apprehensive. We didn't have many Zulus
                    working for us. The question of how they were going to integrate was certainly
                    on everyone's mind.</p>
                <p>The cultural officer, a superb officer, his wife was South African, they'd had to
                    leave when he married her on a previous tour, and with her connections, he had
                    connections everywhere. He was a natural net worker. He did not have fluent
                    Afrikaans, but he could get along. That was, of course, a problem in the office
                    because his contacts were miles ahead of the PAO's. The PAO had to piggyback at
                    best. As a result, the PAO, who didn't like the CAO's personality particularly
                    either, and CAO just didn't get along. I would frequently have to communicate
                    between them; they wouldn't talk to each other. The CAO was a marvelous fellow
                    in programming. He could get money for programs from the banks; he could get
                    sponsorship for this; he knew the leading intellectuals all over the country; he
                    was just plugged in because his wife had come from a mixed background. Her
                    family had been originally educated and sponsored by the Moravian mission down
                    near Cape Town which had a large reservation there for a couple of hundred
                    years. They treated their people equally; they educated them; her mother was a
                    principal of a school in Johannesburg; her brother was a doctor, etc. So she had
                    intellectual connections from generations back.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>So, as I say, we had a lot of interesting connections, and so we were plugged
                    into the worries that were going on in a lot of the different elements. My clerk
                    is presently the mayor of Pretoria. She retired from USIS after I left. It
                    turned out she was a neighborhood organizer type from Transkei, chubby, stocky,
                    happy, wonderful person. When two elements in Pretoria, after the apartheid
                    takeover, after Mandela took over, couldn't agree on either of their candidates,
                    she became the compromise candidate and is still there. (Laughing) Wonderful.
                    She's had to postpone her retirement in Transkei, where she had already gotten
                    her small house built.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left South Africa when, in '92 was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: In '92, August of '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were brought up, too, because of the problem up
                        iMorocco?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, and unfortunately I should have known better, but we were still
                    suffering communications problems with any other country outside South Africa.
                    So you really had difficulty, if you could get through, in talking with anyone
                    in Morocco. So I didn't know that they had been moved to an R and R status.</p>
                <p>As you may remember, at the time of the Gulf War in '91, January of '91, they
                    evacuated lots of people, in the Middle East, of course. Morocco was the only
                    place that didn't have R and R. Well, in effect, this was an R &amp; R. They
                    were getting my evacuation. After the fact, they decided just to continue with
                    that and lump it in as an R &amp; R. I didn't know that. I had been planning to
                    do an R &amp; R in Colombia that summer, prepared to go back home. We could have
                    done it; we had the tickets ready to go and everything. Then because I was
                    shifting and wouldn't have my R and R, I thought, we just transferred directly,
                    through Paris, had a good time with friends in Paris, then came on down to
                    Morocco. We had sent our employee, our Colombian employee that we had with us,
                    ahead. By the time we got to Morocco, they'd already subverted him, not with his
                    conscious knowledge. The gardeners and the lower member staff at USIS had
                    decided to have some fun with him and fed him hashish. He was, obviously,
                    vulnerable. He was Colombian, and the Moroccan government was looking for proof
                    that they could wave as, “we're serious about cutting the drug traffic.” Of
                    course, they didn't want to bother any of their own people, so they were looking
                    around for others. So we got him out of there immediately, sent him back to
                    Colombia, and did without help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sent him back to Colombia then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Excuse me, I sent him back to Colombia. He and his brother had been with us
                    for years. They had worked for the family in Bogota for years before that.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>So we arrived in Morocco in August to find the PAO, of course, gone, and the exec
                    had just left. It was a mess. The acting PAO was the CAO, and they forced him
                    out by mid-September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who forced him out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Washington, because they said he had to retire. He was TICed Time in class.
                    He should have been kept until the PAO came down. It turned out the PAO never
                    came because he was unable to get medical clearance. He was Christian Science
                    and had a problem, and he wouldn't take the medical. He still now looks like
                    death warmed over. I don't see how he manages to subsist; he's skin and bones.
                    He was still working when I retired. Lovely fellow, I'd met him when he was PAO
                    in Jordan, had just gotten his Ph.D., lovely wife, lots of kids. USIS had to go
                    find a new PAO. So we went from the active PAO, who ended up was TICed, to the
                    IO (Information Officer) acting, who then left on home leave. That defaulted to
                    the new CAO, who knew nothing about administration. So no decisions could be
                    made to clean up what was a mess that we had been sent there to clean up. It
                    wasn't until the PAO finally arrived in December, having been axed out of a
                    deputy job in London when they canceled the position, that we were really able
                    to get moving. Morale was the worst I'd ever seen. When I got there, the
                    infrastructure, the plant was bad, morale was bad, some of the problem people
                    had been fired already. I had to get involved in firing a few more, firing by
                    not renewing a contract.</p>
                <p>In one case, we had to fire the fellow because we caught him stealing. In fact,
                    we caught him stealing twice. He'd stolen once before I got there. He got his
                    wife to sign for a paycheck for a girl who was on a training mission, on
                    exchange training in Washington. When she came back, she went, “Where's my
                    paycheck?” Well, he'd already cashed it; we got proof of that from Patis. He was
                    the dispatcher for the motor pool. He'd stolen some POL, which we had proof of.
                    When we fired him, he never did understand what he'd done. He said, “All she had
                    to do was ask me for the money back,” in the case of the stolen paycheck. “It
                    wasn't much money anyway; why would she do that to me?”</p>
                <p>He was nothing but trouble from there on, because his wife still worked for us.
                    She wanted to divorce, and with the changing laws, it was possible,
                    theoretically, for a wife to sue for a divorce. She never made it while I was
                    there. Last I heard she still hadn't made it. She left the country. She's
                    working here with the Saudi embassy in Washington, had to leave her daughter,
                    and can't go back to Morocco. For all the time I was there, she was under court
                    order to give up the kids, but the order was held, because he hadn't yet paid
                    what he owed in child support. So it was a standoff, but she was unable to push
                    through the old boy network that he had in the police force to get this worked
                    through the judge at court. He'd sometimes harass her when she left the grounds
                    at night. Unfortunately, of course, there were people in the office, male
                    employees, who certainly agreed with him. So you had most of the women agreeing
                    with her, and most of the men agreeing with him. I had a real education on the
                    Moroccan gender standards.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I was exec again. We only had one branch post there in Casablanca, but that
                    was our larger operation from a programming point of view.</p>
                <p>But again, Morocco was wonderful. Unfortunately I didn't have French, because
                    having been shifted up there, it didn't give me any time to get any French. I
                    didn't have French until after I left Morocco before Senegal. But because my
                    wife had Afrikaans in South Africa, we were fine. She had marvelous French for
                    Morocco. She's got the languages, and so she immediately stepped into the higher
                    society in Morocco. We immediately had contacts at the ministry level, which had
                    nothing to do with my job, but it meant that I would show up at places where
                    only the ambassador was representing the American embassy. He'd look at me with,
                    “What are you doing here?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Marc Ginsburg, political. Actually, when I first got there Frederick
                    Vreeland was Ambassador. He was the son of the editor of Vogue, had been a CIA
                    officer for most of his career, and went to work for State as a deputy assistant
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>GOOD: He was good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: He'd had to marry his mistress before he got sworn in here. She was
                    interesting, an artistic type. The residence was interestingly decorated
                    (laughing). But he was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Dick Jackson there at the time or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: No, he'd left. He had been there forever. Q: Yes, yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>GOOD: He had been very good, but, no, he had left. He was still echoing around
                    the halls, but he had gone. So Joan Plaisted came in. She was the DCM, and she
                    was the charge for a while until they could get Ginsburg out there. Ginsburg, of
                    course, was hot to trot and without any clue as to how to trot as an ambassador,
                    almost instantly alienated the foreign minister to the point where we had to
                    back door our contacts. I remember my wife was working for the minister of
                    finance when they had a World Bank visit, and the minister of finance, gritting
                    his teeth as he told my wife and said, “All right, you know, I've got to have
                    the ambassador over when we have lunch with the World Bank people.” He said, “I
                    really don't want to.” He did, but that was the only time. Marc had a way with
                    the locals, which got him termed “the Israeli ambassador to Morocco.” However he
                    meant that to be, he got that taint, and it didn't help at all. He had thought
                    that he was going to be able to resolve the Western Sahara problem because of
                    course he could do that; he was very good. He wasn't very good, and he couldn't
                    resolve it, and he pushed too hard, and that's what really set him off with the
                    foreign minister and with the minister of interior, who is the real power in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>My son went back in '97 to the graduation. He had been in the American school in
                    Lugano, Switzerland. He helped me pack out of Dakar and then on his way back to
                    meet me in Brussels, he'd stopped in Rabat and went to the American school
                    graduation ceremony, at which Ginsburg, of course, was involved. He said that
                    the harangue that Ginsburg made, the Minister of Interior, was sort of a patron
                    for the school, was on the platform and was so anti-Moroccan that a lot of the
                    audience just got up and walked out, including graduating seniors.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: When I complained about it to some people here in Washington, they said,
                    “Hang on there, he's out in a couple of weeks anyway, so don't worry about it.”
                    I guess that's one reason that I wouldn't vote for Gore because that's what
                    Marc's connection was. His connection was to...</p>

                <p>GOOD: Yes, and his Miss Arkansas wife. He's in, of course, with the president for
                    whom he provided safe housing after Clinton was defeated after his first term of
                    governor in Arkansas. But he rubbed the international community the wrong way,
                    particularly the wives. They didn't like his presumptuousness with they felt
                    that he was sort of like the supreme court, chief justice, or the chief
                    ambassador in that city, and that's not the way it goes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes. By the end of the second year, we had the office back in shape. The
                    fun of the job, the creativeness was pretty well finished because our budgets
                    weren't going well. We had to begin cutting, and that's always an unpleasant
                    prospect to go through.</p>

                </p>

                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>GOOD: Yes, they shut us down. We were not one of the embassies that decided that
                    we were worth anything, so we shut down. It was all right for me, personally. I
                    got out on the golf course every morning with my boots on. It was, of course,
                    December, and there was dew on the grass, and they would bring the hose, one guy
                    on each side of the fairway, and they'd walk down to knock the water off the
                    grass. But even with the water knocked off, it was still wet. But it was warm
                    enough so that you'd start a sweater; you'd take it off by the third hole.
                    Unfortunately, back in Washington, the area director felt he was essential and
                    came to the office and thought deep thoughts and made arbitrary decisions
                    without consultation. One of those decisions was that he wanted me to do his
                    Middle East job that he had been unable to fill for a year or so. Since I'd done
                    such a good job in the past, and since he didn't think that Morocco needed an
                    exec, he didn't consult with the PAO who was there, he didn't consult with the
                    PAO who was coming, both of whom knew more about Morocco than he did, although
                    he had served there back in the '60s. He arbitrarily said he was taking the
                    position away, and that I would take the job in the Middle East, didn't consult
                    with personnel either. Of course, that wasn't something that he had control
                    over. It didn't work for him. The PMAO job was in the management branch, not the
                    area branch. But he did have the right to take the position away. Well they
                    fought it, it didn't work, so at the end of February I climbed on the plane and
                    came back for language training. He thought I was going to come back and take
                    the job. But I made my contacts, pulled my strings, and said no, and personnel
                    said, “We need you more for this other job.” The IG (Inspector General's Office)
                    had done an inspection of Senegal, our post there, and found it wanting. It had
                    a series of three PAOs who couldn't manage themselves out of a paper bag. So
                    they said, “You've got to get an exec down there who's experienced to clean it
                    up. It won't be a full tour, but we need him down there. So they put me into
                    language training for three months, and that allowed my wife and son to stay in
                    Morocco long enough to finish the school year. I, of course, had made it
                    impossible for them to get rid of the house earlier than that time either. I
                    read the lease (chuckle), and they really weren't pushing for that anyway. They
                    came and met me in June, and we did our home leave and went to Senegal.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Just from August to May '96, '97, and then came back to Washington. I
                    turned out to get a good PAO, who came down about the same time I did in '96,
                    who had administrative sense, and that's really all it needed. There was some
                    cleanup to do, some lines to redraw, but we had a good staff, particularly our
                    administrative side. What had not been allowed to happen, we allowed to happen,
                    and that was to let her do her job. With her doing her job, things went
                    beautifully.</p>

                <p>GOOD: We had, unfortunately, a difficult administrative officer, who was eased
                    out at the same time I left. I was eased out to. I'll get to that later. But he
                    had some kind of a medical problem that caused him problems, caused us problems.
                    He ended in Paris at RAMSI. I figure that was probably just desserts, if you
                    know RAMSI.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: RAMSI is the regional finance operation for Africa, Europe, and the Middle
                    East. The employees are very tough French employees. They don't take direction
                    gladly. I'm sure that they have given him no end of a rough time, because they
                    were home, and he was a visitor, and they knew he'd be leaving. And you know how
                    FSN employees can help lash the bastard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: I really could have left after six months without any difficulty. I told
                    the area director that I thought that my job should be abolished and go back to
                    the way it had been before with the regional visitor on occasion as PMO. He
                    agreed. It turned out that I left a few weeks early because the ambassador got
                    himself into a sexual harassment situation, which if you interested in, I'll
                    tell you, but which ended up with the administrative officer having to leave and
                    his wife, who was causing the problem, having to leave.</p>
                <p>Q: How did this come about? I think this is an era of “all sudden sexual
                    harassment came up,” and historically, it'd be interesting to see what was
                    considered that sort of thing at that time.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, my problem, my mistake was in not filing a suit within a 45-day
                    period. I was rusty; I was in transit; I was overseas; and as you know, some
                    ambassadors still act like proconsul. Dane was an experienced officer; he'd been
                    ambassador in Conakry before he came to Dakar. He'd started out as Peace Corps
                    in Eritrea. He and wife had been in Peace Corps. Bright guy, his wife, who was
                    bright and wrote well, was still in the 1960s mode as an ambassador's wife.</p>
                <p>I had heard before I got the post that he had had problems with the handling of
                    his female staff in Conakry. I found out, to my dismay, that he had not learned
                    anything since. We got along fine. He made me chairman of the housing board,
                    which is probably not a winning position, but at least it was nice that he
                    allowed me to have that. We had a good crew on board.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>The administrative counselor, of course, was not happy about having a board that
                    wasn't under his thumb. We, all the board, agreed that we worked for the
                    ambassador; we didn't work for the admin officer. Of course, we would make our
                    recommendations, and if the ambassador didn't like them, well, he could change
                    them, of course. That was his prerogative. But the admin officer, took off after
                    USIS as well, and made some accusations, which weren't true, and I called him on
                    it. I said, “This is not accurate.” It had to do with personnel; it was my job;
                    and he was unhappy that I was bucking him. A lot of us from the embassy went off
                    for a weekend in the bird reserve up at the Mauritanian border. The ambassador
                    came up. I was touring with the deputy admin officer; we were buddies. My wife
                    had had to be evacuated within the first month of our tour in Senegal with the
                    precancerous skin condition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They wouldn't let her come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it's right on the Equator.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Well, it is, and it started in Morocco, after I left for French language
                    training. We thought that we had reversed it in the States, and it had calmed
                    down, but when she got down there, it flared up again, and the regional medical
                    officer said, “Get out.”</p>
                <p>Of course, that was one of the reasons also I had told the area officer that I
                    wanted out as well. My job was done; the PAO was handling it well; the staff was
                    good; and so let me go. I would have rather have stayed through the ICASS
                    installation later in that fiscal year. I would rather have left in October
                    after the new fiscal year started, but never mind. When I came back from this
                    weekend, I saw that the administration officer had not corrected his actions on
                    USIS. I saw that he had left on a medical. Now he had, just before this, spent a
                    half hour of an all staff country team meeting, going through major minutia, or
                    minor minutia, however you want to look at this. Everyone was looking at him,
                    “What's going on with this guy?” The ambassador didn't say anything, just let it
                    run out. As I was leaving the room that day one of the officers turned to me and
                    said, “The guy's sick; something's wrong with him.”</p>
                <p>When we got back from the weekend we found he'd been medically evacuated. I wrote
                    him a personal note, put it in an envelope, addressed to him saying that I hoped
                    that he'd come back improved because this is, how did I phrase it? I alluded to
                    the fact that “I hope that your breakdown is cured by the time you go back,
                    because your wife deserves better than this,” something to that effect. She was
                    having a hard time; it was obvious. I was unwise to have put that line in of
                    course. His secretary didn't like him either. She opened the envelope hoping
                    that there would be something there that she could get involved with, and showed
                    it to his wife. She took it to the ambassador, saying that I was harassing
                    her.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>Well, the ambassador of course, should have done what any reasonable manager
                    would have done, saying, “Excuse me, that's not harassment. Get out of my face.
                    Stop that.” She was working in the consulate, so he had control over her as an
                    employee. But he didn't, because he did not know how to handle women. We had had
                    this problem with him twice with the housing board. He'd overruled the board's
                    decision because of State women who didn't like the decision. He wouldn't do it
                    for the men, but he would do it regularly for the women. He had problems in this
                    with his wife as well. We found the presidential visit, excuse me, the Hillary
                    visit advance team was shocked to see how she was demanding things of the visit,
                    and the ambassador wasn't stepping in, although the advance team didn't want
                    these things to go on.</p>
                <p>So what it amounted to was that he allowed the administrator officer's wife to
                    continue to harass him. Now my feeling is in retrospect, that her husband was
                    aiding and abetting, using her as the front for his efforts to get back at me
                    personally and USIS in general. What I didn't know was that the question of
                    medical records had arisen and that the ambassador told the security officer to
                    check in Washington, and to check with the post to see whether I had gotten into
                    the office to see what was going on. When I found from the ambassador that he
                    was concerned that I had seen the medical records, I said, “Mr. Ambassador,
                    aren't you aware that the fact of his departure was registered on the circulated
                    travel list on Tuesday of that week? We all knew why he had gone, those of us at
                    least in the administration or heads of sections knew everybody who had traveled
                    and why they traveled.” I said, “It was no secret.”</p>
                <p>The ultimate result was that when, we agreed, he and I, that it was finished,
                    that I had done what he wanted, although I hadn't done it quite the way he
                    wanted. He had told me that he wanted me to apologize to her. I said, “For
                    what?” “Well,” he said, “I don't know, but apologize to her so she's off my
                    back.” So I said, “Okay.” But because I'd gotten burned with a written
                    communication internal at the post, I wrote a postcard note and sent it. I had
                    mailed it at the post, and it had gone to the States and come back. I'd sent it
                    APO. He thought that I had done this purposely to annoy him. He said he had
                    expected an instant apology although he had told me, “Now don't talk to her. I
                    don't want you talking to her.” So I couldn't apologize in whatever fashion to
                    her directly. I had to do it in writing, so I did it in mail, rather than
                    internally. I got a call from the DCM back in the States, I was home on spring
                    vacation. He said, “What's going on?” I told him what had happened. “Well,” he
                    said, “you're in trouble with the ambassador.” “Well,” I said, “I'm sorry, but I
                    did what I did.” When I came back and talked to the ambassador about it, he
                    still didn't like it, I'm not even sure he believed me. But I said, “Look at the
                    postmark on the letter. The postmark was dated shortly after we talked. Just
                    because it took a long time to get to her is not the issue.”</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>So we agreed to drop it. He said, “Well, you've done what you can do, I hope over
                    with.” But the next day I got called in by the RSO (Regional Security Officer)
                    and briefed or interviewed on the medical problem. I considered that to be a
                    violation of the agreement that the ambassador had made that this was finished.
                    So I wrote him a note and said that I didn't thing think this was kosher, and
                    that I thought that, as a Christian, he should apologize for breaking the
                    agreement. His conclusion from that was that I had shown disrespect for the
                    ambassador's position. He told the PAO, not me, to get me out of town before he
                    returned in a month.</p>
                <p>There was no recourse at that point. I talked to the DCM about it, and he said,
                    “You know, what can I do? I agree with you. The ambassador however can't handle
                    this. His wife feels that he has got to show some power. He's got to get himself
                    back in charge and this is what she's demanding of him.” This is my reading of
                    what I was told. He said, “If we at our age, Paul, can't stand on principle,
                    when are we going to be able to stand on it?” But he rode through it. He's now
                    ambassador in Gabon. I came back to the States, which really was better for me,
                    because I was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: My wife, I'd been gone from her for eight months at that point. While it
                    probably would have been better for my son to finish high school off in Lugano,
                    we couldn't afford it. It turned out we might as well have done that, because we
                    sent him to Georgetown Prep, and that was just as expensive. But at least he was
                    here. We could see him regularly, even though he was in boarding school for the
                    first seven months of that year. It helped him with networking of course. It's a
                    group of people there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Okay. I had talked with the deputy director of the EEO (EquaEmployment

                    she had been set up, I'm afraid. She was shaking. She canceled the rest of her
                    trip after Senegal because she just wasn't in a condition to continue. They had
                    sent her to Liberia via Freetown, by helicopter from Freetown. (laughing)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's already the war!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Yes. Very poorly...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I mean, we had Marines holding in the compound and it
                        wajust terrible!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: She'd had a bad experience with a theft in Cote d'Ivoire athe airport. So
                    she was a nervous wreck by the time she got to Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The first thing she said to me was, “Get me back tWashington! Cancel the
                    rest to the trip!”</p>
                <p>So, okay. But we had talked there about jobs in Washington, and she said, “Why
                    don't you come to work for us, because we have a Foreign Service slot we haven't
                    been able to fill?”</p>
                <p>So I said, “Okay.” When I was back on spring vacation I went to see my career
                    counselor, who was an old friend from South Africa, and expressed my interest.He
                    said, “Okay, when you come back, we'll set it up.”</p>
                <p>I came back, I went to see him, I signed up for the job, and he said, “We haven't
                    pushed it through the committee, but,” he said, “it's 99 percent sure, so rather
                    than sit downstairs in the lounge why don't you go up and sit up in the EEO
                    office until we get this administratively finished, and then you'll be on board,
                    okay?”</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>So I did, and the chief of personnel went through the ceiling, hiboss, accusing
                    me of attempting to manipulate the system.</p>
                <p>I said, “Excuse me, Jan. I did nothing like that. I applied for thjob.”</p>
                <p>Well, what happened, what I stepped into without knowing and I guess without
                    Gary, the personal career counselor knowing, was a bad feeling between the head
                    of the EEO and the head of personnel, which went back several years. Duffey, the
                    director of the agency, had recruited this excellent EEO officer to come in and
                    take the job. One of her conditions was that the office director report to the
                    director of the agency as the legislation called for. Now it's true in the
                    government that more agencies do not work according to the law than that do.
                    State Department I think is one that doesn't do it right. They do it like USIA
                    had been doing. The EEO works under the personnel director. Well, that's a
                    conflict of interest, as you can understand.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, sure.</p>
                <p>GOOD: Duffey agreed. He said, “Okay, we'll take you, and you report directly to
                    me. You won't be reporting to the general consul's office, and you won't be
                    reporting to the personnel director.”</p>
                <p>At the time it happened, the personnel director whom I had known in the Voice,
                    she'd been personnel officer over there when I was there in the '80s and a nice
                    lady, we'd gotten along fine, had had her dander raised by this, felt her
                    position had been threatened. She had an interest in disturbing Hattie Baldwin
                    in the EEO office as often as she could. Although Hattie could easily get in to
                    see the director, by this time, Duffey was already tuned out. He hadn't been
                    very tuned in much in the beginning. She couldn't find him as often as she'd
                    like to find him; you don't use up those contacts unless it's a serious problem
                    anyway. He had promised her two FSO personnel positions. The personnel people
                    had dragged their feet and had not instituted two positions on paper actually.
                    When Hattie had recruited the people, the fellow in personnel comes down and
                    said, “No, it isn't there,” accused me of trying to subvert the system, and
                    canceled it. Gary got in trouble for having pushed me up there.</p>
                <p>So I walked across the street to the Voice. I saw him at lunchtime,out walking
                    one day. He said, “What 'cha doin'?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'm not doing anything at the moment.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, come work for me; I need you.”</p>
                <p>He had hired Janice in the first place back at the Voice, so he coulcall in some
                    chips from her. He called her up and said, “I want Paul.”</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>She said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>It's exactly the same kind of subversion in the system, if you wish (laughing),
                    that she was accusing me of having done around the EEO, but never mind. In this
                    case she was on the right side, and everything went fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Instead of going to the EEO office, where I'd already been introduced by
                    Hattie as the new Foreign Service representative, I went over to the Business
                    Development Office, which is the fund raising office for the Voice. I did
                    thereafter do the training for EEO counseling and worked for the next two years
                    as a counselor doing the preliminary work on investigating the complaints as
                    they came in and turned them over then to the office to be dealt with as they
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>Evelyn Lieberman was the new director at the Voice when I got there. Again, I
                    wasn't in a line position to defend. The Development Office, a small office, had
                    a directorship equal to the director of the Voice of America. They had gone
                    through a very strange reorganization in 1991, which had made everyone equal,
                    even though when I was there before, these individual offices, like personnel or
                    administration, were under the VOA (Voice of America) director's control. Now
                    they were all raised up to be equal with the Voice of America director, and it
                    wasn't working well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: But there were more problems than that. Earl Klitenic, who was my new boss,
                    the senior SES (Senior Executive Service) person at the Voice, who'd been the
                    fellow who dealt with my problem with Barbara Hutchinson back when I left the
                    Dominican Republic back in 1975, and who recently has been hit by some sexual
                    harassment suits of his own, was not getting along very well with the women who
                    were taking over the Voice of America. Evelyn was in charge of the Voice, her
                    chief of staff in coming with her was a woman; the chief of staff for the BBG
                    was a woman, excellent lawyer who'd been working with EEO in her previous
                    career; and the new head of the programming, the top civil servant in the Voice
                    was also a woman who had had problems with Carl in the past.</p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>But underneath it all, was Evelyn's feeling that this was a policy problem. It
                    had nothing to do with gender or anything else. That the way that public
                    broadcasting, NPR (National Public Radio) and so forth was now handling
                    fundraising, that they were compromising their independence by soliciting funds
                    from companies, organizations, and people to provide extra funds for extra kinds
                    of programming, or in the case of the NPR to subsidize the entire operation
                    along with other monies that were coming from the government and monies that
                    were coming from other contributors, too much plugging of the contributor's
                    institution in the promotion, and she felt that that was bad. So she was
                    resisting, despite the fact that the reason the office had been set up was that
                    the budget cuts in the Voice had reduced the available funding for the large
                    infrastructure staff that was available to do things. They had the resources of
                    people, equipment and time, but they didn't have the money to work with.
                    Business Development was set up to bring in money to utilize the resources that
                    the Voice and others might have, let's say Radio Free Europe, and so forth, to
                    the furtherance of the goals that we all had with the Voice of America.</p>
                <p>Well, the people in the regions and the language areas were very happy to get
                    money. They could get money for travel. One of the projects that was funded was
                    working with conflict resolution in central Africa, funding teams of media,
                    people to go over there and develop programs that could be broadcast on the
                    Voice to explain how conflict resolution could be implemented, interviewing
                    people who were doing it successfully, interviewing academics back here who were
                    involved with the theory, all this kind of good stuff which is educational and
                    supports the policy efforts that we have through the State Department and
                    others, e.g. AID, in central Africa. That money came from AID. AID was happy to
                    get extra resources that would support their programming. They gave us several
                    million dollars over a period of years to do that through the Business
                    Development Office.</p>
                <p>We got Radio Marti money from Carnegie's, international institute of peace. We
                    got some money from some businessmen to help support what they had as an annual
                    project of radio dramas. One of the guys we had one year, who was the detective
                    from Law and Order, came in; he was one of the voices on the show. They enjoyed
                    doing it, gave the Voice an interesting, different kind of programming to put
                    up, didn't cost the government anything, the money to pay these people came in
                    from the other sources, so it was very frustrating to find that there was no
                    real support from the front office. Of course, every project had to be approved
                    by the front office.</p>
                <p>So we didn't have free reign to go out to the foundations. Of course, the
                    foundations, at the same time, had some reservations also about contributing
                    money to a government operation. “Why would the government need money?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>GOOD: There was a lack of communication between the two. Foundations, as you may
                    be aware, and certainly I wasn't at the time, are hard to get to. You have to
                    have some way of getting through the firewall that protects them from being
                    inundated with requests for aid. They've got money; people want money; they've
                    got to have some way to filter; and unless you can get around that firewall as a
                    government entity, they're not interested in talking to you once they can
                    identify you as a government office. It takes time to build up those avenues of
                    access that a member of the general public would not normally have. Now you can
                    get some of those networks set up because some of the people in charge of
                    foundations have come from the State Department or from other elements of the
                    foreign affairs community and you know them or know a friend who knows them, and
                    you can get access that way. But with resistance from those in foundations who
                    were not too keen about working with the government, what's the organization
                    down in Arlington, in Rosslyn that runs the Newseum?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Newseum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The Freedom Foundation, the Freedom Foundation. (The FreedoForum)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Freedom Foundation. (The Freedom Forum)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They absolutely refused. They were happy to talk with me, but they said,
                    “No, we have a policy that we will not go near you with the government or
                    anything because it compromises us.” And then we had the government with Evelyn
                    Lieberman, resisting, accepting the money when it would come, because they were
                    afraid of being compromised. It was a difficult position for Earl. I stayed for
                    a year. The staff was fine. Course it was nice being back at the Voice. I really
                    had more fun dealing with the EEO problems. They had more than 50 percent of the
                    complaints for the agency in VOA building itself, for reasons that I think I've
                    expressed before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>GOOD: So I shifted over then to the Interagency Working Group; Jake Gillespie was
                    in charge of that.He had asked personnel to keep an ear open for anyone who
                    might be looking for something to change to. I talked with him, and he was happy
                    to offer me the position, which was opening in, I think it was two weeks. I
                    shifted over, and that was a very interesting period of time. I stayed with that
                    office through two annual publications, about a year and a half total. I got in
                    in the middle of the first publication, that annual report. The Interagency
                    Working Group for Educational and Cultural Exchange had been set up by the White
                    House in anticipation of what they knew was going to be coming from Congress as
                    a mandated legal entity, to examine the U.S. government's funding of exchange
                    programs across the board, all U.S. government, executive, and some IR
                    (International Relations) quasi executive operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Including military, AID, State Department, USIA, HUD, HHS, you name it,
                    everybody. We had I think some 31 government agencies involved in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Obviously Defense and AID and Justice and USIA are of the largest of them,
                    but there are lots of international programs that I didn't know about. Post
                    Office is involved.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>The way the office was set up was that we had accounts, if you will. We were
                    account executives. Each of us had a corral full of agencies that we dealt with.
                    We were contacting them, getting information, making sure that we had
                    exhaustively identified all of their contributions, writing them up, editing
                    them, getting them to publication, and distribution. Defense was one of mine;
                    HUD was one of mine; I had a number of others. There were three others in the
                    office who also were dealing with the rest of the agencies. Jake was in charge.
                    The head of the E Bureau was technically the head of this organization, but five
                    organizations, Defense, Education, Justice, State, and USIA, equals, ran it. You
                    had a group around the core, which had major interests in exchanges and were
                    interested in the organization, which met on a regular basis, quarterly, or more
                    often, depending on what level you were dealing with. If you were dealing with
                    the major representatives or whether you were working with the working level,
                    what we call the sherpas, as we all were sherpas. We dealt mostly with the
                    sherpas. Jake dealt with the representatives. It was interesting for me because
                    it was the first time I had really investigated the source of funding for many
                    of the exchange programs. I learned how complicated having the State Department
                    as the lead for our foreign affairs operations has become. Of course, we know
                    State is faltering on this for all kinds of reasons that we could talk about for
                    hours, but Congress still funnels most of the money for these international
                    exchange programs through State, $50,000,000 plus filtered through to Defense
                    through State. That works very well because Defense worked very well. They're
                    well organized; they have a marvelous civilian staff in charge of it, and very
                    gung-ho and energetic people doing the programming. It's more problematic with
                    USIA and much worse with Justice. The performance measurement requirement that
                    you may know, set up by Congress some years ago, doesn't work well with this
                    process of filtering through State. The person charged with measuring the
                    performance is the entity that gets the money from Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: The person who is actually doing the programming is not that organization.
                    What you get is the traditional evaluation of your program, “Was it logistically
                    well run?” not whether “Did it achieve the ends that were set up for it to
                    achieve?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They aren't taxed by Congress for doing the measurement. If it's Justice
                    that's doing the programming, it's State money. State is supposed to do a
                    performance measurement, but State isn't staffed to do that. They're lucky to be
                    able to keep track of where the money's going. The money zeros out. You shift
                    the money over, the program finishes, the budget disappears, you'd close the
                    books on it, so it doesn't exist on paper any longer, so you can't evaluate it
                    if you wait that long, so it doesn't get evaluated. Very interesting.</p>

                <p>That kind of info data gathering that we were doing was only part of our job.
                    Bean counting is one thing, Congress wanted morThey'd like to know more than
                    where the money is going, how much there was and we came up with a million and a
                    half dollars. We were supposed to be investigating, special problems sort of the
                    way the GAO (General Accounting Office) does it, but focused specifically on the
                    question of our exchange programming. Each of us was assigned a couple of topics
                    on that, a couple of chapters in the annual report. That was interesting; that
                    took a lot of research and a lot of interviewing of people who were
                    knowledgeably dealing with that kind of a topic, like in one of my cases,
                    performance measurement under the government act. We did get, and knowing what
                    we had been doing and so forth, I know how much it's worth, the vice president's
                    reorganization hammer. We got awarded that my second year there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was for cutting down on-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Reorganizing government to be more efficient and that sort of thing. Well,
                    they were desperate for a candidate is why we got it, I'm sure. But we did get
                    the hammer. I think it was a $2.67 hammer, and we got our certificates. For me
                    it was most interesting to have a reason for burrowing into the workings of
                    other agencies than State, USIA, and AID, with which I of course was familiar
                    from overseas. To see how other people looked at us, which was not very well I'm
                    afraid, was very exhilarating. State was the least favored member of any group I
                    worked with, because they said, “If you get State involved, nothing happens.”
                    They either aren't interested, and we certainly felt that with the State
                    representatives. They were not interested in providing information; they
                    resisted; they stalemated our requests; they weren't available, with some
                    exceptions; INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research) was fine. But except for
                    INR, it was almost impossible to get your information. So when we were dealing
                    with other organizations, they would request that State not be represented. DS
                    (Diplomatic Security), I should mention as another exception on this, although I
                    had a number of problems with DS more recently. I led a team to South Africa, as
                    I said, last year. That was another part of our evaluation efforts to see first
                    hand in the field how these operations worked, and how they meshed in the
                    country team level. I took representatives from Education, and Justice, and AID,
                    and State with me, the core groups. Fortunately our representative from State
                    was in DS, and so we worked quite well. But it was interesting to see how we
                    were accepted by the embassy itself. AID was not happy to see us at the field
                    level. The ambassador was interested. The DAO was okay. At the working level,
                    because the USIS office was working well with AID, we could get the information
                    we needed, but they were skeptical to begin with and never really warmed up. We
                    were only there for a week; we couldn't stay forever. We couldn't do as much
                    fieldwork as we had wanted, but we did what we could, and of course, on my side
                    it was interesting to get back to a post that I had served in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>GOOD: I haven't gone back to very many posts that I've served. I did go back to
                    Colombia, obviously, because my wife was from there. We did stop in Bangkok on
                    the way back from Nigeria one time, and I passed through the airport a few
                    times. But this was only the first place that I had gone back to where I was
                    coming back on the job, rather than just as a tourist. I found that the biggest
                    problem I faced was that they remembered me, and I couldn't remember their
                    names.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Nor could I always remember where they had worked! I'd have to follow them
                    down the hall to find out where their office was so I (laughing) could find out
                    and be reminded what it was they were doing. Of course some of them had changed
                    jobs. But it was nice; they were very welcoming; they obviously had good
                    memories of my time there; and I liked that. Of course I felt bad to get back to
                    the new embassy, which we were about to move into when I left. They had had,
                    this was 1999, seven years of use of that new furniture that I'd seen in what
                    was going to be my new office, and to see how the office worked, see how the
                    security was, and the worst of all, of course, to see how the security outside
                    in the country had gone down, down, down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GOOD: My wife went back later at the end of '99. She said, “It's getting worse,”
                    as reports from friends had it, but a beautiful country; just one beautiful
                    place to be stationed.</p>
                <p>The Interagency Working Group really had been run by USIA. All of us there were
                    USIA employees, and we didn't like that because it wasn't the way it'd been set
                    up to be. As I said, the White House had set it up to begin with. A year later,
                    after I had arrived, Congress got around to passing the law, the president
                    signed it, and we were on board as a Congressionally mandated operation. Instead
                    of to the White House directly, we now sent our report to the Congress directly,
                    a copy to the White House. We wanted representatives from other agencies to come
                    in and help, rather than having it all done by us. So they were able to get a
                    representative from Defense to come over. I stayed almost until his arrival, and
                    then I shifted over to State to finish out until retirement, because I say, I
                    wanted to stay with the organization through the transition, so I could see how
                    it really had come about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>

                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>GOOD: I went over to work in the International Organization's Office as one of
                    the international press representatives for the six months until I retired.
                    There were two of us for international and two for domestic, press office, if
                    you will, press officers. Of course, I checked with and continued to check with
                    those of my friends who are still there, as well as my State friends who watched
                    us come, particularly the GS (General Schedule) employees. It's depressing to
                    see how things have not improved, and, on our side, gone way downhill. The E
                    Bureau, Cultural and Exchange Bureau of the State Department now, had some
                    residual memories there when it was CU (Bureau of International Cultural
                    Affairs) before the separation back in '78 when they moved it over to USIA. It
                    will continue I think because there's a role awareness that State has understood
                    for years. On the information side though, there's less understanding because
                    USIA officers, by their program prerogatives, were action oriented and results
                    oriented. State, by its nature, is passive is too strong a word, although it's
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: They're not looking to meet a deadline on a policy decision. They don't
                    have to do something tomorrow. While the press attach� in the embassy overseas
                    will still be valued by the ambassador in most cases, I'm sure, it's
                    questionable whether the programming that we had been doing overseas will get
                    that same kind of understanding. I foresee the budget being cut, and now that
                    the 18 months will soon be over, I guess it was six months, yes, a guaranteed
                    six months, that's over now, positions are going to be moved away from those
                    dedicated slots into desk jobs, assistant desk officers and so on. The pool of
                    people available to do the press attach� work here in Washington, aren't going
                    to be there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GOOD: Cultural programming overseas, libraries will probably suffer, and speaker
                    programs will go down, manpower won't be protected and it goes back to
                    philosophical difference between the organizations. Of course, if Holbrook gets
                    in, perhaps it will help change.</p>
