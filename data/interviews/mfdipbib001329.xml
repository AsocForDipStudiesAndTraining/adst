                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 28th of January 2003. This is an interview
                        with David G. Brown. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Do you go by
                        Dave, David or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I prefer Dave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Let's start at the beginning. Could you tell me
                        when and where you were born and a little about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1940. My father's family is from
                    Cincinnati, Ohio and my mother is from Providence, Rhode Island. My father
                    worked for Proctor &amp; Gamble, in sales, and we spent most of my first ten
                    years moving around New England and New Jersey. Then he got an offer to go as
                    Director of Sales for Proctor &amp; Gamble in the Philippines. Living in Manila
                    was what started my interest in international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, let me go back first. What was your father's
                        background as far as schooling and where the family came from and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio and went to college in the east, at
                    Princeton. After graduation, he went to work for Proctor &amp; Gamble, which
                    happened to be the company that his father had worked for.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Proctor &amp; Gamble is really a major institution. People
                        I've talked to others, they retain their people sort of like it was a
                        family, not a family, but a business that people sort of settled into
                        comfortably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right. My grandfather had worked for one company through his business
                    life, and my father worked for the same company until he retired about 1970.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your mother? What was her background and where
                        was she born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: She grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, the daughter of a lawyer and his
                    second wife. There was a large gap in their ages, and my mother was brought up
                    primarily by my grandmother after my grandfather's death. She went through what
                    one might call a finishing school and attended what is now National Cathedral
                    School, before becoming a secretary. A mutual friend introduced her to my
                    father, and after a short courtship they were married. Throughout their married
                    life, she was focused on her family.After my father passed away when she was
                    about 60, she blossomed into her own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was she doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: She became interested in writing and eventually wrote a book entitled
                    Memories about her life.She took up genealogy, edited a genealogical quarterly
                    and produced a second book on her family's genealogy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall anything about sort of your early education
                        before you went to the Philippines, schools you went to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I attended public schools in the states and then international schools
                    while abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's rather difficult in a way. You were always the
                        new kid on the block since you moved around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We moved about every year and a half. Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during this time did you develop into a reader
                        or sports or what sort of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>BROWN: I certainly was not a great athlete. I was sort of a scrawny kid. Nor was
                    I a particularly good student. My most difficult year was the first year in the
                    Philippines when I was in the fourth grade. My promotion to fifth was
                    conditional on my attending summer school. Later when I failed admission to U.S.
                    prep schools, I had a catharsis that motivated me to become a more serious
                    student. That happened when I was 16, and was living in Canada after leaving the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me about the Philippines. You were there; this
                        would be 1950 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We arrived in the summer of 1950 and left in the summer of 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you recall about the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not a great deal. I do remember reading about the Korean War. The mental
                    picture I have of myself is of a kid lying on the floor with newspapers and
                    circling words that I didn't know in the newspaper stories about the Korean War
                    and going to the dictionary and looking them up. We lived in a compound with
                    walls around it, and I went to the Manila American School. Honestly speaking, my
                    life revolved around the school and the country club. There is not much other
                    than this memory of reading about the Korean War. Did I remember later that the
                    Chinese got into the fight at that time? No, I have no recollection of that. I
                    was not seriously interested in international affairs. I was not reading, as I
                    do now, avidly about Americans who were involved in foreign policy. That came
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, where did you go when you came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: My dad got transferred to Canada, and we moved to Toronto. I was put into
                    what you might call a British boarding school. I stayed in that school until I
                    graduated in 1959. By that time, my dad had moved on to Venezuela.It was then
                    that I failed to get into American prep schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What school was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: This was a school called Upper Canada College located in downtown
                    Toronto.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it, I mean, the education system and how
                        did you fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the trauma of becoming a boarding student in an unfamiliar
                    environment was not a very pleasant one for me. I had some difficulty as a
                    foreigner being accepted into a group of kids who had known each other for a
                    long time and were part of Toronto elite society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find the Canadian viewpoint, you know, in
                        more or less retrospect a different one than you were getting from history
                        and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The Canadian education system at that time was based upon provincial level
                    examinations. The whole focus was on doing well in those examinations. It was
                    not an educational system that encouraged you to think. It was an educational
                    system that pushed you to learn things so you could pass the examinations. It
                    wasn't until I got back into the American educational environment, I also went
                    to Princeton, that I found myself pushed to think and have a different point of
                    view. Of course, we studied Canadian history, most of which I have forgotten. I
                    would say one thing that I got from my Canadian education that was of real
                    benefit was learning to write concisely.Writing pr�cis's was a standard part of
                    English in this school system and in the exams. You would be given a paragraph
                    say with 500 words in it and be told to boil it down to 250 words without losing
                    any of the content or meaning. I think this really helped my writing skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, it would be particularly useful for a career in
                        the Foreign Service. Well, was there any doubt in your mind that you were
                        going to Princeton or was this on the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Worry, yes. I had become a more serious student and since in those days my
                    memory was pretty good, I could do the memorizing. I had studied Latin, which
                    was largely memorization.I could figure out the grammar of Spanish and French. I
                    did a lot of math and science in high school, other subjects which one could
                    concentrate on and get good grades if you worked at it. I got into Princeton and
                    immediately dropped my interest in math and science and went in a totally
                    different direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Princeton from '50?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: '59 to '64.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '59 to '64. What was the situation, was it still the
                        eating clubs situation there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. The clubs were more important then than now. I had a very unusual
                    experience there because I got married at the end of my sophomore year. So I
                    lived off campus and could not afford to join eating clubs. That really cut me
                    off from a lot of campus life that I might have participated in otherwise. I got
                    into a club, but couldn't afford to pay the bills and never really
                    participated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Princeton, what areas did you sort of concentrate
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There's an interesting story there, which I do remember. In the spring of
                    1959 when I was accepted to Princeton, I was sent forms asking me to sign up for
                    fall semester classes. At that time, I had just finished reading the book, The
                    Ugly American. That book sparked my interest in international affairs and a
                    diplomatic career. Going through the catalog, I noticed that Princeton taught
                    Chinese. So I wrote down Chinese, sent the class registration form to Princeton,
                    and then went off for the summer. That summer I was working at a camp for
                    handicapped children north of Toronto in the lake area, and I didn't give a
                    thought to Princeton for almost the whole summer. In September, I arrived at
                    Princeton and was handed the registration card on which there was, in
                    handwriting that looked remarkably like my own, the word “Chinese.” Did I really
                    want to do this, I asked myself?</p>
                <p>I then went and talked to Fritz Mote who was a professor of what Princeton called
                    Oriental Studies. He said, well, you took Spanish when you were in high school.
                    You got pretty far along with it. Here's what I recommend. Take the one class in
                    Spanish you need to meet the language requirement. But also try Chinese out for
                    the first semester. If you like it, you can continue. That's exactly what I did.
                    It wasn't so much that I loved Chinese. It was that the professors in the
                    program were really attentive to their students and cared. So, I stuck with
                    Chinese, and Fritz Mote arranged for me to get a scholarship at the end of my
                    junior year to go to Taiwan for a year abroad. I went. Not only was I married at
                    that point, but also I had a young son who was three months old. The $3,000
                    scholarship allowed us to fly to San Francisco and get on a boat and sail to
                    Taiwan, spend a year there learning Chinese on my own and doing research on the
                    thesis I had to write.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Princeton, were you, I'm always curious
                        about people who come out of this era, were you caught up in sort of the
                        Kennedy phenomenon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about that a little bit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BROWN: I was not intensely involved in politics, but I remember very much being
                    back in the United States after having spent a considerable amount of time
                    overseas and following the Kennedy-Nixon debates and seeing Kennedy give his
                    inaugural address.It was exciting and inspiring. In the context of having read
                    the Ugly American book, I was high on the idea that I would learn about other
                    countries, study the language and dig deep in to their societies and pursue a
                    career in public service in response to the call that Kennedy was making.
                    Interestingly, this was also he period when I read and was deeply impressed by
                    Douglas MacArthur's farewell address at West Point. His speech about duty, honor
                    and country.So two very different individuals were each inspiring me to public
                    service. In fact, I took the Foreign Service exam one week after Kennedy was
                    assassinated and fortunately just slipped through the cracks of getting into the
                    Foreign Service. Nonetheless, there was no doubt in my mind at that point that
                    this was what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about your, its quite unusual for someone
                        getting married when they're in college, particularly in those days. Where
                        did you meet your wife and what was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I met her in Venezuela during the holidays that I spent with my
                    family. She was the daughter of an Exxon executive working in Caracas at that
                    time. She had been born in Massachusetts and was going to Dana Hall School
                    outside Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the top ones.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right. Anyways, we pursued our courtship at some distance, but I would
                    frequently hitchhike to Boston to see her and she would occasionally come down
                    to Princeton. We decided to get married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the authorities give you any problem on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. Both of our parents were a little resistant, but were understanding
                    and let it go forward. In the end this marriage did not last.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Princeton were you getting any other courses in
                        international relations and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A little bit of economics. I took a lot of courses on East Asia. My final
                    year after I had completed all the course requirements, I took a lot of history.
                    I took a course on the American Civil War. I took a course on Russian history
                    and on British history and all of that was partly by inclination because I was
                    by that time finding that I really enjoyed history.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, on the Taiwan side, what did they do? Was there a
                        structured course or did they dump you in Taiwan and it was up to you or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That was the first year that Princeton had sent students to Taiwan.Two of
                    us went. For my colleague and I, the only requirements was that we be in Taiwan,
                    that we devote ourselves in some fashion to studying Chinese and Chinese society
                    and, when we came back, that we would make recommendations on what future
                    students should do. The latter was really very easy because the year that I was
                    there, which was 1962-3, was the year that Stanford University organized the
                    Stanford Center which was an inter-university program operated on National
                    Taiwan University campus. My colleague and I did not have a structured program.
                    We got introductions to some people who would help us.I tried to audit courses
                    at National Taiwan University but found out that my language was not adequate.
                    Therefore, I fell back on a pattern of doing tutoring with a professor and
                    pursuing my thesis research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The thesis was about a man, Hu Shih, who you've probably heard of. He was
                    a liberal intellectual in China who participated in the May 4th movement. Hu
                    also served under Chiang Kai-shek as a government official including as
                    ambassador to the United States. When the nationalists retreated to Taiwan, Hu
                    was involved in setting up an intellectual journal of contemporary affairs.One
                    of Hu's colleagues in this was a man named Lei Chen. Lei decided to go a step
                    further and organize a political party in opposition to the nationalists. When
                    he did that the government cracked down and threw him in jail on trumped up
                    charges. This had happened two years before I went to Taiwan. What I tried to do
                    was to write a thesis to understand why Hu Shih had chosen not to come to his
                    colleague's defense. So, I spent a lot of time reading Hu's writings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he died by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, Hu had passed away. I did interview some people who knew him. I was
                    really green, and I did not have anyone in Taiwan who was helping me. Censorship
                    was heavy, and the subject was one that was very difficult to discuss with
                    Chinese.I could have gotten myself thrown out of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A naive kid wandering around asking about somebody who was
                        associated with dissidents.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BROWN: So, it's probably fortunate that I spent more of my time in the library at
                    Academia Sinica. This was only possible because of connections that the
                    university had set up for me. I was able to go out to Academia Sinica, use their
                    files and read everything that was in the press at the time and research the
                    laws that were in place. It is fascinating now because Chen Shui-bian, the
                    current President of Taiwan, has just released a study about Lei Chen's arrest.
                    It sheds light on things that were hidden at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But looking at this figure, did this give you, I mean,
                        granted you're really green on this whole thing, but did it sort of open up
                        a slight window on to Chinese political life and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How things worked and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any old mentor or something you could go to
                        and say, “What's this all about?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I didn't have anyone like that when I was in Taiwan.On my return, Prof.
                    Mote was my mentor. He worked with me on that thesis. I have a recollection that
                    also maybe the other person who was helping was Marius Jansen, who was a Japan
                    specialist. He has a very keen analytical mind and he helped quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find living there? I mean, was this a society,
                        what sort of society did you find this living in Taiwan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: One strong impression was the extent to which the society was still
                    wrapped up in Chiang's goal of returning to the mainland. The visuals were
                    something that you associate now with a communist country. Billboards and
                    placards and statues extolling Chiang. Yet, I never had any sense that I was
                    being followed or harassed.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Another one of the visuals was that there still were pillboxes at main
                    intersections, creating an image that if there was ever any unrest; soldiers
                    were going to be ready to gun down the populace. In one sense it was rather
                    comical because the pillboxes were often painted with slogans. Everyday life was
                    pretty good; life seemed to be improving. This was the beginning of Taiwan's
                    economic miracle. We lived in a Japanese style house with almost no heating.
                    Bought almost everything off the local market. I survived economically because
                    my dad had worked out with the local representative of the American President
                    Line for me to exchange my dollars and get local currency, the New Taiwan
                    Dollar, at about two and a half times the official exchange rate. That's what
                    allowed me to stretch my modest fellowship and support my family for ten
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling because this was not that long after
                        the Taiwan Strait crisis and all. Was there a concern of Mainland China
                        jumping on Taiwan or Taiwan jumping on Mainland China? Was this sort of an
                        issue that was around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I will have to say that I don't recall thinking or worrying about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean it probably shows something. What about were
                        you getting, was what was happening in Mainland China at all a topic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We would talk about it occasionally amongst American friends, but it
                    wasn't something I spent time talking to people in Taiwan about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time you wanted to get involved with the
                        Foreign Service and all that. Were you meeting any people at the embassy or
                        getting any idea of what diplomats do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A very good question. Almost no contact, but two officers at the embassy
                    were interested in keeping in touch with students. They were Stape Roy and Jay
                    Taylor. They invited my colleague and me to dinner once. I have no recollection
                    of what we talked about that night, but I was terribly impressed with these
                    young men and that confirmed my interest in a Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Princeton or while you were on your own,
                        were you ever able to read any books about what diplomats do in the American
                        Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A funny thing, I just didn't do that then.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a man named Stuart I think did something called
                        the Practice of Diplomacy or something like that from Stanford. I think it
                        was the only book around. Well, back at Princeton you were going to graduate
                        in '65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I am a member of the class of '63, but because of this extra year that I
                    took to go to Taiwan. I graduated in 1964. During my senior year, my wife was
                    going to the University of Pennsylvania. We lived in Philadelphia, and I
                    commuted three days a week to Princeton. My time at the university was focused
                    on getting class work done and getting back in the car for the drive home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because people who've gone to Princeton
                        for the most part seem to be from my experience a much tighter knit
                        group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went to Williams and I just went and it was over, but
                        the Princeton alumni are I mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's true. It's in part because of the club system, and how close
                    friendships develop in those years. I missed out on that because of my marriage
                    and getting separated from the people I normally would have graduated with and
                    then in my final senior year I didn't live with classmates. It wasn't just that
                    I was off campus, I was out of town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Out of town, yes. Well, then, when did you take the
                        Foreign Service exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was in the end of November just about a week after Kennedy was
                    assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be '63, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, 1963. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22nd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I took it in New York, sometime in the spring of 1964. I was offered an
                    appointment in August 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was, now do you recall any questions that came
                        during the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well I remember one. Should we recognize “Red China?”I made what I thought
                    was a terribly persuasive case for recognizing the PRC. The examiners had two
                    comments about the exam.Sonny, you don't know very much about the United States.
                    You've got to study it more. It wasn't quite that brusque, but almost. The other
                    was that I had guts trying to get into the Foreign Service by making an argument
                    for recognizing Beijing. Yet, apparently, I'd made the case persuasively and
                    respectfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's interesting. You know, I think there is a
                        whole very solid body of opinion who calls it practically we should
                        recognized the PRC. I remember I came in the Foreign Service in '55, but I
                        always had that, it just seemed like a lot of people over there were talking
                        to the Soviets, why not these, they had some other problems, but just how to
                        deal with this government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Under Kennedy, there were people, Roger Hilsman and others, who were
                    advocating improving relations with Beijing.We would have gone farther at that
                    time if the Cultural Revolution hadn't intervened, but that's a different
                    story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heard somebody tell the story that when Eisenhower
                        talked to Kennedy just before the inauguration he said, “I'll give you
                        support on a lot of things, but don't try to recognize China” I don't know
                        if this makes sense. Kennedy was very cautious. He had won by a very small
                        margin. So, you came in really right out of college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Though I was a bit older because in the Toronto education system, they
                    have 13 years of high school and I'd done that and then I'd done the extra year
                    in Taiwan. So, I was almost 24 when I joined the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling that the oral exam may have
                        pointed out that you missed something about being an American? You know, I
                        mean American history or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, this was pointed out to me, but no, I didn't have any sense I was
                    missing something. I was really focused on trying to understand foreign
                    countries, particularly China and Taiwan.</p>

                <p>BROWN: When I came in I was tested I think at the 2/2+ and my first assignment
                    was to Taipei. The Department said I didn't need language training. I was told
                    to study on my own.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I recall learning an awful lot of things about how government works. I was
                    a tabula rasa on the practical aspects of government. We had to do a research
                    paper, and I did mine on Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then your first assignment was to Taiwan?</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: If you remember the Service in those days, there were rotational junior
                    officer positions</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: My first six months was in the economic section. I was the assistant
                    commercial officer working for a wonderful avuncular man named Ollie Bongard,
                    the Commercial Counselor. I guess my greatest accomplishment at that time was to
                    launch a Chinese language commercial newsletter working with the Chinese on the
                    stuff at the embassy. So, I was really digging into that subject matter. It was
                    a great deal of fun finding out how one prints with a Chinese typewriter,
                    interviewing people about how they liked the newsletter. It was mimeographed, a
                    very simple production. Then I did a stint, which was supposed to be six months,
                    but ended up being nine or ten, in the consular section wrestling with the
                    question of student visas.Dick Hart, the section chief, was another mentor who
                    took me under his wing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the attitude of dealing with at that
                        particular point, anybody who got a degree and came to the United States as
                        a student would probably dig in. Now, it's quite a different matter. There's
                        much more backwards and forwards.</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BROWN: We were having maybe 5% or 10% of students come back when their education
                    was finished. It was not a very satisfactory situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, first of all, who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: At the beginning, it was Adm. Wright. I recall he left soon after my
                    arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just looking in the, Wright, Gerald Wright, yes. He
                        was an admiral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: What were his years?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gerald Wright was there from '63 to '65.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Okay. I arrived in '65 and then there was a gap and I think the next man
                    was Kirk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, Walter McConaughy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Walter McConaughy. Anyway, there was a long gap. My current colleague,
                    Ralph Clough, was the DCM and charge then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the attitude, I mean, you're the junior
                        officer there and it always ends up I gather because of my experience, a
                        clique of junior officers, you know, who sit around and talk over tea or
                        beer or whatever it is. What was the attitude towards Chiang in Taiwan in
                        those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Disrespectful I would say. He wasn't in senility at this point, but he was
                    in declining health and the whole idea that he was going to lead them back to
                    the mainland was obviously a charade. The focus of people's attention then was
                    Chiang Ching-kuo. Given his mixed background, what was he likely to be? It was
                    clear that he was going to take over from his father. I'm trying to remember, in
                    1965 or '66, Ching-kuo was, I think, Vice Minister of Defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had also come out of the sort of the enforcement
                        side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely. He had a very dark image at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for being a China hand at this point?
                        Were there China hands around and were you sort of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I certainly thought I was part of a group of people who had made a
                    commitment to studying and knowing about China, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about studying on the side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I worked at it pretty hard. I guess one of the highlights of my time there
                    was joining the Junior Chamber of Commerce. I spent a lot of time with them and
                    used them as a network to get to know people around the island. The Jaycees was
                    a very well developed organization, and it was entirely in the hands of Chinese.
                    There were a few foreigners in an organization of several hundred members on the
                    island. There were three or four foreigners and one of my colleagues and I from
                    the embassy were amongst those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the colleague?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Bob Littell. The Jaycees was a tremendous eye into Taiwan society.It
                    allowed me to use my Chinese, as everything was done in Chinese. It was a
                    tremendous help to my language, but it also was a window into what was taking
                    place amongst younger upcoming people on the island. I had an opportunity to see
                    an organization that had a lot of both mainlanders and Taiwanese in it. They
                    were running for elections within this organization to get chosen for the
                    leadership positions and how did they go about doing it. How did the networks
                    that they developed work? To what extent were people reaching across the ethnic
                    lines? This was still a period when Taiwan was very much split, not in terms of
                    political organization because there weren't any opposition parties, but in
                    terms of ethnic background. There was still a great deal of hostility towards
                    the mainlanders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you, well, even back to the time when you were a
                        student there, this split, did you find that one tended to sort of get
                        absorbed into the mainland thing at first or was there, could you bridge
                        this gap?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BROWN: While a student, I did not get to know many young Chinese. My friends were
                    other Americans and my contacts were older people at Academia Sinica and Taiwan
                    University. I met some students, but not many. It shows the things I missed. I
                    should have been actively involved with students, but I wasn't. I was young and
                    much more bookish.Back in Taiwan a second time, I was older more mature and
                    operating in an environment where people were engrossed in local politics.As I
                    said, the Jaycees were a tremendous window for a young person like myself to
                    take advantage of. I was 25, 26 and these people tended to be in their late '30s
                    and '40s, but nevertheless I made a lot of friendships, some of which are still
                    alive today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find a curiosity on the part of the people
                        in Taiwan from the professional class about who you were, where you were
                        coming from and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about at the embassy was the embassy absorbed by the
                        mainlanders or was sort of the handwriting on the wall for everyone that you
                        know, eventually the Taiwanese are going to take over and we better get
                        ourselves positioned correctly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The mainlanders dominated government and many of ones contacts were with
                    the bureaucracy.There was at that time an officer in the political section whose
                    job it was to follow the opposition and that was Jay Taylor. He was one of four
                    or five people in the political section. Everybody else was focused on working
                    with either the Nationalist party or the government apparatus or the military,
                    all of which at that time were dominated by mainlanders. There was just one
                    person really in the whole embassy whose job it was to get to know the
                    opposition, and he had to operate carefully. There were prominent opposition
                    figures at that time. One that was talked about a great deal was Henry Kao, who
                    had been elected mayor of Taipei City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the KMT or the nationalist government coming down
                        heavily or were there any opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BROWN: I won't say there was nothing, but there was not a great deal of
                    opposition activity in this period. It was too dangerous. I don't know this so
                    much from my recollections from that time, as from the study I have kept up
                    since. I teach a course now on Taiwan. You had the Lei Chen case in 1960 as I
                    said and then there was the arrest of Peng Ming-min and two students who were
                    with him in late 1964. He was a professor at the National Taiwan University who
                    was arrested just before my time at the Embassy. His case played out during my
                    time.I can't remember any other serious arrests taking place during my tenure.It
                    wasn't until the '70s that you began to have a resurgence of active opposition
                    activity. What you had in my time there as I've said were some Taiwanese who
                    would run in local elections against the KMT and occasionally win.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Taiwanese moving into the coming from the chamber
                        of commerce, were they moving into the commercial side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, absolutely. You could see this. Particularly outside Taipei, it was
                    almost, the Jaycee organization was almost entirely Taiwanese outside of
                    Taipei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking sort of back on this, but at the time is there
                        such a thing as a Taiwanese, people from the island of Taiwan a way of
                        operating that may be different from the mainlanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Culturally there was little difference.I was quite impressed how strongly
                    Chinese Taiwanese society was. If you go there today, there is a resurgence of
                    interest in Taiwan culture, which hadn't really started at that time. It really
                    began in the '70s. Now Taiwanese nationalists have a very clear concept of how
                    their society is different from other Chinese societies. This is what social
                    science calls an “imagined community.” They draw on their past to suit political
                    needs, but in terms of why are Taiwan businessmen so successful on the mainland
                    in their investments, it is in part because they know how to operate in a
                    Chinese environment. They know the language, they know the culture, they know
                    how people act.</p>

                <p>BROWN: 1966. It was just starting as I left to go on to Vietnam.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, my recollection is that we talked about this a lot and that many of
                    us thought something ought to be done to open contacts with Beijing.But we were
                    just junior officers in the embassy, and in those days junior officers weren't
                    let in on issues such as these that were handled by the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, with the chamber of commerce or even as a
                        consular officer and all, did you have much dealing with the bureaucracy at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, some. After my consular time was up I was transferred to the
                    administrative section. There I got an unusual task to catalogue all the Chinese
                    employees, foreign nationals contractors, residence staffs etc. This wasn't a
                    counter intelligence issue, just a simple question of who was working for us,
                    doing what in what capacity.The study turned up a surprising number of people
                    employed officially to handle private work for senior officers.I endeared myself
                    to my colleagues asking why taxpayer money was being used to hire gardeners to
                    cut the lawns of all the officers in the political and administrative sections
                    and why is it that the administrative counselor had more of these services? I
                    was getting in trouble. So, I was moved out of that section pretty quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you finish up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I had hoped that my last rotation would be to the USIS office in southern
                    Taiwan. I had traveled around the island and visited the south several times.
                    There was a staffing gap in the USIS office in Tainan, the cultural center in
                    the southern part of Taiwan. So, I made a pitch for not going to the political
                    section, but spending my last six months as the branch public affairs officer in
                    Tainan. I was told no; you should go to the political section. I think the
                    Embassy was afraid that I was too green and too prone to do things on my own.
                    So, it was safer to have me in the political section. I did that for about two
                    months and then there was an appeal for people to go to Vietnam. I
                    volunteered.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Vietnam was becoming controversial. I thought it would be good to go where
                    the action was.Was I for the war, was I against the war, was I going down there
                    to find out what the truth was, you know.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as I look upon it my motivation for volunteering
                        there in '68 or '69 was kind of this is where the action was and I wanted to
                        see it. A sense of a little adventure and this was sort of the focus of all;
                        I wanted to take a look at it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Was there an element that it would look better to volunteer rather than
                    just being ordered to go there? There may have been something in that because
                    just everybody was going one way or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you went to Vietnam; you were there from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was a direct transfer sometime in the summer of 1966 for an 18-month
                    assignment. I extended it for a couple of months and left in August of 1968. I
                    think it was June, maybe July, because I had to get start Japanese language
                    training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in '66, what was the situation in
                        South Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The war was not going well, and the Americans were getting more and more
                    heavily involved in it, not just in a military sense, but in every aspect of
                    Vietnamese life. I got assigned to the provincial reporting unit. I came with
                    Chinese and there was a Chinese affairs officer position in the embassy, but
                    that slot was filled. As I did not know Vietnamese, I was assigned to cover the
                    II Corps highlands area where you could do more with French than elsewhere.As I
                    had studied French in Canada years earlier, the Embassy arranged brush-up
                    classes to bring my language up to the 2+ level. The II Corps highlands was
                    where the Montagnards lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that where you spent your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I lived in Saigon and traveled every week to the highlands. We traveled by
                    plane, small one or two engine planes. You would take off, fly over the jumble,
                    crossing yourself all the time that the engine would keep going until you get
                    where you're going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about. Who were the Montagnards and what was
                        the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BROWN: The Montagnards are aboriginal people. The name Montagnards was given to
                    them by the French because they lived in the highlands along the western border
                    with Laos and Cambodia.No one knew exactly how many there were, perhaps one
                    million, divided into any number of tribes. The Vietnamese traditionally
                    despised them. The French had had a policy of keeping the ethnic Vietnamese out
                    of the highlands. This was not a magnanimous policy but one designed to reserve
                    the area for coffee and tea plantations run by French planters. Since the French
                    government was gone by then, there was a Vietnamese administrative structure in
                    the towns and some Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese merchants. But the bulk of the
                    population in this highland area was Montagnards.In the war, they were caught
                    between the Republic of Vietnam with the U.S. on one side and the Viet Cong on
                    the other side.Both sides were trying to recruit Montagnards because they were
                    tough fighters who knew the terrain. The Montagnard economy and way of life were
                    of course being disrupted by the war.Their economy was slash and burn
                    agriculture.</p>
                <p>While we're on Montagnards, let met mention one highlight of my work with them.
                    In 1967 National Geographic did an article on the Montagnards. I help the
                    reporter and was surprised to find myself quoted in the lead paragraph of the
                    piece. Nothing profound, just a quote about the Montagnards being caught between
                    the government and the Viet Cong with their way of life in jeopardy.</p>
                <p>The U.S. government goal was to persuade the Vietnamese government to abandon
                    their cultural prejudices and adopt an enlightened policy that would attract the
                    Montagnards to support the South Vietnamese government. That was a large part of
                    what the embassy was trying to do in the highlands. There was a political
                    movement among the Montagnards called by the French acronym, FULRO, for the
                    United Front for the Liberation of the Oppressed Races.These were Montagnards
                    who were trying to preserve their own culture and achieve autonomy from both the
                    Viet Cong and the government. So, much of what we tried to do in that period was
                    to convince the Vietnamese to be sensible enough that you could then encourage
                    this FULRO movement to cooperate with the government against the North
                    Vietnamese. It was a lot of fun for a young guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BROWN: I would take advantage of people who had some knowledge of and contact
                    with the Montagnards. These were sometimes anthropologists, or AID officers
                    working in AID's program of assistance to the Montagnards or sometimes
                    Montagnards who were working in local administrations in the highlands. The
                    Vietnamese had a Montagnard Commissariat, something like our Indian affairs
                    bureaus. One of the anthropologists was Gerry Hickey who had the respect of
                    these people because of his real interest in understanding their lifestyle.
                    Speaking in practical terms, I would arrive by plane in a provincial town,
                    borrow a vehicle from the local USAID office or the military and drive around to
                    see local figures. I'd listen to what the military said about where it was safe
                    to go. I would talk to French planters, to local officials, local businessmen
                    and religious leaders. Occasionally, I would drive to a Montagnard village to
                    meet tribal leaders who were known to be influential in the Montagnard community
                    or have contacts with FULRO. I'd drink fermented rice wine through a long straw
                    from a communal wine jug, being careful to stay sober so I could get back when
                    the meeting was over.We then used some of these contacts to send messages to
                    FULRO which was operating secretively out in the bush.</p>
                <p>I worked with Ted Heavner who was the Deputy in the Political Section responsible
                    for our dealings with the Montagnards.I can very much remember one time when we
                    had set up a negotiation with the head of FULRO.Ted and I went by helicopter to
                    a designated clearing in the jungle where we were met by a group of
                    Montagnards.Ted went off with them into the bush for several hours while I was
                    told to wait with the helicopter. I never got to do anything quite as dramatic
                    as that myself. Now, apart from what we were doing, the U.S. Special Forces had
                    a string of bases along the Vietnamese border and they hired a lot of the
                    Montagnards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back at the embassy, in the first place you were
                        part of the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: At the beginning it was Phil Habib, then later Arch Calhoun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How did you find the political section? Were they,
                        was it a diverse group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, it was a diverse group. Were our attitudes diverse?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BROWN: I think the lower you got in the embassy the more you encountered a belief
                    that our policy wasn't working.Our mandate in the Provincial Reporting Unit, ten
                    officers at that time, came from Phil Habib, who told us to get out around the
                    country and tell the ambassador what was really happening. I think certainly my
                    perception at the time was that the U.S. government was so deeply involved that
                    there was no longer a sense of responsibility on the part of many Vietnamese for
                    what was happening to their own country. I arrived as we were building up toward
                    the peak of the American military presence there.Over time I developed a
                    conviction that the U.S had to reduce its role and return more of the effort to
                    the Vietnamese and make them responsible for their own future. I recall this
                    view was widely shared.I remember Vice President Humphrey coming through and
                    other people. Occasionally, such delegations would have an hour and a half
                    discussion with the people in the Provincial Reporting Unit.A pretty standard
                    message on our part was that more American troops wasn't what was going to win
                    the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the situation of the highlanders or the
                        Montagnards? Did you find that this was a sort of a minor thing that you
                        were reporting on or was this of concern at least from your perspective
                        within the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, yes, it was a serious concern because this was a strategically
                    important part of Vietnam. It was not that the population was large but that the
                    geography was strategically important. Therefore, getting the cooperation of the
                    Montagnards was a pretty consistent goal.It wasn't just the Vietnamese who had
                    to be persuaded to cooperate with the Montagnards. I remember at one point a new
                    American general arrived, I can't remember his name, but he was moving his
                    division into the highlands and wanted to burn down a section of the highlands
                    to deny cover to the enemy. My colleagues in AID and I geared up a major effort
                    to persuade the Embassy to persuade him not to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, as a practical matter, geographically, this
                        is where the collapse of South Vietnam started up there in '75 I
                        believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: You have a very good memory. That's exactly where it started. There was a
                    big battle around Pleiku and the South Vietnamese were defeated.And in a matter
                    of weeks, the north moved down the highways to the coast and from the coast all
                    the way down into Saigon and that was the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did you get any feel about, granted you were pretty
                        low on the feeding system, but about Elsworth Bunker, the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I certainly have a sense of respect for him. How much influence did
                    he have back in Washington? Again, my memory fails me as to what he thought.
                    When I first arrived Henry Cabot Lodge was ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cabot Lodge. Did the sort of the changes in government in
                        South Vietnam on the Vietnamese side have much effect in the highlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I cannot remember specifics, but yes, President Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky
                    were in power throughout my time in Vietnam. However, there was a mix of types
                    on the Vietnamese side in the highlands. Some officials were more enlightened
                    and realized Vietnam had to work with these people. Then there were others who
                    you might describe as Neanderthal hardliners whose view of the highlanders was
                    these are primitive people, they have no future. The future is for us Vietnamese
                    to develop the highlands and if we have any trouble with the montagnards we're
                    just going to shoot them and burn their villages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Special Forces, they'd been there, did you
                        find them a good source, I mean what was your impression of the Special
                        Forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Are they a source, did we use them as conduits? My recollection is that
                    there were some Montagnards working for Special Forces who we knew had
                    connections into the FULRO organization and could be used to send messages.
                    However, the Special Forces were not really integrated into the embassy's
                    political approach to this. What kind of respect did I have for these guys? A
                    lot. They worked in very tough circumstances and very exposed and were doing
                    their best. I wasn't a military guy. I didn't try and second guess their tactics
                    of how to interdict Viet Cong operations along the border. I did listen very
                    carefully to their advice about where to travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the regular army units? Did you find this a
                        different breed of cat or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I didn't have much to do with the GIs. My contacts tended to be with
                    the Intel people and occasionally with the senior officers. We had different
                    jobs. The intel people were focused on the Viet Cong units. My attention was on
                    what's going on amongst the populations in these areas and what were their
                    attitudes. What were their attitudes about the prospects for the war? What were
                    their attitudes about the South Vietnamese government? Despite the general I
                    mentioned before, generally, I found what I thought were very intelligent men
                    leading our military. There was a General Lee, I can't remember what position he
                    was in, but I remember him wanting to talk to me about the Cultural Revolution
                    China and what this would mean for the prosecution of the war. In fact at one
                    point, he sent word he wanted me to come and brief him. I was flattered.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then were you there for Tet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me your experiences during Tet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Okay. There are two sides of this story. The first is just anecdotal.
                    Before Tet 1968, within the Provincial Reporting Unit, we decided that one
                    person in each corps area would be out in the field and one other would be back
                    in Saigon. My II corps colleague, Jim Mack chose to spend Tet in Nhatrang, so I
                    stayed in Saigon. If he had wanted to come to Saigon and I had chosen to go to
                    someplace else, I would have gone to Ban Me Thuot. As it happened Ban Me Thuot
                    was overrun by the Viet Cong, and local AID officers with whom I probably would
                    have been staying were captured. Luck was with me.In Saigon, I and another
                    officer, I think it was Allen Wendt, drew straws as to who would do duty in the
                    embassy that night.Allen drew the duty, so I wasn't in the embassy building when
                    it was attacked. I was living in an apartment building across the street from
                    the embassy. It was a surreal experience. There were three of us, including
                    Steve Johnson, Ulysses Johnson's son; living together in this apartment. Between
                    the three of us, we had one weapon, which was my Montagnard crossbow. So, we
                    were not inclined to go out and try to win whatever was going on outside.We
                    called the embassy and the lines were dead. We couldn't get through to them or
                    to Arch Calhoun or other people. We turned on the radio, Armed Forces Radio,
                    which was running baseball games. Every now and then it got quiet, we'd poke our
                    head out to try to see what was happening. All of a sudden there would be more
                    staccato gunfire.Eventually it quieted down the next morning. What had happened
                    was that about 30 Viet Cong had shot their way into the embassy compound and
                    were in the garden area around the building having killed a couple of marines in
                    the process. Fortunately, they did not get into the embassy building. Allen and
                    the others inside survived. In the morning, a U.S. ranger battalion was brought
                    into reoccupy the American Embassy. When we eventually went to work the next
                    morning we were literally walking over dead Viet Cong bodies to get into the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>The other side of the story is how to interpret Tet. Honestly, I can't remember
                    what a report I would have written shortly after this would have said. My
                    recollection is that I was focusing on what was going on in Vietnam. I didn't
                    have a good understanding of what the impact of this event was back in the
                    United States. There was sort of a division of opinion is my recollection
                    between the people who were emphasizing what a shock this attack had represented
                    and how close it came to succeeding and that therefore this was a harbinger for
                    real trouble for the government and U.S. Then there were others, and I put
                    myself in this category I will admit, were more impressed that this massive
                    attack had been repulsed and that in large part by U.S. efforts we were able to
                    recapture all the main cities that had been lost in about six weeks.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened up in the highlands at Ban Me Thuot and
                        other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not a great deal, but in Ban Me Thuot a number of people were captured,
                    Americans because the Viet cong attacked the provincial headquarters and the AID
                    offices and they captured some Americans, including Mike Benge who was an AID
                    employee and who had been with AID in the highlands for five or six years and
                    was about as close to the Montagnard community as any AID employee. He was a
                    prisoner until '75, broken by the experience.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. You did not see this. The highlands had not been the focus of their
                    attack. I mean they were attacking Saigon and Hue and Nhatrang and all the main
                    cities. Tet was going to be a coup de grace, a knock out blow, and so the
                    highlands was not a major focus.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I will be honest, I thought a policy of gradually reducing the
                    American presence and turning things over to the Vietnamese had a good chance of
                    success. That proved to be wrong.</p>

                        training.</hi>

                <p>This is tape two, side one with David Brown. Today is the 11th of February 2003.
                    1968, what caused you to go after Japanese training?</p>
                <p>BROWN: I was a China hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In those days we didn't have relations with China. Having been in Taiwan
                    in a junior officer slot and in Vietnam, which was a very unique experience, I
                    wanted to do something in normal diplomacy. You couldn't do that in Hong Kong.
                    That was where you would go if you wanted to report on Mainland China from the
                    outside. I'd been in Taipei so I decided do something different by going to
                    Japan where the U.S. had diplomatic relations and where I could be in an embassy
                    and gain experience in normal diplomatic work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this raises a question. I've thought about this.
                        We've had our China hands, but it became a very sort of a distant type of
                        diplomacy. I mean essentially they were observing another country not having
                        real diplomatic relations. I mean you had it with Taiwan, but other than
                        that it was sort of like calling themselves political officers, but
                        essentially everybody was an INR officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's exactly it. If you went to Hong Kong you were reading the press,
                    reading interview reports of refugees, trying to pick up local newspapers from
                    around China and read them and read between the lines so to speak to figure out
                    what was going on in China. It was more of an intelligence analyst's job and I
                    wanted to practice diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem you know with your China
                        background and all getting yourself into the Japanese orbit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, at that time when you'd done your service in Vietnam, the personnel
                    system was trying their best to satisfy your interests. So, when I said I wanted
                    to take Japanese language training, the request seemed to have been granted
                    quite easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you took Japanese. How did it, describe
                        Japanese language training, you started in 1968, how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, students spent a year in Washington, not in this gorgeous campus
                    that we have now, but in a building down in Rosslyn and you did a year of
                    training there and then went to Yokohama. Some people went from one year of
                    language into a consular job, but I got in the other track and was put through a
                    second year of training in Yokohama and then went into the political section in
                    Tokyo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, essentially you're taking Japanese from '68 to
                        '70?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find here in Washington, how did you take to
                        Japanese training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Fine. I was happy to do it. It's a hard language to learn. It's got a very
                    complicated grammar. It's got characters you have to learn. I had a leg up on
                    the characters having studied Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Yokohama, the idea of course is to get you away from
                        the embassy and everything. How did that work? Did you stay with a Japanese
                        family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was married and had a young son. My family lived with me. We went out on
                    the Japanese economy and rented a Japanese style house with tatami mats and a
                    tokunoma, which is a decorative alcove in a room where you put a flower vase and
                    a hanging scroll. The house was a split personality in the sense that it was
                    mostly Japanese but had a western style kitchen and dining table with chairs. We
                    didn't have to eat every meal sitting on the tatami mats, Japanese style. It had
                    a little garden in the back and it was a wonderful experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They were pleasant professional language teachers. It was a wonderful
                    year, though a bit of a strain studying language day after day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your wife pick up Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, she did not. She did not take to Japan very well and that contributed
                    in part to our divorce.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It's really very difficult. You never know how these
                        things will take.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from '70 to when did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I spent three more years in Japan from the summer of '70 to the summer of
                    '73 in Tokyo. All the time in what was called the external unit of the Political
                    Section and my principal beat was to follow Japanese policy in Asia. The biggest
                    part of that was Japan's relationship with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of course an interesting time, too. Before we get to
                        that, how would you describe Japanese American relations in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They were reasonably good. We had been through the period of
                    demonstrations against the U.S. Japan security treaty. That was in the past. We
                    were in the process of, I wasn't involved in this, but we were in the process of
                    negotiating what we called the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese sovereignty and
                    of course when that was accomplished in 1972 that was a hugely symbolic event
                    representing America's respect for Japan and the fact that we were, you know,
                    returning the territory to them. Relations were reasonably good. One bad aspect,
                    that again I was not personally involved in, was the controversy over textile
                    exports from Japan to the United States. Later, there were more serious problems
                    caused by the so-called Nixon shocks. The first of those being over Kissinger's
                    secret trip to China and the second one being the U.S. decision to go off the
                    gold standard. Both of these steps were taken without prior consultation with a
                    country that was deeply affected by the decision and a close ally to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it you know, somebody trying to deal with the Japanese
                        government. Was there kind of a I don't want to sound fictitious, a Japanese
                        person you could talk to or if you wanted to deal with the Japanese
                        government you found yourself sharing with a whole bunch of people. In other
                        words you couldn't go up to the prime minister and say, look we're going to
                        be recognizing China, but don't tell anyone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, first dealing with the Japanese government was quite favorable.
                    Although I was a junior officer, my counterparts were officials with
                    considerable influence on policy. The Foreign Ministry did control Japanese
                    foreign policy. Within the Foreign Ministry, responsibility was delegated
                    downward on most issues rather remarkably. An office director was tasked to come
                    up with policy ideas and to lead a process of consultation within the Japanese
                    government.His boss, the assistant secretary level person was then responsible
                    for selling these policy ideas to the upper levels of the bureaucracy. The
                    ministry's leadership worked hand in glove with the governing Liberal Democratic
                    Party and would get the LDP's blessing, which was normally pro forma. The LDP
                    controlled the Diet, so there wasn't any problem at that level. If we were able
                    to work things out with the ministry at the level at which I was dealing, things
                    went very smoothly. Now, needless to say when you run into a crisis in the
                    relationship as we did when Kissinger's secret trip was revealed things got
                    escalated way up the line and it was the ambassador who was dealing directly
                    with the minister and political leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador when you arrived in 1970?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Armin Meyer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A Foreign Service professional, but a Middle East hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've often seen it as an odd fit there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, and I would say not a particularly successful one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you know, you were a junior officer, but within
                        the embassy, what was the consensus or was there a feeling why Armin Meyer
                        ended up in Japan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He was completely loyal to President Nixon. I think that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's probably. I mean it was a major embassy and
                        Nixon remembered people who had been good to him when he was in the
                        wilderness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't quite know what that connection was, but it was very clear to all
                    of us in the political section that Meyer was loyal to the president and that
                    whatever the president's policies were he was going to very faithfully follow
                    them out. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The way it affected us was that he did not want anything reported to
                    Washington that was critical of the president's policy. So, there was a lot of
                    tension over what was reported and what wasn't reported. It often ended up with
                    the political counselor saying sorry guys; this is what we're going to
                    report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's sort of dangerous, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean no matter how, the president will live if people
                        don't agree with him. I mean loyalty is not always a virtue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, one has to carry out orders, but the other side is that you must
                    report accurately or Washington want have a reliable basis for making policy. Of
                    course, we got around the reporting obstacles. Not that I was being particularly
                    devious, but the political section as a whole got around it by passing messages
                    through visitors, in telephone calls and private letters that were used to
                    ensure that the people on the Japan desk knew our views. The desk was reading
                    the summaries of the Japanese press and criticism of policy could not be hidden.
                    However, if we tried to report that the president's policies were creating
                    problems in our relations with Japan, that kind of commentary was not something
                    that the embassy sent in officially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you dealt with external relations. Before we move to
                        the China one, what about, to me one of the great puzzlements remains with
                        the Soviets and now the Russians, the hanging on to those little islands up
                        to the north or not making some concession seem and the fact that we were
                        just at the time of the reversion of Okinawa. I mean the contrast couldn't
                        have been greater and where it seemed like the Soviets were in a continual
                        case of shooting themselves in the foot with Japanese relations. It was
                        extremely important for the Soviets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, one would have thought so. The Northern Territories were a thorn in
                    the side of the Japanese-Soviet relationship. In recent years, they have tried
                    to deal with it off and on in a more compromising way, but even now nationalist
                    sentiments block progress. But nothing was really happening on that issue in the
                    '70s when I was there. It had been discussed in the mid-'50s trying to deal with
                    this and trying to work out a compromise that involved two of the islands coming
                    to the Japanese and the status of the other two being unresolved. However, that
                    didn't work out then and issue was frozen the whole time I was there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Quite frankly, I can't remember any big issues there. We didn't really
                    have much in terms of serious problems with the Japanese in terms of policy in
                    Vietnam. We were in the process of trying to wind things down and the Japanese
                    had no problem with that. That was not a big issue.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was in August of 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So, what was the state that we were observing of
                        Japanese Chinese relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Our policies were quite consistent with each other in the sense that
                    neither of us had relations with Beijing and both governments were in the
                    process of thinking about how to change that and modifying their policies in
                    modest ways. Both governments were in sync in terms of supporting the Republic
                    of China in the UN.The big difference was that the Japanese had a substantial
                    economic relationship with China and the U.S. did not. We still had an embargo
                    on trade with China, though U.S. had already been going through a process of
                    small steps with China to signal that we were open to improving relations. Then
                    the big break came when China invited the U.S. ping pong team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the famous ping pong diplomacy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right. I didn't get involved in it personally because my boss here was
                    also a China hand, Bill Cunningham and he jumped on that as soon as he heard
                    that the news of the invitation. The ping pong team actually transited through
                    Tokyo on the way to China.Bill helped facilitate that and went out to the
                    airport and saw them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Japanese economic relationship with
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was not an aid relationship, but a purely commercial one, and it was
                    done under the rubric of a trade agreement between a Japanese trading
                    association rather than the government and the China Council for the Promotion
                    of International Trade, a government front group handling Beijing's trade with
                    the West. It was a pretty substantial relationship.For Japan, which was
                    promoting itself as a trading nation, being able to sell everywhere was
                    important.The U.S. didn't really have a problem with this Japanese trade because
                    we too were moving away from a strict embargo on trade with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any disquiet in this period by say the Japanese
                        hands of watching Japan, it was about this time Japan was really turning
                        into an economic powerhouse, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. This was their period of fast growth and also a period in which the
                    economists in Japan were making predictions to show when the Japanese per capita
                    income was going to surpass the United States, when the Japanese economy was
                    going to end up being bigger than the American economy. So, yes, the Japanese
                    were on a roll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern on our part, I mean, you know,
                        people looking out from the embassy that you were hearing about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: When I was there, no, subsequently we can talk when I got on the Japan
                    desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Textiles of course were, Nixon owed a lot of his election
                        to factory states in the South, part of the southern strategy. Textiles in
                        those days were a big deal there in the Carolinas and that sort of thing. I
                        guess that, did that intrude on what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It didn't intrude on what I was doing, but it was being handled by other
                    people in the embassy and I was knowledgeable about what was going on and about
                    the extent to which it was creating friction in the relationship. Nixon had met
                    Tanaka who was I think at that time the Minister of International Trade Industry
                    and that they had had a discussion on limiting textile exports. Tanaka had said
                    something that for Japanese meant that they would study it, but not do
                    anything.Nixon interpreted he remark to mean that Tanaka had agreed to solve the
                    problem for the United States. That was a misunderstanding that created real
                    strains in the relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in a way being a China hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, we followed Japanese ties with China closely. I was not an
                    intelligence officer but I read all open source information about China in Japan
                    and reported it.I was supposed to maintain contact with the Japanese China
                    watchers who met Chinese coming through Japan. There were academics whose
                    knowledge and opinions about China we reported. But the main work was
                    maintaining very close coordination with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. We
                    exchanged information on what they were doing on what our policy was, the steps
                    we were taking. There were annual consultations between the Office of Asian
                    Communist Affairs, the China desk at the State Department and the Ministry and
                    between their policy planning staff and our policy planning staff.We were in bed
                    with each other. That's what made the absence of prior consultation about
                    Kissinger's visit to China in 1971 such a shock.</p>
                <p>The Japanese government was under a certain amount of pressure to build upon the
                    economic relationship and to begin to improve relations with China. Some
                    European countries were moving ahead to recognize China in the early 1970s. Out
                    of deference to the U.S., the Japanese government was resisting the domestic
                    pressures on it in order to stay in sync with the U.S.The State Department too
                    was trying to keep our two countries on the same wave length. Then suddenly
                    without a word of forewarning the U.S. takes a huge step to open up its
                    relationship with Beijing. The government and the foreign ministry in particular
                    felt that their confidence and support for the U.S. had been betrayed. There was
                    a lot of bitterness in certain parts of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: how did you personally at this time, how did you hear
                        about the news and what instructions were you giving and how did you deal
                        with the damn thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, you read about it in the news. I can't remember whether we saw
                    Nixon's announcement on TV or not. We saw it replayed.Now, as it turned out this
                    had been very closely held and even Secretary of State Rogers hadn't been told
                    that Kissinger was making this trip to China.We in the embassy were taken by
                    surprise, but when we learned the extent to which other people were equally in
                    the dark, we didn't feel quite so bad ourselves.However, we still had to deal
                    with the Japanese. I can remember going over there and having an extremely
                    prickly conversation with Hiroshi Hashimoto who was then the head of the Office
                    of Chinese Affairs. He was an older man and had spent a good part of his post
                    war life involved in China. As a young man had been a soldier in the Japanese
                    army at the very end of the Second World War if my recollection is right, he was
                    in the air force. His reaction was very nationalistic. Over drinks he said this
                    was the end of Japan's trusting the U.S. The relationship with the United States
                    was going to change and Japan would have to start making its own policy thinking
                    about its national interest. That was not the typical reaction. The typical
                    reaction was not nearly so nationalistic and pained as he was. Yet it had been
                    his job to make sure that his government knew exactly what the United States was
                    doing on the China policy and he felt he had been betrayed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There is no response. There isn't a good response, but we said that we've
                    got to move on from this. The next order of business between us was the annual
                    fight over Chinese representation in the United Nations. This was something on
                    which the Japanese and American governments had collaborated to an extraordinary
                    degree on a daily basis exchanging intelligence about what was going on every
                    capital in the world, about the demarches that were being made, divvying up
                    responsibility on who could do a better job in persuading various capitals to
                    support our common cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know the Americans had sort of assumed the Japanese had
                        expended tremendous what you might call political capital in these fights
                        over who was going to represent China in the United Nations because this
                        was, every little capital, like you say, Togo or something like that and all
                        of a sudden I can't remember what we did, what did we do, fudge it or
                        something for the next time around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, there was a general presumption that this traumatic change in U.S.
                    dealings with China was going to radically undermine the efforts to sustain
                    Taiwan's place in the U.N. Nevertheless, the instructions that came out were to
                    fight the good fight. The U.S. went to Taiwan and said the only way that there's
                    going to be a hope of winning would be to go for dual representation, that is an
                    approach which would create the possibility for both Taipei and Beijing to have
                    a seat, even if Beijing. Washington tried to persuade Taipei that if we could
                    sell this it was certain that the Chinese would reject it and that Taipei in the
                    end would remain in the U.N.However, Chiamg Kai-shek but was very deeply
                    committed to the idea that the Republic of China was the sole legal government
                    of all China and he was not going to give on that. So, what resulted was that
                    Taipei said it opposed dual recognition but would not object to the U.S,
                    pursuing the idea at the U.N.So on that understanding, the Japanese and American
                    governments again together tried to sell this. However, after Nixon's
                    announcement, many governments were rethinking their China policies because of
                    what the United States had done. In the end we lost the vote in the United
                    Nations and the Republic of China walked out. Our representative to the UN at
                    the time was George Bush and he got up and he said that it is a reasonable thing
                    for China to be in the United Nations, but it's unfair the way this came about
                    because the principal of universality is important. A founding member has now
                    been thrown out which sets a horrible precedent. I'm sure Kissinger probably
                    didn't care at all that that had happened.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, before Nixon's announcement, I often talked with Japanese colleagues
                    informally about how both our counties should be moving together to open
                    relations with China. After Kissinger trip had been announced and knowing that
                    Nixon himself was going to China in the following year, a process of political
                    change was unleashed in Japan and within a year and a half Tokyo had worked out
                    its deals and recognized China and devised a formula for maintaining an
                    unofficial relationship with Taiwan which has worked for the Japanese pretty
                    well and which in fact the United States more or less copied when we took the
                    step in 1978.</p>

                        China? In the first place, what was happening in China internally '71 or

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: China was coming out of the Cultural Revolution period, the worst of it
                    was over, central control had been reestablished throughout the country and
                    things were beginning to look up. That was part of the backdrop in which the
                    Chinese representation fight was taking place. It wasn't a China that was
                    obviously in chaos and psychologically at war with the world that we were
                    dealing with at the UN. It was a China that was beginning to come out of those
                    policies and get back into more normal relations with the rest of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Japanese in the press and all, did the Japanese
                        press play much of a role in determining policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>BROWN: First of all you had a variety of opinion in the Japanese press, from the
                    liberal leaning socialists to the conservative Liberal Democrats (LDP) on the
                    right. You had some who were strongly committed to maintaining the substance of
                    the relationship with Taiwan and others including Tanaka who favored moving
                    ahead and normalizing relations with China.You had a group within in the LDP
                    that had traditionally had close contacts with people in China and were
                    promoting normalization and you had people in the LDP who were very close to
                    Taipei. So, there was a debate going on. When the U.S. made its move it
                    significantly shifted its debate so that it was quite clear that Tanaka was
                    going to normalize relations with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any understanding on the part of your contacts
                        particularly at the foreign ministry and all about understanding why in a
                        way that you were going to have this shock because this was a shock in the
                        United States, too and it was mainly because had you announced this or done
                        something you would have allowed the right wing in the United States to get
                        cranked. You know, it's a political reality in every country that you've got
                        when you have to do things, sometimes you have to do things suddenly and
                        make them a sort of fait accomplice otherwise you allow the forces that are
                        opposed to it to build up enough pressure so that you can't do the thing. It
                        sounds like Japan had the same forces I guess every country's got these
                        forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think that was part of Nixon's calculation that, if he was going to make
                    this kind of radical change, he needed to do it dramatically in order to
                    outmaneuver the conservatives who would try and block such a policy change. You
                    didn't have the same process in Japan. Japan's decision making is different.They
                    engage seemingly endless debates to build a consensus. So, it was very clear a
                    year before they recognized that this was where it was going to end. You could
                    see these debates going on in the press, Japanese politicians positioning
                    themselves in the media and partly through contacts with the foreign ministry.
                    It was just a question of what the terms would be and the nature of the deal
                    that would be made concerning their relations with Taiwan. Tanaka had to come up
                    with a deal that was satisfactory to the wing of the Liberal Democratic Party,
                    which had close ties with Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think after the shokku that we would, we
                        just had to keep our mouths shut as far as the debate was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean even if we had a policy, it wouldn't have made any
                        progress; it would just make it worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We did not try and tell them how to suck eggs on normalization.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there's a time to just keep your mouth shut and let
                        that take care of it. Did you see any effect as far of the very strong
                        nationalist Chinese supporters in the United States? You know, it used to be
                        the China lobby or whatever you want to call it, you know, the, like it used
                        to be so strong in the right wing of the United States trying to affect
                        Japanese dealing with Taiwan for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, I didn't see any of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess by that time that element in American political
                        life wasn't very strong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I think Nixon had judged correctly that he could sell the opening to
                    China to conservatives as an effective anti-Soviet maneuver. In fact, he was
                    correct. The country did come around without much anguish to support the steps
                    he took at the time. When you get to 1978 with Carter normalizing, that's a
                    different period than in 1971-72.I should go back to how we eventually got over
                    the shock with the Japanese. I would say we got over it because many Japanese,
                    despite their initial reactions, came to appreciate that Kissinger and Nixon
                    were right that the only way to make such a change was through a dramatic move
                    and understood that their initiative was moving in what the Japanese considered
                    the right direction. Therefore they came to live with it and see it as something
                    that wasn't contrary to Japanese interests even though it had been done in a way
                    that was very abrasive and regrettable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things put out was that you couldn't share
                        things with the Japanese because it got distributed I mean it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, that was part of Nixon's thinking, and there was some accuracy. If
                    you shared information with the Japanese confidentially about a U.S. initiative,
                    there was a very strong impulse amongst Japanese politicians to leak it. This
                    was because they wanted to show their publics that they had an intimate
                    relationship with the United States, and the way to do this was to leak the news
                    to the media and show that they knew before hand that something was going to
                    happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This of course is not unknown in other places, including
                        Capitol Hill. I've interviewed Marshall Green who was the Assistant
                        Secretary for the Far East and he described how he'd made some sort of thing
                        saying where Kissinger supposedly had an upset stomach or something like
                        that. He said, oh, hell, he's probably out talking to the Chinese or
                        something like that. As soon as he started thinking about he made everybody
                        sit and swear not to even mention that remark because that's exactly what
                        could happen.</hi>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way you think it has to probably have to be done that
                        way. Always there was a predilection on the part of Kissinger and of Nixon
                        to do it their own way and to get credit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find sort of let's say before because that
                        would have been when things were normal, before the opening to China,
                        dealing with the foreign ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was a very good relationship; personally we got a lot of information.
                    We shared a lot of information. It was a close relationship and it still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Japanese have good information on China? I would
                        imagine they would.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They had all sorts of sources because of the economic relationship and
                    people traveling back and forth and conversations that would take place with
                    Chinese leaders when one or another delegation went to Beijing. Did anyone have
                    real access to the countryside and what was going on in China? No, but we were
                    all trying to share the information that we had. They did their intelligence
                    reports and gave copies to us. We got material from INR, not so much from the
                    CIA because the station had its own relationship with the Cabinet Research
                    Office. So, many analytical reports were being sent back and forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you all have a feel for the tragedy of the Cultural
                        Revolution at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't know. You certainly were aware of how it had disrupted China, but
                    you didn't really understand then its full impact, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know, one of the things I'm struck about people
                        who got involved in that first opening to China. I was just talking
                        yesterday with Winston Lord. I did a very long interview with him and the
                        sort of the thrill of seeing Mao Zedong and all that, but I mean in a way
                        it's almost although, nobody was really making note that this guy at least
                        in my estimation was a real monster. The things he did to his country are
                        just beyond belief. Was this at all coming out at this particular time you
                        were dealing with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We had the impression of him as a megalomaniac who was very far long in
                    his years and was just losing it a little bit.</p>

                        voice of rationality or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That was certainly the impression we had. I can't recall any particular
                    episodes from the period when I was there, 1970 to 1973, that involved Zhou in a
                    big way. My memory's not as good as I'd like it to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the feeling that by the Japanese that China was a
                        danger as far as an expansive country or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. That was their view at that time. There wasn't a feeling of hostility.
                    In general, Japanese saw China as a neighboring country with which they ought to
                    have a normal relationship. It was out of deference to the United States that
                    Japan did not normalize sooner. In that period, China was not in the era of
                    reform and growth. There was not a sense that China was what we'd call today a
                    rising power that might be a threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about looking at China I mean you had the French and
                        British embassies and the Yugoslav embassy all of which had relations with

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We didn't get it in Tokyo, but I'm sure the U.S. government was getting it
                    elsewhere.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. We met with other embassies and talked about things from time to time
                    and I particularly would spend a lot of time talking to people in the British
                    Embassy and the Australian Embassy who were following developments in the
                    evolution of Japan's China policy the same way I was to try to trade notes and
                    exchange analysis.I didn't have much to do with the Taiwan Embassy, though my
                    recollection on this is not clear.</p>

                        feelings. I mean were there developments or were the Japanese in a way
                        turned loose as far as China was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. They felt they freed to do what was in their best interests. They
                    would keep us informed. My recollection is that I had to work harder to find
                    things out and double check sources. It wasn't quite as open as it had been in
                    the past. It was more a job of piecing information together to understand what
                    was going on in the political process in Tokyo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: My memory is failing me. I can't remember whether there was a big rush of
                    Japanese reporters to go into China at the time. I can't remember which papers
                    had those kinds of relationships whether that was changing or not. My
                    recollection is that the Chinese were quite skillful at cultivating favorites
                    amongst the Japanese press and freezing out those whose opinions they didn't
                    like.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, but I can't recall doing a great deal on Korean affairs. The most
                    dramatic thing that happened in that period happened a couple of months after I
                    left. That was the kidnapping of Kim Dae-Jung when he was in Japan. That was in
                    the fall of 1973.</p>

                    happening, but Japan was slowly moving towards what was a very important
                    decision which was to ratify the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.Another major
                    issue that I had to follow was attitudes within Japan on nuclear weapons
                    issues.What was the Japanese government doing in terms of eventually ratifying
                    the NPT?What were political and public views on ratification?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have felt that it would have been an absolute
                        surety that they were going to say hell, we don't like nuclear weapons for
                        obvious reasons and whatever you want to do to stop it, we'll sign it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, in the end, that is what they did, but the issue was debated at
                    length. There were elements on the conservative side of the spectrum that
                    complicated the process. Consultation had to take place; everyone had to be
                    brought onboard.Japan had to watch what other countries were doing and who was
                    ratifying. They didn't want to be way out ahead of the pack. They didn't want to
                    be way behind the pack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's interesting, you know, observing close hand
                        Japanese diplomacy. One doesn't see the Japanese hand in a lot of those
                        things. I mean when you think about you know, as we have today, you think
                        about France for example, its fingerprints were all over everything, but
                        what about Japan? Was there a style of diplomacy that you saw?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: At that point in time, Japan had not begun to think about having an
                    independent diplomacy. They were still very much in the mode of being with the
                    U.S. I think the shock on China was one of the things that began to prod them in
                    the direction of saying well, you know, the war has been over for almost 30
                    years now. It's time for Japan to start having its own policies. The amazing
                    thing is that we're now into the 21st Century and this sort of debate about
                    whether Japan is going to have an independent policy from the United States
                    still goes on. It's advanced and things have affected it over time, but it's
                    been a very slow process in coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the LDP had any particular cast as far as
                        foreign affairs as opposed to I guess it would be the left wing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. There was the Japanese Socialist Party, which was still opposed to
                    the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. They were in favor of moving rapidly ahead to
                    recognize China, dumping Taiwan. They wanted to normalize relations with North
                    Korea rapidly. That was part of the political scene, but the JSP was always a
                    minority, and the real action was what was going on in the bureaucracy and
                    within the LDP. Where's opinion within the LDP shifted at any given time?That's
                    what you had to take into account.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, say in the foreign ministry was the foreign ministry
                        responsive to the mood of the LDP or did the foreign ministry kind of do its
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The Foreign Ministry had a very strong sense, the ethic of the Japanese
                    bureaucracy, that they were the guardians of the national interest. The ministry
                    knew what was happening internationally. It understood the sophistication and
                    the complexities of international relations.Therefore, it was their job to make
                    sure that Japan stays on the right course. That meant that the Foreign Ministry
                    had to guide the LDP to do what's right for Japan. As I said, they didn't have
                    to worry about the other parties because the LDP commanded a majority in the
                    Diet. It was just a matter of infiltrating sensible ideas into the LDP. That was
                    done a lot at these evening entertainment parties that went on endlessly and at
                    various levels.The office directors, who were the people I was dealing with,
                    would go off in the evening for dinners and drinking with junior LDP politicians
                    and people in the business community who had interests in China policy. Policy
                    was worked out behind the scene. If a Japanese bureaucrat was doing his job well
                    he was able to come up with the ideas, to percolate them up through his own
                    system. Then the system at the senior levels would do this quiet liaison with
                    people in the LDP and the LDP itself was a very hierarchical and structured
                    organization. It was a bottom up type of decision-making. It wasn't the LDP
                    driving policy; it was the mid levels of the bureaucracy driving it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you're saying an interesting thing that much of the
                        Japanese bureaucratic system was giving power below at least, things could
                        ferment up to the top. I mean it wasn't these were at the lower level, these
                        weren't just faceless people putting stamps on things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely not. From the office director on up, they were trying to
                    structure and manage policy internationally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the, was there a good corps of America
                        hands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, yes, very much so, and there still is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they know it? I mean were they where they coming
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, it was a career service. If you happened to be the cream of the
                    crop, you got to go to the country that was most important to Japan, which was
                    the United States. You would go as a junior officer and then you return to
                    American Affairs two or three times during your career, working in Washington
                    and in the Bureau of American Affairs in Tokyo. Very typically people in this
                    track would end up as ambassadors to the U.S. and as vice ministers at home.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the America hands would be the equivalent of what we
                        used to call the Russian hands. I mean this used to be where we were
                        putting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Putting the best where it's most important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, yes. How did you find, I'm probably getting my
                        initials wrong. MITI or whatever it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: MITI, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MITI. Yes. I've always heard that was a very powerful
                        thing, but at this particular time of '70 to '73, how did MITI fit into the
                        foreign relations side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I wasn't the principal officer dealing with MITI then. It was the people
                    on the economic side that had those relationships. The way I saw it was in the
                    sense that MITI was very much involved in promoting Japanese exports and that
                    meant in addition to selling to the U.S. and Europe, selling to China and
                    Southeast Asia.They were very much involved in the economic aspects of relations
                    with China. They were pushing to open things up so that Japan could export more.
                    But that was not what was driving Japanese policy. The Foreign ministry was more
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really didn't have the feeling that well, that the
                        foreign ministry was subservient at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not at all. I mean the one agency that the foreign ministry had to be
                    particularly careful of was the Ministry of Finance because it controlled the
                    budget and resources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was administrative, but of course that's sort of
                        the guts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, yes, if you're running an aid program, which Japan was not doing at
                    that time in China but was doing everywhere in Southeast Asia, then what the
                    Ministry of Finance thought the aid levels ought to be and how they fit into the
                    budget and all that was high policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it at that time do you think were the Japanese
                        were, I mean much of their you might say their diplomacy, their outreach
                        anyway, was aid. Aid missions doing things in a way. Was this an effective
                        tool of the foreign ministry or was this sort of more benevolent I mean just
                        doing good?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, it wasn't just doing good for others because this was in the period
                    when tying aid was a huge issue.The Japanese aid was tied tightly to promoting
                    Japanese exports and that was an issue for the United States because of
                    competition for sales in developing countries. There was an officer in the
                    economic section who followed these issues and Japanese aid policy. The Japanese
                    aid may have become more benevolent over time, but it certainly wasn't then. It
                    was very clearly focused on promoting their economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you with the opening to China; were you conflicted
                        about being a China hand, Japanese hand and all? I mean all of a sudden this
                        is a new ball game.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I thought it was a great advantage to know something about Japan. I was
                    able to go back and work in Chinese affairs, but I wasn't a person who was only
                    a China hand as some others were. I would say the quintessential archetype of
                    the China hand was Dick Williams who was my last CG in Hong Kong. He had had
                    five overseas assignments during his 30 plus years in the Foreign Service. Four
                    of them to Hong Kong and one to Guangzhou. Those are the only places that he had
                    served overseas. I mean he worked on other things back in Washington, but that
                    wasn't the career track I was on. I was very happy being able to go from China
                    to something else and then back to China and then do something else and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then when you in 1973 after this real immersion
                        because there's nothing like being in a place where you really have a
                        challenge which I would imagine that you'd felt that you'd been through the
                        fire as far as having to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I'd thought that I had learned the trade so to speak.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did you do in 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I came back to INR to work on China. I wanted a job on China and I
                    couldn't get one on the desk so I accepted one working in INR analyzing
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing that from '73 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BROWN: I did it for just less than a year because I found out that I really
                    didn't like being an analyst, writing and rewriting papers and carrying
                    classified papers to the desk. That wasn't terribly satisfying.So as soon as I
                    could work it out I got out of that business and got on to the Japan desk. That
                    was thanks to the help of Bill Sherman who had been my Political Counselor in
                    Tokyo and who was then the Director of Japanese Affairs. He managed to make it
                    possible for me to go work as an economic officer on the Japan desk for two
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be basically '74 to '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes 1974 to 1976.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quickly on INR, what piece of the action did you
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Some of China's foreign policy. I remember one thing I did was a study on
                    China's ability to project military power into the South China Sea and the
                    capabilities of other military forces of countries involved in the South China
                    Sea. What would be Vietnam's capabilities, what were the Philippines'
                    capabilities?What else I was doing, I really can't remember. I do remember that
                    I didn't take to it very well, which is funny right now that I'm in academia and
                    enjoy history and analysis. At the time, writing papers, which were then
                    rewritten by three other levels before they saw the light of day, didn't appeal
                    to me. I just wanted to get back into the action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's really very frustrating. I know I had a short
                        stint in INR and I took a different path where I was a consular officer. I
                        made decisions. I liked running consular sections and you know, getting
                        patted on the head and told yes, your paper is alright, but let me really
                        change it and all that. Some people take to this. You're showing in one way
                        this is why being a China hand at the time when you started was of that
                        nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then '74 to '76 all of a sudden you're dubbed an
                        economic officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That was a misnomer because I did very little economic work. Most of what
                    I did on the desk was arranging visits by prime ministers, foreign ministers and
                    the first visit to the United States by a Japanese Emperor, Hirohito.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BROWN: Hirohito came for a two week visit in October 1975. We started a year in
                    advance to plan this visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been a lot of trepidation, wasn't it, because
                        this man was the leader of the country who attacked us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The historiography at that time, however, painted a picture of a man who
                    had been a prisoner of the bureaucracy that had created him, who was by training
                    a marine biologist and a pacifist, whose most important decision during the war
                    was the decision to end the war. That was the general historiography at the
                    time. It was 1975 and that was 30 years after the war. He was then an old man
                    who no longer had any role in Japanese politics other than a purely ceremonial
                    one. The judgment was that there would be some flak, some demonstrations, but
                    that we could pull the visit off successfully as a positive sign that 30 years
                    later the U.S. and Japan had moved beyond the war. I think it came off that
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what in planning of this... There must have been,
                        unlike almost any other State visit, you had to really think about history.
                        You know, one had to be extremely aware of what every step meant, didn't
                        one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: You got lots of help from the Japanese. We tried to structure a visit
                    around the right kind of ceremony in Washington. Ceremony is of course symbolic
                    and very important to Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the president at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Ford. We would focus on events that would symbolize positive aspects. For
                    instance, we took the Emperor to the Woodshole Oceanographic Institute and
                    allowed him to spend a half day looking through microscopes at things that live
                    between grains of sand on the beach. He was a marine biologist and interested in
                    such research. We took him to an Illinois farm that produced soybeans for export
                    to Japan.We took him to Disneyland because that was a major attraction for
                    Japanese tourists. We took him to San Francisco, to Hawaii and tried to portray
                    him as something of a human being in a way that would contribute to good
                    U.S.-Japan relations. There were some demonstrations against him. There was some
                    intelligence that we had to deal with. Some people might try to disrupt the
                    visit. As it turned out, there was very little of that and the visit went off in
                    a reasonably positive way. It generated immense coverage in Japan.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Japanese press in general is really something, isn't
                        it? Even then? How did you find dealing with the Japanese court? I'm told
                        that next to the court of St. James, this one takes and maybe the Austro
                        Hungarian court, this one is really an acronyms, a very difficult
                        court.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: As I said, it took a year to plan, and the Japanese were all the time
                    explaining to us the way the court operated and how things would have to be
                    handled. It was sort of the reverse the demands we make when an American
                    president travels overseas. Well, they were coming and telling us politely this
                    is the way things are going to be done. This is who will sit in the car with the
                    emperor and this is where the emperor will go and this is the way it's going to
                    be handled. We were intent upon having a visit that would play well in Japan and
                    also be positive in the U.S., but we realized with the media attention was going
                    to be infinitely greater in Japan than in the U.S. So, we on the Japan desk were
                    between the Japanese Embassy and the American hosts at each location. I recall
                    we arranged two detailed advance visits to each stop.The Japanese team and an
                    American team going out and talking events through with everybody involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that one of your big problems would be
                        protocol, you know, the wife of the mayor of Houston or something like
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The biggest problem that we had was the governor of Illinois whose name I
                    can't remember and the mayor of Chicago. Which one was going to ride with the
                    Emperor into Chicago?</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Was it going to be the governor or the mayor? I recall the mayor won.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you get right down to it, when you're looking
                        at national politics, the mayor of Chicago has almost everybody knows who
                        the mayor of Chicago is. I mean very few know who the governor of Illinois
                        is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you run across anything like that? I interviewed
                        somebody who had to deal with a visit of the queen of Thailand and she did
                        not like people mentioning the movie The King and I and of course every
                        hostess said, oh, I just loved The King and I, you know and dealing with
                        that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BROWN: Actually, I don't recall anything like that. Most Americans that we were
                    dealing with whether it was protocol people in Chicago, or the people at the
                    Woodshole, or the folks at Disneyland, were remarkably understanding and
                    accommodating. For example, at Disneyland stop, the management had to radically
                    alter the way the park operated for a day to make sure that all of the security
                    and protocol concerns about the Emperor were taken care of. In the end the
                    emperor shook hands with Mickey Mouse, which would have been unthinkable before
                    the war. I can't remember whether the imperial household agency was really
                    enthusiastic about that, but the Foreign Ministry wanted to humanize the Emperor
                    to a degree in the way he was portrayed back in Japan and show him as a human
                    being. So, shaking hands with Mickey Mouse was part of that and climbing up onto
                    a huge combine at a farm and being photographed talking to the farmer about how
                    this machine worked to cut down the soybean plants was part of what the Foreign
                    Ministry wanted to do in terms of the media coverage of the Emperor back
                    home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Emperor come out in your impression as a human
                        being? Did you get any feel for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, I did not because in fact I had very little contact with the Emperor.
                    When the visit took place, Japanese protocol required that senior officials take
                    the lead. Their Prime Minister accompanied the Emperor to Washington. And on our
                    side, senior people had to be involved. The Secretary of Agriculture and the
                    Governor of Illinois accompanied him to the farm in Illinois and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was feedback and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The only time I actually had some contact with him was at the hotel in San
                    Francisco at about 11:00 one night.I was in our control room on the floor. Down
                    the hall came this old man in his pajamas asking to find somebody from the
                    Japanese side. I just happened to be there. There was no one from the Japanese
                    side around. I can't even remember how I said this in Japanese, but I said
                    something like, “Your majesty, can I help? What do you need? I will find
                    someone.” He said “please” and turned around. I didn't engage him in
                    conversation, but found someone from the Japanese control room. There was a
                    foreign ministry officer in the control room, who later told me that everyone
                    from the Imperial Household Agency had gone out to enjoy San Francisco. I did
                    meet him in receiving lines, but when I did go along to events, I was back in
                    car 27, you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the visit of President Ford to

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BROWN: I wrote the papers for it, drafted the toasts, was invited to the state
                    dinner, but did sit in with the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I keep thinking of that picture showing Ford as this, in a

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That has slipped out of memory. I don't know where you saw that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you suffering from schizophrenia, sort of personnel
                        wise, were you a Japanese or a Chinese hand or was there such a creature as
                        an Asian hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There really wasn't. I considered myself all along a China hand. Japan was
                    an interest I developed in addition to my interest in China.My career took me to
                    many parts of Asia, but I always thought of myself as a China hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice with the Japanese hands, you know, we talk
                        about the China hand going back and forth to a few places, well, the
                        Japanese hand has one place to go and did you find that this your exposure
                        to both the desk and in Tokyo, did this produce somebody who was almost
                        overly localized, too much localities in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There is this danger. As I said earlier, I know some China hands who
                    worked on China pretty much their whole career. There were some Japan hands who
                    spent much of their career on Japan. In Japan, you said there's only one place.
                    In fact at that time, there were more places to go as a Japan hand than as a
                    China hand.In China, you could go to Taipei or Hong Kong and that was it, but in
                    Japan you could go to Sapporo, or Osaka or Naha, Fukuoka or Nagoya in addition
                    to Tokyo. A Japan hand could study the language training, go out a consulate, go
                    back to the desk, go out to the embassy, come back to the desk, get a higher
                    job, go back to the embassy a third time as a DCM or political counselor. There
                    are plenty of examples of people who had that kind of very focused Japanese
                    career and would have maybe one or two non-Japanese jobs. I was quite happy with
                    a more diversified set of experiences.</p>

                <p>BROWN: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now in '76 what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I went to the Office of the Republic of China Affairs which was the desk
                    dealing with Taiwan and I was there for a little over two years until the fall
                    of 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this also was a very interesting time, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There were, I would say, three interesting aspects of it. One concerned
                    Carter and human rights.Carter created a new U.S. human rights policy, which
                    brought some tensions between desks and the human rights bureau that was being
                    created then. Second, we had the first confrontation with Taiwan over nuclear
                    weapons development when I was there. The third was the lead up to normalization
                    with China.I actually left the desk before normalization, but I was there under
                    Dick Holbrook when my boss Harvey Feldman was very much involved in planning how
                    we would handle the relationship with Taiwan along the lines of the Japanese
                    model when we recognized the PRC. He handled that part of it pretty much on his
                    own. Normalization was being managed out of the White House by Mike Oksenberg
                    and Brezinski. Only a few officials in the Department were involved, including
                    Harvey Feldman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to the human rights. You started in '76 so that
                        you were on the Republic of China's desk during the end of the Ford
                        administration. So, when the Carter administration came onboard, was there
                        concern that they were going to upset things or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There was a tension. We were in the process of doing something that hadn't
                    really been done before which was to articulate a human rights policy with
                    respect to Taiwan. We were dealing with a country, Taiwan, where there were very
                    serious human rights issues. Taiwan was still a one party dictatorship. Chiang
                    Kai-shek had just passed away. His son Chiang Ching-kuo, who had run the
                    security services, was Premier. There was no freedom of expression on political
                    issues. So, there were serious human rights concerns. I was fortunate enough to
                    work for a great officer, Burt Levin. He was determined and I shared his view,
                    that the desk were going to stay ahead of the curve and set policy for Taiwan
                    before the human rights bureau — I think her name was Pat Derian — tried to
                    cease the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, Pat Derian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Burt's approach, and one I shared, was the desk would be active on this
                    acting in a way that made sense and would yield results, rather than being
                    driven by Pat Derian.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like this was a very forward policy because so
                        many of the desks sort of resisted the idea of well we can't do this because
                        of such and so. In other words, rather than being proactive, they sat back
                        and tried to be instructive.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We didn't take that attitude. Also, the Congress was getting interested in
                    human rights issues on Taiwan and that kept some pressure on us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape three, side one with David Brown. Well, how
                        did we see things? In the first place when you went to that desk, it must
                        have been on everybody's mind that things were changing. I mean Chiang was
                        dead. We recognized China.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Recognition came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean hadn't recognized, I mean we'd opened to China,
                        which was a whole new ball game, and Taiwan was not going to be the major
                        player anymore.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a sort of sitting around and regrouping and
                        saying okay, where do we go from here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was very clear when Holbrook came into the Department that things were
                    going to change, that the U.S. was going to move ahead and normalize relations
                    with the PRC. How that was going to be handled was an issue, but not whether it
                    was going to be done. I guess there were two aspects of it from our perspective.
                    One was how do you fit Taiwan into this? I can remember the first briefing we
                    had with Holbrook. He had been around to the various desks and I can't remember
                    whether we were the last or not, but we were definitely not at the high end of
                    his list of priorities. I can remember sitting down with Burt.</p>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>BROWN: Burt Levin. Holbrook came to talk with the desk. Of course when one had a
                    briefing with Holbrook, most of the talking was done by Holbrook. He started it
                    off by explaining how proud he was that he had never been to Taiwan. He had
                    never accepted a visit, had no contact, and wasn't being sucked in by the ROC
                    lobby. I recall that the main point we wanted to get across was that if we
                    wanted to normalize relations successfully with Beijing, we would have to take
                    care of the relationship with Taiwan in a manner that would be acceptable to the
                    Congress. Holbrook wasn't interested in that aspect of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I recall around this time I was in Seoul. I was chief of
                        the consular section there and I remember Holbrook making a visit. He came
                        across in those days as a young hotshot who was very full of himself, which
                        he probably still maintains, but he had been on the outside and was not
                        really overly accepted within the establishment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I don't know if you remember how his time at the Department started
                    or not.Art Hummel had been DAS and was moved up to be Assistant Secretary for a
                    period at the end of the Ford administration. Holbrook just sent a word around
                    that Art and all of the DAS's should be out of their offices by the 20th of
                    January. Hummel offered to brief him, but to the best of my knowledge Holbrook
                    never met Art Hummel to talk about the transition and what the issues were. He
                    knew what he was going to do. He was sure he was well informed. He knew the
                    people he was going to bring in. These were professionals. Roger Sullivan I
                    think came in as the DAS for China, but Holbrook was cleaning house, things were
                    going to be different. I have a lot of respect for Holbrook, but in his personal
                    relations with people, he can be either very charming if you are cooperating
                    with him, but if you're in the way, he just pushes you aside.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's still a figure in sort of the political
                        spectrum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He'd like to be Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How did you go about? Let's deal with the first
                        thing: human rights? It would have been an ambassador in Taiwan at that
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, I believe it was McConaughy who was a four square supporter of the
                    KMT. We were not out crusading, but Burt's view was that Taiwan was a society
                    which was in the process of gradual change and that we should be trying to nudge
                    them in the right direction. We didn't have many of the tools that we have now.
                    For example, we didn't develop AID programs then to strengthen the Legislative
                    Yuan. I don't recall that we changed the way the embassy operated. The embassy
                    as I said earlier had long had an officer responsible for dealing with the
                    opposition. We just tried to stay out ahead of the curve on the demarches to be
                    made. We were going to write them in our office and clear them rather than let
                    the human rights folks take the lead.</p>
                <p>It was just at this time that the first Congressional hearing on human rights in
                    Taiwan was held. It was Burt Levin who was asked to present the administration's
                    testimony. I'd love to go back and find the testimony to see if it sounds today
                    as good as I recall thinking it was at the time. We tried to lay out the history
                    of political change in China, where we thought things were going on Taiwan and
                    how the U.S. could work effectively in Taiwan society to bring about change.How
                    the U.S. ought to encourage change, not just criticize mistakes, without being
                    heavy handed.Not to threaten cutting off aid or reducing military assistance,
                    but by pursuing subtle diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel that Holbrook, did he spend any time on
                        Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. He did bring Harvey Feldman into the planning on what kind of
                    relationship the U.S, would maintain with Taiwan after normalization. Harvey
                    worked on a variety of alternatives for a consular relationship or for
                    establishing a liaison office. But in the end, the decision was to accept an
                    unofficial relationship along the lines of the Japanese. The Japanese
                    arrangements were very informal. No legislation passed by their Diet. In the
                    U.S. system everyone recognized that you would have to have a piece of
                    legislation to establish the future relationship and give it, what's the term
                    I'm looking for? Legal viability in the United States. That led to the
                    legislation that Carter put forward in the spring of 1979.What Harvey was
                    working, with some research help from those of us on the desk, was how do you
                    structure this. What kind of office do you have? What should it be called? How
                    do you maintain the legality of our agreements with Taiwan so that they would
                    stay in effect? How do you set up a procedure where you could have new
                    agreements and keep business going? All this was being studied by Harvey.There
                    were scholars in the United States that were doing research on these subjects
                    and presenting proposals. We collected their materials to ensure that their
                    expertise was available in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Chas Freeman there or not because I've interviewed the
                        guy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't know where Chas was at the time.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving back to the human rights side, how did Chiang
                        respond? I mean was there, how were things going human rights-wise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The most positive thing happening in this period was that Chiang Ching-kuo
                    was opening up the KMT to young educated Taiwanese. The KMT was a party
                    dominated by mainlanders.So this new policy was extraordinarily important thing;
                    it had started maybe three years earlier and was just beginning to pick up some
                    steam. So, when I said we tried to encourage things that were happening, we were
                    patting him on the back for doing this and we were trying to get credit for him
                    in the U.S. for moving in this direction. I can't remember just who was thrown
                    in jail while I was on the desk.We weren't apologizing for such things, but we
                    were trying to get people to see that there were other positive things happening
                    as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems with the Taiwanese I hear they
                        have a wonderful network in the United States, almost as powerful as the
                        Israeli network. Did that; was that something you had to consider
                        politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not at that time. The McCarthy era was over. Anti-communist attitudes were
                    still strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll pick that up another time. How about the
                        intelligence operations in the United States? Was this an irritant or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not that I recall. However, later when I was working on Taiwan affairs
                    again in the 80s, we did have problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned there were three things you had to deal
                        with. One was human rights. We've discussed that. What were the other two
                        now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The other two were the preparation for normalization.Americans on Taiwan
                    were very concerned that we were going to pull the rug out from under them, that
                    we weren't going to provide for Taiwan and that our economic interests there
                    were going to be sacrificed.We dealt with that. I traveled to Taiwan and had to
                    brief different groups about the thinking in Washington.While I wasn't cut in on
                    the details of the negotiation, I knew the general direction of policy. We had
                    to do the same thing in Washington when people would come through the State
                    Department and get briefed.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The third issue was non-proliferation. The problem there was that the Taiwan's
                    had bought from Canada a natural uranium research reactor, and the French were
                    in the process of selling Taiwan reprocessing technology with the idea that they
                    would be reprocessing fuel from their power reactors and using the reprocessed
                    material for fuel rods for the power reactors. The research reactor used natural
                    uranium fuel that was suitable for reprocessing into weapons grade plutonium.
                    That was a very serious concern because this technology could be turned to
                    nuclear weapons use. So, we expended immense effort to persuade the French and
                    the Taiwanese that they should not go through with these reprocessing plans. A
                    lot about this issue remains classified. I did a lot of the leg work on this for
                    Burt and later Harvey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds like a nuclear weapons program; what led
                        Chiang down that road?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The Chinese had detonated their first nuclear device in 1964 and were
                    developing their nuclear weapons capability.Countering that capability was
                    probably the prime motivation.Later our withdrawal from Vietnam and the
                    enunciation of the Nixon doctrine, which said states should be primarily
                    responsible for their own security, created doubts about the reliability of U.S.
                    commitments. That may also have been a factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did we deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: As I said, we worked to persuade Taiwan and the French to abandon the
                    reprocessing project.We used the fact that Taiwan was a member of the NPT, the
                    Non-proliferation Treaty, and that the safeguards that would have to be applied
                    in Taiwan on any reprocessing facility could only be covered by a safeguards
                    agreement that the United States had with Taiwan.France did not have a
                    safeguards agreement that would cover their sale to Taiwan, and this gave us
                    leverage.By this point in time, Taiwan had been expelled from the IAEA and there
                    was no way the IAEA could negotiate new agreements with Taiwan.We were
                    cooperating closely with the IAEA and one very knowledgeable officer from ACDA
                    helped the IAEA understand some inspection problems at the Canadian reactor. In
                    the end, we persuaded the French to drop the sale, and the Taiwanese to give up
                    their work on reprocessing. Taiwan was in the process of building a second or
                    third nuclear power station at this time, and nuclear energy was a significant
                    part of their electric generation. The nuclear technology and fuel came from the
                    U.S. This was part of our leverage. Although the reactor was a problem,
                    Washington did not object to its operation believing that a combination of IAEA
                    inspections and periodic U.S.-Taiwan nuclear energy consultations would assure
                    effective safeguards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the attitudes for the personnel
                        of the Taiwanese Embassy? This must have been, they must have thought they
                        weren't quite sure where they were going and all this. It must have been a
                        very difficult time for them.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, they were trying to do everything they could to maintain good
                    relations with the United States. They realized they did not have a sympathetic
                    ear in the Carter administration, so they were using their connections on the
                    Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Carter administration was sort of
                        turning a cold shoulder to Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, they were keeping Taipei at arm's length. We were in the process of
                    scaling down our military relationship with Taiwan.After our military role in
                    Vietnam ended in 1973, we began withdrawing military units from Taiwan that had
                    supported the war effort. The whole relationship had begun to change after
                    Nixon's trip. We had made a commitment to the PRC that we would move in the
                    direction of scaling back our military relations in Taiwan. Once Carter got in
                    office, one part of the effort to avoid a sharp break in relations with Taiwan
                    was to start a steady reduction of the military ties with Taiwan. Units were
                    withdrawn and military assistance was shifted to a loan or sales basis.The MAAG
                    and Taiwan Defense Command were gradually scaled back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then when you left there in '78, I mean it was
                        assumed I guess that we're going to have some sort of relationship with
                        Taiwan, but that we were going to have an official relationship with
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. I didn't know exactly where the negotiations stood. I left in August
                    and it wasn't until December that the negotiations were consummated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is probably a good place to stop, but where
                        did you go in '78?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I went to the U.S. Mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency in
                    Vienna. I spent three years there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we'll pick it up at that point. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 4th of March 2003. David, 1978, you're off to
                        Vienna, Vienna with the, what was it called?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BROWN: The U.S. Mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency. At that time
                    it was a separate office in Vienna with six or seven people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this part of the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The IAEA is related to the UN, and it is housed in a UN complex, but at
                    that time our office that was representing us to the UN agencies there was
                    separate from the IAEA mission. Subsequently they've been merged together into
                    one office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought about your going there? Did you have, was
                        somebody looking at your background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It wasn't entirely accidental. I was looking for something different to do
                    outside of Asia, possibly at an international organization job. Through my work
                    on the Taiwan desk on the nuclear issue, I had gotten to know quite a few people
                    in the non-proliferation field in the U.S. government and that I think helped my
                    credentials in applying for the IAEA job. Of course when I got to Vienna, the
                    work only occasionally was directly related tnon-proliferation. It was normal,
                    rather routine international organization work related to the quarterly board
                    meetings of the IAEA and the budget process within the agency and helping to get
                    American people into the key jobs in the IAEA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from '78 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Until '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went there, this was your first sort of
                        international organization, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: First and only.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you, sort of as the new boy on the block for
                        this sort of thing, how would you describe the atmosphere when you came in
                        both within our delegation and beyond?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I came in at about the same time that Roger Kirk, our new ambassador
                    to the IAEA came in.He was a very dynamic and thoughtful ambassador with a very
                    strong background in European, Eastern European and Soviet affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, we had met each other in Vietnam. I think he had been handling
                    external affairs in the embassy when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he was there when I was there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The most significant non-proliferation issue that came up during my time
                    at the IAEA was he Israeli attack on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find I mean was the organization, was there
                        a lot of as I would think a lot of sort of bureaucratic jockeying, I'm
                        thinking not in our delegation particularly, but in the overall one, I mean
                        more people looking out for titles, jobs, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, within the UN system, there is a great deal of that. Countries
                    naturally look after their nationals in the UN. Countries looking after their
                    particular interests. Our principal interest was to make sure that the
                    safeguards part of the agency's work was as strong as it could possibly be and
                    that we had our people in the key positions to work on safeguards. We also had a
                    strong interest in the IAEA's external affairs and budget offices.We wanted the
                    agency to spend increase funding and resources for safeguards, whereas the
                    LDCs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Less developed countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, the LDCs on the board were primarily interested in what the agency
                    could do to help them with development of various kinds of atomic energy
                    programs such as assistance with regulatory matters, medical isotopes, food
                    irradiation, technical assistance and so forth.That's what they wanted the
                    agency to spend its money on. So, there was a constant jockeying between
                    ourselves and those members on how the budget was split up and whether it was
                    going to grow or not grow, and in which areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How from our delegation and sort of the point of view in
                        '78, how was nuclear energy viewed at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BROWN: It was very controversial internationally. It just so happened that when I
                    was there, Austria, the host country, was conducting a referendum on nuclear
                    power. They had built a nuclear power station, completed it and then decided to
                    have a referendum on whether or not to operate it.The government was defeated,
                    and they had to mothball the plant without ever having operated it. Sweden was
                    going through the same process. I'm trying to think whether Three Mile Island
                    had happened or not happened at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Three Mile Island was around that time. It was of
                        course before Chernobyl, which really put the last nail in the coffin. How
                        did you find, let's say we want to get people into the enforcement side of
                        things. How did you go about doing this and how did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I mean there aren't great secrets on this. There is a lot of bargaining
                    that goes on behind the scenes in the agency and a lot depends on making sure
                    that the head of the agency is responsive to American concerns. The U.S. put
                    forward good candidates and talked to director general to get their
                    appointments. The Director General had to take into account the balance of
                    forces within the Board of Governors, to which he was responsible.The Russians
                    had their particular interests, as did the Europeans and others. When we had
                    good candidates for key jobs of interest to us, we were usually successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this particular time the United States and the Soviets
                        in this particular field were pretty much on the same wavelength weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, we were. The real trick was how to coordinate with the developing
                    countries on the board. That meant a lot of consulting, paying attention to what
                    they wanted, working with them at times to ensure that they in turn did not
                    block our key objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the nuclear powers such as France and Great
                        Britain fall on this thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They played a major role on the Board of Governors.One key issue during my
                    tenure was pressure from the LDCs for more representation on the Board, which
                    would dilute the strong position which the Western Europe and others group, of
                    which we were a part, had on the Board.We pretty successfully contained that
                    effort. On such issues, the Europeans and ourselves plus the Australians and the
                    Canadians were all pretty much lined up on the same side. It happened that the
                    Secretary to the Board the whole time I was there was a delightful Frenchman
                    with whom I worked very closely.If you wanted things to go smoothly, you had to
                    have his cooperation. He likewise knew that if you wanted things on his board to
                    go smoothly, he didn't want to misjudge where the Americans were coming
                    from.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Israel handled at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Israel was a constant target of others in the Agency.Their opposition
                    prevented Israel from ever getting on the Board of Governors.So, we ended up
                    speaking for their interests from time to time. That proved to be very awkward,
                    when Israel conducted the preemptive air strike that destroyed Iraq's Osirak
                    reactor in 1981. France had sold the reactor to Iraq. Iraq was a party to the
                    Non-proliferation Treaty and the agency had a safeguards agreement with Iraq
                    that covered the reactor, which at that point was soon to become operational. So
                    you can imagine the outrage over the Israeli attack. There were intense
                    discussions about what position the Board should take concerning the
                    attack.Should the Agency take the lead or was this a matter for the UN Security
                    Council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that on the Iraqi side that this
                        reactor and all that was being put up was a legitimate process or was it the
                        feeling that this was going to turn into a weapons producing plant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the reactor was ideally suited for producing weapons grade plutonium
                    and Iraq was seeking to obtain reprocessing equipment from France. That was one
                    perspective.The other was that the reactor was covered by IAEA safeguards, which
                    many saw as making its eventual operation legal. Another question was whether
                    the safeguards were effective.Were the Iraqis declaring the facilities and the
                    material in the facility properly to the agency?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned in Israel's nuclear program. Could you
                        explain what that was, is and what the agency might be trying to do
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Israel is not a party to the non-proliferation treaty. So the agency
                    didn't have any role there, but that didn't stop countries in the Middle East
                    who were concerned about Israel's nuclear program from asserting that the agency
                    ought to be involved and ought to be going out and trying to clarify what Israel
                    was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find people lined up or countries lined up on
                        this Israel thing? Were we kind of alone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: All I remember is that we were successful in preventing the Board from
                    condemning Israel. Just how we got to that outcome I would have to go back and
                    do some checking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then did you, how did working in the international
                        organization field, did that interest you or was it an interesting
                        sideline?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>BROWN: It was something I was glad that I had done so that I understood the
                    processes and how these organizations functioned and how business got done in
                    them, but it didn't fascinate me enough or entice me to apply for a job at the
                    UN. In fact, quite the opposite. Once was enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way these things are intensely political. It
                        sounds like working in or being in a legislature of some state or something
                        like that. You're trading, you're working, you're cajoling, the whole
                        thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you say, '81?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: '81, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '81, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I went to Beijing to head the economic section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from '81 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Until 1983. I respectfully commented to the people who had asked me to
                    head the economic section that, with the exception of some work on economics at
                    the Japan desk, I didn't have any economic experience or training. I was
                    delighted by the prospect of going to China, but wasn't certain I was the right
                    person for the job. The answer was that there wasn't a lot of economics in this
                    job. It would be much more about understanding the politics of how things get
                    done in China. They said it didn't bother them, please come along, we need
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember had you been in Beijing before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. I'd been in Taipei and worked on Mainland China in INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beijing in '81. What was it like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I arrived at a fortuitous time because the process of Deng
                    Xiaoping's reform and opening had started two years earlier. Just when I arrived
                    the Chinese government had decided to do what they called opening 40 cities to
                    travel by foreign diplomats. This meant that one no longer had to obtain Foreign
                    Ministry permission each time one wanted to leave Beijing to travel to these 40
                    cities. So, we were there at a time when you could get out and see the country.
                    It was also the beginning of the Reagan administration and that was the period
                    when U.S.-China relations had worsened because of Reagan's campaign rhetoric
                    about moving back toward an official relationship with Taiwan. So the political
                    aspects of U.S.-China relations were tense for most of the time I was there. The
                    economic relationship was starting from a low base, but was opening up rather
                    remarkably. Trade was growing. We were beginning to get into our deficits with
                    China. But the main thing was the trade was growing, and the economic
                    relationship was seen as a new positive element in what had been just a
                    strategic relationship until then. We in the Economic Section had a lot of
                    opportunities to meet with academics in the Chinese government who were
                    wrestling with the early stages of the reform effort. The Political Section
                    didn't have much luck getting out and meeting these academics. In those days,
                    when you went to see an official you had to call up to get his organization's
                    permission to interview him. It was very structured society, but the structure
                    was opening up on the economic side. We could travel, and the Economic Section
                    set out to write an economic profile of each of the provinces in China, taking
                    advantage of our new opportunity to send officers off for a week of interviewing
                    in the provinces. We wanted to see how reform policies adopted at the center
                    were actually being implemented in the field. We were also negotiating
                    agreements in the economic area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you negotiating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Textiles, aviation, tourism, ocean shipping. There were a lot of bilateral
                    negotiations going in this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a concern I mean we had done so much to turn
                        Japan into a viable state and an economic power and all, this is our policy.
                        All of a sudden we turn out with these huge deficits with Japan. Were we
                        seeing as we did this we might have created another deficit monster in
                        China?</hi>

                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BROWN: I don't recall that we saw China becoming a deficit monster, but it was
                    very clear to us that the restrictions that the Chinese had on their markets
                    combined with the openness of the American markets were leading in the direction
                    of deficits. At that time, the numbers were only in the hundreds of millions of
                    dollars. However, we were already in a situation where the Chinese statistics
                    painted a different picture from the American statistics. So we were in the
                    early stages of the debates about why this was so, trying to get the Chinese to
                    focus on the fact that this was going to be a problem and that, if they didn't
                    do something about the deficit, it was going to have an impact on the
                    relationship. This is a story that was only beginning at that point and it's
                    certainly not over yet.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How successful or unsuccessful were we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We were successful of course because we could simply put on restrictions
                    in those days if we judged that circumstances warranted it. However, we didn't
                    want to act arbitrarily. We wanted to handle it within the context of the
                    agreement and have the Chinese cooperating in managing the issue. Their textile
                    industry was growing rapidly, and there were problems of shipping goods out to
                    Hong Kong where they would be mislabeled and all sorts of shenanigans going on.
                    These were typical trade negotiations. Both sides were being very tough and the
                    embassy's role was to try and help the negotiators from Washington to get the
                    best deal we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you characterize the Chinese form of negotiating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The standard picture you have of Chinese negotiators is that they try and
                    establish basic principles that will shape the negotiation at the beginning.
                    They spend a great deal of time on tying to shape the parameters of the
                    negotiations so that once those have been set, then the specifics would be
                    easier to negotiate. The specifics of course were what Washington's negotiators
                    wanted to focus on.For the Chinese, there were “principles” involved in the
                    sense that the Chinese system was a planned managed economy, which they wanted
                    us to accept as a given. You saw this on the shipping issue where they were just
                    adamant that they had one major shipping company and it was going to control the
                    ports and it was going to do all of the coastal shipping along the Chinese coast
                    and that the role of foreign shipping was going to be very tightly regulated and
                    controlled.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we, there weren't Chinese ships that were going
                        to be plying along our coasts anyway, were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. What we wanted was for U.S. shippers to get into the ports, set up
                    their own loading and unloading facilities rather than using Chinese ones. We
                    were pressing them to permit American shippers to operate intermodal services
                    where we could not only ship things to the port, but also have a role in moving
                    them beyond the ports to the consumers and this was just unacceptable to the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was looking at the Chinese economy at that time, were
                        you seeing I mean what did it look like? Were there still these huge
                        government things sometimes run by the army or something like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the army's role wasn't very apparent at that time. In fact, the army
                    in those days was not involved in the economy per se beyond the particular
                    munitions industries that were linked to the military. In those days, China's
                    international trade was still controlled by a relatively small number of large
                    state trading companies that dealt with textiles or machinery or coal or so
                    forth. If you wanted to export to China you had to deal with those monopoly
                    companies. The process of reforming the Chinese economy had not gone very far at
                    that point. They had started the creation of special economic zones in South
                    China to promote a more open, free market approach to trade. Within these zones,
                    it wasn't the central trading company that you would deal with; you could
                    actually go deal with individual manufacturers or companies in these zones. You
                    could set up joint ventures in the zones, primarily to export from China but do
                    some sales in China too. The economy was just beginning to open up, but it was
                    still very heavily managed and a lot of what we did, in addition to negotiating
                    agreements, was to try and understand the process of reform and how it was being
                    debated internally within China and who was promoting reform and who was against
                    reform.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about companies, American companies coming to China?
                        Were we encouraging them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, we were working very hard to support them. In fact while I was there
                    the Commerce Department set up their first Foreign Commercial Service office in
                    China. We worked very hard to help companies get contracts and to lobby the
                    Chinese government on behalf of American businesses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that you would have been deluged by
                        people who would take one look, I don't know what the population was, but it
                        was probably approaching a billion at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BROWN: A little over a billion. China conducted its first census since the '50s
                    when we were there and it came out to about 1.1 billion</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always think about it, supposedly, I heard somewhere
                        where a casket maker in Ohio took one look and started doing a little
                        calculation and said, hey. In other words, there's always business, but I
                        think it goes back to the oil for the lamps of China and a book on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Add one inch to the garment of every Chinaman and you'll be rich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I mean and there is validity to this in the long run,
                        but you must have had to deal with an awful lot of people who were pretty
                        naive coming in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, but most of the people we dealt with were the large American
                    companies. There were also a number of small trading companies that had grown up
                    during the '70s when the relationship was beginning to open up, but before we
                    had full diplomatic relations. These were people who had been in China for a
                    period of time and were establishing personal ties with people in the
                    bureaucracy that dealt with economics. Law firms were also beginning to come in
                    at this time. Some banks were already well established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point, were companies sort of looking towards, you
                        know, right away making sizeable incomes or were they trying to establish
                        bridgeheads with the potential for something later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, you had both, but the mantra of everyone who had been involved in
                    China was that you had to adopt a long-term perspective because you're not going
                    to make money right off. You have to establish good business relationships and
                    then the opportunities will start opening up and you can make money. That was
                    the mantra, which was valid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you watching the rise of an entrepreneurial class
                        within China? I mean it's almost, it's the idea of saying an entrepreneurial
                        class developing. I mean the Chinese I think have it in their chromosomes.
                        Still you have this bureaucracy. Was there something coming out of the
                        bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>BROWN: You'll have to remember this was '81 to '83. Deng had only regained power
                    in December of 1978 and begun the reform process. Reform had started with
                    agricultural sector. There was change in land ownership arrangements and in the
                    way crop planting decisions were made. So, the thing that was very apparent when
                    one traveled around was that in certain parts of China, the Yangtze River Delta
                    and in Southern China, that farmers were able to take advantage of these looser
                    arrangements and that the countryside was really beginning to take off. You
                    could see evidence of prosperity in the form of new homes being built that were
                    dramatically better than what had been there earlier. What you did not see at
                    that point was the development of an urban entrepreneurial middle class. That
                    came later. Another thing you didn't see at that time was an open job market.
                    People could not easily move from one area of the country to another the way
                    they can now. If you were a college graduate, you were still allocated a job by
                    the state. You couldn't go out and obtain employment in a private company the
                    way Chinese can now. If a joint venture wanted to hire people, they would go to
                    a government service bureau that provided personnel to joint venture
                    organizations. The embassy had to do the same thing. It went to the Diplomatic
                    Services Bureau and was allocated Chinese employees to work in the embassy. A
                    lot of the things that eventually loosened up life for ordinary Chinese had not
                    occurred in '81, '82 or '83.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking, I mean we have our trade negotiations,
                        but were we looking at China at that time and seeing that the system that
                        you just described and other attributes of the same central thing was going
                        to have to dissolve and what would that leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. I'm trying to think of how to explain this. It's not that we didn't
                    think that there were some possibilities that this might happen over the long
                    term, but the system hadn't started changing enough that you really spent very
                    much time thinking about the implications of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess this is what they called the iron rice bowl or
                        what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, perhaps a better way to understand it is what they called the work
                    unit system. Every Chinese was assigned to a work unit. If you were in the rural
                    area you belonged to a cooperative. These cooperatives were breaking down and
                    people were having the right to lease over a long period of time, land that they
                    would then be responsible for developing under a contract between the family and
                    the local cooperative on what they should produce. If you lived in an urban area
                    your work unit was your university, your government organization, your factory,
                    and these organizations were generally involved lifetime employment.If a Chinese
                    wanted a house he would go to his work unit and they would allocate it. If he
                    needed medical care, he went to the clinic that was run by his work unit. If he
                    wanted to get married, he would ask permission of the work unit. When the couple
                    wanted to have children, they would ask the work unit for permission to have a
                    child.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was all a very controlled society and people yes knew that if China was
                    really going to reform itself all of these things would have to change, but in
                    '81, '82, '83 the change was only taking place in the rural areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you seeing as you traveled? I mean what was your
                        impression, I assume you did go out and did the usual Foreign Service thing
                        of going to a city and going out and looking at the steel mill and you know,
                        visiting the university and that sort of thing. Were you getting a sense
                        from the people a sense of excitement that things are beginning to change or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I did this. I visited Shenzhen, which was the special economic zone across
                    from Hong Kong. I had been up to the border in Hong Kong in the '60s and looked
                    across at what was basically rice fields. I came back in '81 a couple of years
                    after they had established this zone and in the zone you began to see a small
                    city taking shape.There were joint venture companies being established some of
                    which involved American companies. Such visits made it clear that something
                    really important was happening. I also visited Hunan, the province where Mao
                    Tse-tung had been born and spent a week going out into the countryside. One saw
                    an agricultural scene that was becoming more prosperous and a little loosening
                    of the controls on people. By contrast, if one went to North China, which is a
                    less fertile wheat growing area, one didn't see signs that life had changed very
                    much for people. So, it was a very, quite a mixed picture you would get
                    traveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were Taiwanese able to do any investment at that
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Taiwanese had permission to travel to the mainland. We knew that a certain
                    amount of investment was taking place. We knew that there was Taiwan money mixed
                    in with the money that was coming in from Hong Kong, but it wasn't a big factor
                    in the equation. Was the SEZ, the Special Economic Zone experiment in China
                    something that had at least some antecedents in the export processing zones,
                    which Taiwan had developed in the late '60s? Yes. People in China had been
                    looking around at what the Asian Tigers, including Taiwan, had been doing to
                    successfully develop their economies. The Chinese approach wasn't the same, but
                    it had some antecedents there. When one talked to Chinese academics or got
                    access to their internal publications, it was clear that they had studied these
                    things.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Reversion was in 1997.The agreement that started this process was

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, at that time Hong Kong was seen as an entree point or

                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your experience in dealing with the Chinese
                        bureaucracy different than say the political section, was it a different
                        breed of cat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, as I said, the economic relationship was growing at a time when
                    political relations were strained between the U.S. and China. The economic
                    section had more access. Positive things were happening, things the Chinese were
                    interested in and so we had easier entree into Chinese society than the people
                    in the political section did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the universities? Did you see these? Were they
                        kicking out pretty good people in the economic field, technical fields?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We did not have a great deal of contact with the universities. However,
                    this was the period when China resumed post-graduate education. That had
                    collapsed during the Cultural Revolution and no masters or doctor degrees had
                    been issued for about a decade. In '81 and '82 they began to graduate their
                    first classes of new Ph.D.'s. Things were happening in this area, but it wasn't
                    an area that the U.S. Embassy had a great deal of contact with at least not in
                    the economic section. We went to the economic research institutes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During part of this period, I was seconded as a consular
                        officer to the immigration and naturalization service and I remember every
                        morning I would get a copy of the student applications for or waivers for
                        students to come in. China was really beginning to deluge our institutions
                        with graduate students.</hi>

                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Yes, it was a sign that they were opening up. I don't remember the
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean obviously we're talking about a billion, you're not
                        talking about, but essentially there were a significant number of people
                        coming in at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes and it was significant because in the '50s, '60s, '70s, Chinese had
                    not gone to the West. They had gone, to the extent they had gone anywhere, to
                    the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc. So, something important was happening. Of
                    course, there was uncertainty about how many of the students who went overseas
                    were going to come back. Even though in the early days the Chinese government
                    was financing most of those who went.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: You've got a good memory. Yes, Hu Na, I believe. She defected while we
                    were there and this was one of the frictions in the relationship because she had
                    played tennis with one of the principal reform leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also were we noticing and was it true that the I
                        don't know what to call them, the cadre, in other words, the top dogs were
                        sending their children to the United States, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, they certainly are now. I don't recall that that pattern had
                    developed at that time. We did have some issues related to Taiwan that came back
                    on the economic side. One had to do with U.S. airlines. Could they fly both to
                    Taiwan and to the mainland? The answer at the time was yes. However, the
                    political tensions in the relationship threatened that pattern. The Chinese
                    tried to argue that if the airlines are going to expand in China those same
                    airlines couldn't be expanding their operations in Taiwan. There was also an
                    issue related to I think it was First Chicago Bank that was pressured by Beijing
                    to close their banking operations in Taiwan as the price of getting into China.
                    Then subsequently other banks got in without paying that price. So, part of what
                    we were trying to do was to argue with the Chinese that they shouldn't be
                    putting these political conditions on economic relationships.To the extent that
                    issues involved government-to-government agreements, i.e., in the aviation
                    field, we weren't going to tolerate that kind of conditionality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling in this time that the Reagan
                        administration was beginning to change its attitude towards China? I mean a
                        lot of administrations come in with an attitude and then when it brushes up
                        against reality and the sort of economic thing it begins to change.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, that was happening. It was happening next door in the political
                    section in the sense that during that period we were negotiating on arms sales
                    to Taiwan.You could see in the process of that how the Reagan administration was
                    adjusting to reality.Contrary to his campaign rhetoric, the administration
                    decided early on that it wouldn't try to restore an official relationship with
                    Taiwan and then they made the decision not to sell Taiwan in advance aircraft.
                    Then in order to get over the political problems in the relationship, the Reagan
                    administration agreed to negotiate a long term relationship on arms sales to
                    Taiwan. That resulted in something called the August 1982 communiqu�, which set
                    some broad parameters for how arms sales would be handled. What had happened was
                    that the Reagan administration had decided to drop a lot of the things that they
                    had been thinking about doing with Taiwan because they realized that China was
                    an important element in dealing with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we look upon other countries opening up and doing
                        economic things, commercial work with China? I mean did we find ourselves,
                        was it a rivalry or was everybody happily going about their business without
                        worrying about the others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was much more a cooperative endeavor to understand how China was
                    changing and how you could encourage movement in that direction. Was their
                    rivalry? Yes, there was some because you were still dealing with a country where
                    most decisions were being made by government organizations. Therefore, companies
                    needed their government's support. In parallel with that was a very close
                    cooperation in trying to understand what was going on inside China because it
                    was not a transparent decision-making process. When a German delegation would
                    get access to certain people that no American delegation had been able to meet,
                    you would trade notes with the Germans about what that particular person had
                    said and then compare it to what other people in other parts of the Chinese
                    bureaucracy were saying to Americans. The aim was to piece together this picture
                    of who was promoting what kind of reform and who was trying to delay which kinds
                    of reforms to get a picture of where things were going over the long term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the academic world in the United States and elsewhere
                        play much of a role as far as its understanding. I mean we'd had academics
                        of looking and reading stuff about China for eons practically, but was there
                        much, any relationship with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>BROWN: The place that I would say the embassy got the most insight was from the
                    World Bank. They Bank had been asked by the Chinese to come in and do a study of
                    how reforms could be promoted. One of the first things I read before I went was
                    a World Bank report that was literally a foot high. It had been written by
                    economists who had been given access to information, data, statistics, about the
                    Chinese economy, access to people who were involved in the planning process that
                    went beyond what anyone else had. The Bank was perceived as constructive and it
                    had large amounts of assistance to make available.The Chinese had to let them
                    inside the tent so to speak in order to get that money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Soviet Union a player in the game at this
                        point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They had in this period still very tense relationships with the Chinese.
                    The whole process of “normalizing” after the Sino-Soviet split had not taken
                    place at this point. The Soviets did have their old state trading relationship.
                    One did try to learn from their window of access into China, but they were not a
                    big player. I think, to look back in retrospect, it was the problems at the
                    beginning of the Reagan administration and the uncertainties about what the U.S.
                    was going to do with Taiwan that began to get the Chinese thinking about moving
                    towards a more independent foreign policy, i.e., one that wasn't so aligned with
                    the U.S. against the Soviets but was more independent. You heard some of that
                    rhetoric when I was there, but it wasn't until the end of the '80s that that all
                    coalesced.</p>

                        talked with Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: On the economic side, rarely. One exception was the civil aviation
                    negotiations, as I said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about while you were there dealing with the problem

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not a huge issue at that time, yes some companies felt they had to do some
                    things like this, but it was not a big issue in 1982.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Arthur Hummel was Ambassador and the DCM was Chas Freeman.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with, I'm just thinking of going back where we

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I replaced Chas on the Republic of China desk. He had been Burt Levin's
                    deputy and I took his place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he's quite a character in a way, isn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed him and it was almost I mean he, from memory
                        or just sort of dictated practically his.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. He has an extraordinary memory. He is sort of a modern version of
                    Teddy Roosevelt. He reads voraciously, remembers everything, intellectually very
                    dynamic, very strong willed, he knows what he wants to do.He and I live across
                    the hall from each other. So every morning I would ride to work with Chas. Every
                    morning he would try to tell me what to do during my day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I can believe that. What about living in Beijing in

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Erna and I had two small kids.</p>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BROWN: We loved it. As I said we could travel, not just officially, but
                    privately, Erna and the kids and I went on numerous trips around China. You
                    could go to restaurants. You could go visit temples. You could go and drive your
                    car out 20 miles into the countryside before you ran into the little signs
                    saying that diplomats weren't permitted to drive any farther without a permit.
                    You could get permits to go further a field. We could go to Beidaihe on the
                    coast in the summertime. We traveled down the Yangtze River and went through the
                    three gorges and into Inner Mongolia. It was a delightful time to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about apartment living and all that, how was
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: On average, when you arrived at the beginning of a two years assignment,
                    you spent about five to six months in a hotel waiting for an apartment because
                    the Chinese government hadn't built enough to deal with a rapidly expanding
                    diplomatic corps. That was very unpleasant. Once you got into your apartment and
                    got used to the fact that you were living on a diplomatic compound, you could
                    travel around the city very freely. You could get on your bicycle and go
                    anyplace you wanted. We took bike tours out to the Ming tombs. You could drive
                    to the Great Wall. You could go to the Forbidden City. You could go into art
                    galleries and antique stores. It was a fine time. A small school was operated in
                    the back of the embassy compound with about 100 kids. It had gotten to the point
                    where you didn't have to worry about educating your children when you were
                    serving in Beijing because of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Art Hummel of course way back he'd grown up in China. How
                        was he as ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: A wonderful man. Easy to work for. Of course most of my work was with Chas
                    and Chas wasn't so easy to work for, but Art was a delight as was his wife,
                    Betty Lou Hummel who worked very hard to maintain morale amongst the embassy
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he, Art Hummel, did he seem frustrated in dealing
                        with the Chinese bureaucracy and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Art was a taciturn individual who didn't open himself up a great deal. He
                    was very supportive if you had a problem you could get time with him. He would
                    listen and he would give you his advice, which was usually good advice. He was
                    wrestling the most of the time I was there with this whole arms sale thing and
                    how to work this out. There were only four people in the embassy who were
                    involved in this. They held it very tightly because of its sensitivity. If he
                    got angry and frustrated in that process it didn't wash off on the rest of
                    us.</p>

                <p>I might say it's funny how certain things stick in your mind. Dick Nixon came to
                    China while we were there. It would have been in '82, early '83 and spent two or
                    three days there. I very much recall that four or five of us spent about two
                    hours discussing U.S.-China relations with him. Nixon said what was music to the
                    ears of the economic section. He was convinced that things were changing in
                    U.S.-China relations and that in the future it was going to be, the economic
                    relationship that would become the real underpinning of the relationship, not
                    opposition to the Soviets. I remember that because he was the architect a decade
                    earlier of the opening to China, basing it largely on opposition to the Soviets.
                    Nixon was thinking ahead and recognizing that over the long-term economics would
                    be very much the center of U.S.-China relations. I'm not a great fan of Richard
                    Nixon, but he impressed us that night.</p>

                        of these interviews, Nixon basically impressed most of them by knowing, by
                        both knowing the situation, but also by thinking ahead, but also by
                        listening to people. I mean when he was in the outs and traveled around he
                        used to sit there and talk for hours and have a yellow pad and he'd be
                        taking notes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That two-hour session that we had with him would be an example of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We didn't ask for that meeting. He asked for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about delegations? China has always fascinated
                        Americans and I would think that you would find yourself deluged with
                        political types and other types coming there just to see the elephant kind
                        of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, that's true. There was what we called “death by duck.” Every
                    delegation that came Beijing had to go to the Peking Duck Restaurant for a
                    formal dinner either hosted by its Chinese host or, if they didn't take care of
                    it, the embassy was expected to make the arrangements. So, we went to duck
                    dinners about twice a week for the two years I was there. Delegations were a
                    very important part of what we were doing. They were the way deals were sealed
                    and the way you got access to senior leaders in the Chinese government. Art
                    Hummel could get access once in a while to senior leaders, but much of his
                    access came when he accompanied high level delegations that would get calls on
                    Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang or other leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then were there any sort of incidents or problems or
                        things that you haven't mentioned here that particularly strike you while
                        you were there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>BROWN: One thing that was interesting was an issue called the Hu-Kuang railway
                    bonds. These were bonds that had been issued just before the Chinese Revolution
                    in 1911. Some American speculators had bought up these depreciated bonds. After
                    we normalized relations with China, the speculators tried to hold the Chinese
                    government legally responsible for the prior obligations of all former Chinese
                    governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape four, side one with David Brown. Yes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We were talking about the Hu-Kuang railway bonds. These bonds were almost
                    70 years old and nothing had been paid on them for decades. After normalization,
                    the American bondholders went to court to compel the Chinese communist
                    government to accept responsibility for repayment of these loans. A court case
                    was started I think in Georgia. The U.S. government had to persuade the Chinese
                    government that they should go into U.S. court and make the arguments that they
                    were not legally bound to repay these debts of the Qing Dynasty. When this came
                    up you got an almost instinctive political reaction from the Chinese. Hell no,
                    we're not going to subject China to the jurisdiction of American courts on these
                    debts. We tried to explain to them, with the help of a delegation led by the
                    Department's Legal Advisor, why they had to go into U.S. courts. If they didn't
                    go into the U.S. courts, then the court might well grant the bondholders'
                    request. Then when the next Chinese aircraft arrived in the United States the
                    bondholders might put a lien on it for repayment on the bonds.When the U.S.
                    delegation arrived to have the discussions with the Chinese legal experts, who
                    were they? They were people who had studied law in the West in the 1930s. People
                    who had been on the outs for years; many of them were vilified during the
                    Cultural Revolution. But, China didn't have any other legal experts. While I was
                    there we never persuaded the Chinese to go into court. Fortunately, the Chinese
                    later did go into court and did make the case and the courts decided that the
                    American bondholders didn't have any claims in this particular instance. The
                    issue is not entirely dead however because I have heard that there are still
                    some of the bondholders trying to make another run at the issue now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, for years we used to hear about the Czarist war
                        bonds and I guess it is the same thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, the same kind of thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, you left Beijing in '83, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We went to Norway.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Norway, oh my God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There was a very simple reason why I would want to go to Norway and that
                    is because my wife is Norwegian and had worked in the Norwegian diplomatic
                    service. We had two young children and we wanted to expose them to that side of
                    their cultural heritage. A lot of luck was involved in getting an assignment to
                    be the head of the political section in Oslo. But I was successful in part
                    because I had taught myself some Norwegian and taken the language test at FSI to
                    prove that while transiting Washington on the way to China. We stayed in Oslo
                    for three years and in the last year I got to be DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there from '83 to '86. What were relations
                        with Norway when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Relations with Norway are normally quite trouble free. It's one of the
                    easiest relationships we have in the world not because our countries are
                    identical by any stretch of the imagination. It's hard to see too many parallels
                    between Norway and its view of the world and the U.S. view of the world, but
                    it's just a very harmonious relationship. The big issue while I was there was
                    intermediate nuclear forces, INF. This was taking place against the backdrop in
                    Norway of a period when the country was ruled by a center-right coalition
                    government led by the Conservative Party. So, we had in office people who were
                    relatively well disposed towards the United States and towards cooperation with
                    the U.S.Nevertheless, the INF issue was a challenge. If you remember the INF
                    debate for several years really dominated U.S. European relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just in context the Soviets have introduced an
                        intermediate missile the SS20 and the idea of that, that put Europe under
                        the gun, but not the United States under the gun and we were going to
                        respond with intermediate missiles and cruise missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right and deploy those INF missiles in Europe and do so in a way that many
                    in Europe thought was going to increase East-West tensions rather than reduce
                    them. The challenge was both to persuade people that the Soviet missiles were a
                    real additional threat and that the deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe was
                    the way to deal with that threat.So, that I would say was the biggest political
                    issue in the three years I was there, and it split the Norwegians. The issue
                    became linked with Reagan's strategic defense initiative, SDI.Both of the issues
                    were acceptable to conservatives in Norway and but appalled those on the center
                    and left side of the political spectrum. As I said, for most of my tenure, there
                    was a center-right government in Norway and relations with them were quite
                    cooperative and collaborative. What we had to do was try and sell U.S. views on
                    INF and then subsequently on SDI in as sophisticated to the Norwegian public to
                    make it easier for the government to maintain political support for supporting
                    U.S. policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there, were the conservatives in control the
                        whole time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. Labor came back in. I can't remember exactly when, but I think for the
                    last year I was there a Labor government was in office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did that make a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It made a difference because the Labor people were much more skeptical
                    about both of these programs, which they saw as moving Europe in the wrong
                    direction. They believe that Europe was changing, or alt least had the potential
                    to move in a different direction. This was before the Berlin Wall collapsed,
                    three or four years before that, but there was a sense with the Helsinki
                    process, that Europe East and West was changing and that there were
                    opportunities here to build bridges. Also both SDI and INF were seen as efforts
                    by a conservative American government, not to build bridges with the Soviet
                    Union, but to confront and overpower the Soviet Union. So, it was a very hard
                    sell with the Labor Party side that either one of these programs were really in
                    Europe's interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, this a tale of two ambassadors. One appalling and one very good. The
                    appalling one was Mark Evans Austad and the very good one was Robert Stuart.
                    Mark Evans Austad as the name implies was a man of Norwegian descent, a Mormon
                    who had done his Mormon mission work as a youth in Norway in the '30s in a
                    period when Hitler was rising in Germany. He was a profoundly conservative man
                    who was convinced that the Labor Party and the left of the Norwegian political
                    spectrum were the equivalent of Chamberlain in the '30s. That these were naive
                    idealists who had no comprehension of the real danger of the Soviet Union. He'd
                    been through this before because he'd been in Norway at the time of appeasement
                    of Nazism in Europe and so he just had it in for the left in Norway. This was
                    eventually his undoing or part of his undoing. He attacked them so vigorously.
                    Even Conservatives in Norway thought that he was being obsessive and acting in a
                    way that was inappropriate for an American ambassador.</p>
                <p>His problems were compounded by his personal weaknesses. One weakness was
                    alcohol, which was particularly hard for a Mormon to admit. He had one
                    absolutely horrendous incident when he went up to Northern Norway for an embassy
                    arranged trip. The officer who was stationed in Northern Norway at the time took
                    him around for the day and then to dinner and eventually to a bar.At about
                    11:00, the officer decided that he had had enough and Ambassador Austad in the
                    bar.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Well, the next day or later that night, Ambassador Austad went to visit an old
                    friend. This was at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. He was drunk and by mistake he
                    went to the house next door to his friend's house and pounded on the door
                    yelling and screaming and woke up the people in the house. The neighbors
                    eventually called the police who came to arrest him for disorderly conduct. The
                    Ambassador then threatened the police that he was the American ambassador and
                    that if they arrested him he was going to bring the wrath of America down on
                    little Norway. This was a very unpleasant incident for the embassy. Ambassador
                    Austad tried to insist that the embassy go up and threaten the local police to
                    expunge all of this from the records, the police reports. He convinced himself
                    that this was all a leftist plot against him. He tried to write articles to be
                    published in conservative media in the States blaming this incident on leftists
                    in Norway.</p>
                <p>I think a large part of it was that as a Mormon he just couldn't admit that he
                    had a drinking problem. This incident combined with his more considered attacks
                    on the labor politicians eventually led to a two hour debate in the Norwegian
                    Storting about his performance as American ambassador and whether it was
                    appropriate for any ambassador to be saying the kinds of things that he was
                    saying. This brought the issue to a head in Washington, and Reagan decided to
                    recall him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was his power, why was he a political
                        appointee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He was a political appointee who had been ambassador to Finland and had
                    apparently done a reasonably good job there during the first Reagan
                    administration. He was appointed in the second Reagan administration as
                    ambassador to Norway. His tenure was very painful for people in the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you handle this I mean, you know, you realize
                        you've got a problem here, but with a political appointee it's not let's
                        call the inspectors in and all. I mean, but were the inspectors called?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>BROWN: No. It went on at two levels. One was informally between the DCM; a real
                    gentleman named Ron Woods, who lives up in Seattle now. Woods Did a lot of back
                    channel over the telephone description to what was going on to people in
                    Washington. The other level was formal reporting, that we had to handle
                    carefully.We report what was in the Norwegian press and we made sure that
                    everything was translated by our locals and then cabled or faxed back to
                    Washington so that they would have the record. In particular, I remember
                    reporting thoroughly on the Storting debate and the press commentary that
                    followed. I had been tipped off that the debate was planned.So, as political
                    counselor I went down and took copious notes for reporting. Then subsequently I
                    actually got the transcript from the Norwegian Storting and had the whole thing
                    translated into English and sent back to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he approve this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, some of the things he knew we were doing, but with Woods blessing I
                    signed the reports out. Other things he was unaware of, such as the transcript
                    of the Storting debate. We were trying to build a case in Washington for his
                    recall, to do it by letting the Ambassador hang himself and to do this without
                    Ron Woods actually being thrown out. Fortunately it all worked out.</p>
                <p>Then the irony of this was that he was replaced by Robert Stuart who had been the
                    chairman of Quaker Oats. A fine man but one who had no connection to Norway
                    before his nomination.I can remember taking his biography and the agrement
                    request to the Foreign Ministry. The chief of protocol to whom I was giving this
                    and who was a very good friend, said, “What are you Americans doing sending us
                    another one of these people who know nothing about Norway?” I said, “Well, we
                    just had one that claimed to know a lot. Why don't you give this guy a chance
                    and see how he works out?” Actually Robert Stuart worked out extraordinarily
                    well.</p>

                <p>BROWN: That part of his life I had not been aware of. He was a conservative man.
                    He encouraged all of us in the embassy to read the Wall Street Journal, which I
                    do, but he was a great proponent of the editorial page of the Wall Street
                    Journal. Yet, he was a very sophisticated man ho listened to his staff. He was
                    there during the transfer of government from the Conservatives to the Labor
                    Party. He had worked with us after he arrived to build bridges to the Labor
                    Party. So he knew them and had developed personal relationships with Gro Harlem
                    Bruntland before she returned to office as Prime Minister. Stuart was a
                    marvelous ambassador who has kept up his ties with Norway after retiring. He has
                    sponsored scholarships for students to be exchanged between the two countries
                    and ended up marrying a Norwegian, as you know after his first wife passed away.
                    He started from ground zero with no real credentials or qualifications. While
                    most American ambassadors to Oslo have something in their background that links
                    them to Scandinavia, and Stuart had no ties and proved to be one of the most
                    effective ambassadors we had.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the while you were there the intermediate force
                        issue play out or did it play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, first of all, none of these missiles were being deployed in Norway.
                    So, while Norway was thus on the periphery of the issue, they were a member of
                    NATO and had to be part of the decision making process. They had to go along
                    with deployments and the government had to be able to explain what it was doing
                    to its public. In the end we got through all these issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Norwegian relations with Sweden
                        because Sweden for a long time was playing the usual card and relations
                        weren't great with the United States for a considerable period? I don't know
                        how they were at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't recall any serious issues like the ones under Palme during the
                    Vietnam War. My recollection is that we saw these relationships as a
                    constructive element in Nordic cooperation that did not directly affect U.S.
                    relations with either country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any concerns about the Soviet presence in the
                        Kola Peninsula I mean that's obviously a very big, was a very big area for
                        the Soviet nuclear submarines.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>BROWN: We had a very important and cooperative intelligence relationship with the
                    Norwegian military that was very much focused on keeping track of the comings
                    and goings of the Soviet fleet. So, that was one aspect of it. Another aspect
                    had to do with Soviet interest in this very northern part of Europe,
                    particularly in Svalbard which is an island north of the Nordic Peninsula which
                    is Norwegian territory but covered by an international agreement that date way
                    back to the '20s under which the Soviets have coal mining rights on the eastern
                    half of that island. There was a fair amount of attention to how the Soviets
                    were putting pressure on the Norwegians in Svalbard. What were they doing up
                    there and were the Norwegians vigorously asserting their sovereignty in trying
                    to keep an eye on what the Soviets were doing.</p>
                <p>Then while I was there, there was a major spy case. A man named Arne Treholt who
                    was a legal expert in the Norwegian Foreign Ministry was found to have been on
                    the Soviet payroll. It shocked Norway that one of their bright well-connected
                    young officials was working for the Soviets for so long. He had had a public
                    image as an earnest person trying to find ways to build bridges with the Soviet
                    Union and to deal with issues in a way that was cooperative rather than
                    confrontational. This fit right into the leftist view of what Norway ought to be
                    doing. Low and behold one of their best and brightest was found to be on the
                    Soviet payroll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something that you just observed or stay out
                        of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The Norwegians handled the investigation, arrest and trial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Norwegian oil? Did that give Norway the ability
                        to sort of distance themselves or go its own way if it wanted to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, with respect to Europe. North Sea oil was booming while we were
                    there. This was an important element in U.S.-Norwegian economic relations.
                    American companies were involved in developing some fields.Yes, you're right, it
                    had a big impact on Norway's perception of its role in the world. Before our
                    arrival, Norway had held its first referendum on joining the European Union and
                    voted against joining.The second referendum, also against joining, was in the
                    1990s after we had left. I think that a major part factor that made Norwegians
                    comfortable in staying out of the EU was its oil. While we were there we were
                    watching the beginning of the debate in Norway about whether there should be a
                    second referendum.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a feeling about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>BROWN: Naturally, this was an issue for Norway to decide. Nevertheless, we
                    thought it would be sensible for Norway to be part of Europe. This could help
                    consolidate its relationship with NATO, which was important to the U.S. It might
                    help with opening the Norwegian market in certain areas where they were quite
                    protectionist. But the discussion was very preliminary and the second referendum
                    didn't come until about a decade later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we look to Norway as an ally in dealing in the United
                        Nations on issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We would consult with them a lot and generally felt that they were
                    supportive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about whaling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I shouldn't be flippant in my next comment. Whales and apples and turkeys
                    were examples of the kinds of issues the embassy had to manage. With the
                    exception of INF and SDI, which were important political issues, there were not
                    many other significant issues. Whaling was one of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the issue was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, environmental groups in the United States were convinced that the
                    global moratorium on whaling ought to be maintained. Norway had a traditional
                    whaling fishery that was quite important to the people along the coast. It
                    involved a relatively small whale, the minke whale, not one of the behemoths
                    that are in the public mind. Norwegians were convinced that the minke whale was
                    not in danger. There were tens of thousands of these whales, and the Norwegian
                    whaling effort would not imperil this particular whale's existence. The issue
                    recurred each year. It had to be managed, because it couldn't be solved to
                    everyone's satisfaction.The Norwegians did start a limited “research” program on
                    how the stock was doing. They would of course then sell the meat domestically,
                    but not export it. At least that's my recollection of what they were doing at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turkeys and apples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Apples were a product, which we thought we could sell into the Norwegian
                    market. This was a market where Norway had a small number of apple growers who
                    received protection in part to protect small rural communities. The Norwegian
                    government was concerned about maintaining employment in rural areas and that
                    was the basis of a lot of Norwegian protectionism. Apples happened to be a
                    commodity that we thought we could export to Norway if they weren't so
                    protectionist.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>The turkeys came up at Thanksgiving because there was a blanket ban on the
                    importation of American turkeys into Norway. So, what do you do at Thanksgiving
                    and Christmas? We were always trying to work deals to bring in a limited number
                    of turkeys for Americans at the NATO base and at the embassy. If we could do
                    that, couldn't we also bring in enough for others in the American community?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the problem with the turkeys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The ban on the importation of turkeys, if I recall it correctly, was
                    designed to protect chicken producers. Anyway, it was a delightful time. It was
                    one of the best assignments that my family and I had and in '86 it had to come
                    to an end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, I think this is a good place to stop. '86,
                        whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Then I went back to the Department, to the Taiwan Coordination Staff,
                    which was the new name for the old Republic of China desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, we'll pick that up in '86 then. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 8th of April 2003. David, you've gone in 1986 to deal with the
                    Republic of China or what did we call it then?</p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the government calls itself the Republic of China. We call the
                    office that we set up in the State Department to deal with them after
                    derecognition the Taiwan Coordination Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '86 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: '89.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '89. All right, well, what I think it behooves you to
                        explain a bit about how we dealt with Taiwan at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>BROWN: Right. In January of 1979, we had recognized China and derecognized
                    Taiwan. This was shortly after I had left the Office of Republic of China
                    Affairs in '78. We set up an unofficial organization to represent the American
                    people in Taiwan called the American Institute in Taiwan. AIT had a headquarters
                    office in Washington and an office in Taipei and another one in Kaohsiung in the
                    southern part of Taiwan. We had a small office within the State Department
                    building whose job was to develop policy and provide instructions to AIT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now which one did you belong to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I belonged to the policy office within the State Department. The office of
                    the Taiwan Coordination Staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in the State Department did this function in all
                        aspects as a desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, except that there was no other desk that had an unofficial
                    organization in Washington to conduct liaison on its behalf. Whenever a
                    prominent visitor from Taiwan arrived, it was the chairman of the American
                    Institute in Taiwan office in Washington, D.C. who was responsible for greeting
                    them and going to dinner with them and chairing unofficial meetings for those
                    visitors with people from the administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a term that is used in illicit
                        relationships as a beard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Or a front group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A front group. However, that did not mean we were cutting
                        Taiwan loose. American interests in Taiwan changed little.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely. If you look back at decade of the 1980s after de-recognition,
                    this was a period of great success and development for Taiwan. Relations with
                    the U.S., though unofficial, were quite stable and strong. In short, Taiwan
                    continued to enjoy the stability that it needed to prosper and develop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, in 1986 when you went there, what was the situation
                        on Taiwan economically and politically in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, there were the two big economic issues in U.S.-Taiwan relations
                    then. Taiwan enjoyed huge trade surplus with the United States in the mid-1980s.
                    One issue was should Taiwan continue to benefit from our general system of
                    preferences (GSP) when they were a remarkably powerful export economy. At that
                    time, Taiwan's GDP per capita was around $10,000. Should Taiwan be graduated out
                    of a program that was designed to benefit developing countries?</p>
                <p>The other issue involved the valuation of Taiwan's currency, the new Taiwan
                    dollar. Their currency was very carefully controlled, and Treasury was convinced
                    that Taipei was using their currency control system to maintain an undervalued
                    new Taiwan dollar. The undervaluation was seen as a major reason for their
                    massive trade surplus with the U.S. The Treasury Department and we on the desk
                    cooperated in pressuring the Taiwan government into appreciating the currency.
                    There were some interesting unintended consequences of doing this. What Treasury
                    did was to persuade Taiwan that its economy had matured to the point where
                    Taiwan could afford to remove some of its currency controls and allow people in
                    Taiwan to move currency in and out more freely.The by-product of this was that
                    after these currency reforms were put in place Taiwanese started to invest
                    overseas. They invested in the U.S., in Southeast Asia. However, the big thing
                    that no one had anticipated was Taiwanese started to invest in China. That began
                    to open up relations between the island and the mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the result of this sort of freeing the
                        Taiwanese to invest where they will? Was anybody looking at this in the East
                        Asian bureau saying this is a good thing? In fact, it probably was one of
                        the greatest determiners of the China-Taiwan relationship. If China gets too
                        huffy, it may jeopardize all the nice investment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We were thinking about it, but I certainly didn't anticipate the extent to
                    which Taiwan's investment in China would take off. We knew that President Chiang
                    Ching-kuo had made a major decision to allow people from Taiwan to travel to the
                    mainland. It happened that he did that some months before with the 15th
                    anniversary of the Shanghai Communiqu�. We knew that this opening up of travel
                    to China was a very important thing that would have long-term consequences.
                    Secretary Shultz took the occasion of the 15th anniversary to make a statement
                    in which we said that it was U.S. policy not to get involved in cross-strait
                    negotiations, but to encourage an environment in which such cross-strait
                    contacts could develop.We understood there was a process going on that was very
                    important. However, I for one certainly didn't understand that what we were
                    doing with Treasury to open Taiwan's exchange rate system for the purpose of
                    correcting our trade deficit would have the side effect of stimulating massive
                    foreign direct investment by Taiwan and that a good portion of that foreign
                    direct investment would go to China.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Well, I was working in the State Department, so no, I did not. People who
                    worked for AIT, whether they were working in Taipei or in Washington, had to go
                    through a process of resignation from the State Department and employment with
                    the American Institute in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could the AIT people come at will to the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. However, Taiwan's representatives and visiting officials could not
                    come to the State Department. The American employees of AIT came to State like
                    any other government employee. They had their own State Department badges. What
                    was important was that appearances were changed. They were publicly called AIT
                    employees. The appearance or form of our relations with Taiwan changed, but the
                    substance did not change much.As for AIT employees, they continued to get their
                    paychecks in exactly the same fashion they'd gotten them before from the
                    Department. Every one of them had employee evaluations. When I was on the
                    coordination staff, some AIT employees received State Department awards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, it was policy guidance. How was the relationship with Taiwan
                    conducted? This was a big part of our role in the exchange rate issue. Normally
                    Treasury doesn't let State have anything to do with exchange rate negotiations.
                    An ambassador is lucky if he knows that they're even taking place.But because
                    Treasury was aware that they couldn't send their senior officials to Taipei,
                    they had to come to us to work out ways to deal with Taiwan. Treasury did not
                    let us in on the substance of their discussions, but we worked with them on the
                    process, and that proved to be quite important. Who in Taiwan should Treasury
                    deal with? Where can Treasury talk to them? Under what arrangements can we deal
                    with them? What form can an agreement or understanding with Taiwan take? Those
                    were issue on which we got involved. Also, Treasury had important relationships
                    with China at the same time. They were very much involved in U.S. economic ties
                    with the mainland. So, they didn't want to jeopardize those relationships any
                    more than State wanted to. So, one question was: do you want to deal with
                    exchange rates by sending a lower ranking official? If so, State could help make
                    Taiwan understand that this person came with considerable authority if not rank.
                    Did Treasury want to work this issue by inviting more senior officials from
                    Taiwan to meet in San Francisco under some private guise? If so, State could
                    help ensure that it was arranged quietly in a way that would not create problems
                    for either Treasury or State in their dealings with Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Taiwan? During the time you were dealing with
                        this, were their intelligence efforts a problem, I mean looking at the
                        overseas community? Because they messed around a bit in New York, I mean in
                        Los Angeles I believe. How did we see it at that time you were doing
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>BROWN: The really egregious thing that happened took place two years before I
                    came back to work on Taiwan. This was the murder of Henry Liu, a Taiwan
                    journalist who had moved to the United States and had written a critical
                    biography of Chiang Ching-kuo. Someone in the Taiwan intelligence chain of
                    command decided that the way to deal with somebody who had criticized Chiang was
                    to have him eliminated by gangsters of the so-called bamboo gang. Intelligence
                    officers hired the bamboo gang to murder Henry Liu. It took a while for this to
                    come to light. The U.S. had evidence on the involvement of intelligence officers
                    in the murder, and this forced Taipei to address the issue of responsibility.
                    The former head of Taiwan's intelligence service in the U.S. was convicted of
                    involvement. It still is not clear how high up people were involved in the
                    incident. President Chiang was acutely embarrassed. He eventually made very
                    significant changes in his intel services. The murder was a huge black mark for
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Now there were other things that they were doing, none of which were as egregious
                    as that. Taiwan continued to surveil Chinese students in the United States. They
                    had intelligence operations going and efforts to acquire restricted arms
                    technology that we were not authorizing for sale. The most serious example of
                    that was a program to get inertial guidance for long range missiles from the
                    U.S., technology that we had denied them. Taiwan arranged to have some of their
                    scientists come to the U.S. and get training and then they picked up the
                    designs. That had to be dealt with while I was on the desk. I recall we also put
                    them on the FBI watch list for hostile foreign intelligence organizations. They
                    got the message and over time changed the pattern of what they were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's take getting the long-range guidance system.
                        You said that had to be dealt with, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I recall that the most important thing we did was to terminate visas
                    for all the scientists that were involved in the training program, send those
                    people back to Taiwan and force the university that was running the program,
                    which I recall was MIT, to terminate those programs which were inconsistent with
                    U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you allowed to have contact with the Taiwanese staff
                        here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, but not in the State Department building, I had frequent breakfasts,
                    lunches and dinners with them. When circumstances required, AIT would arrange
                    for a negotiation or signing of an agreement. We had no problem dealing with
                    Taiwanese political groups that would come to the United States. We'd simply go
                    to see them in a restaurant rather than in the State Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like one would eat very well on that job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: During much of that time, I was working for Gaston Sigur who was the
                    Assistant secretary. Taiwan's representatives in Washington were Fred Chien and
                    later Ding Mou-shih, both of whom went on to be foreign ministers. Whenever they
                    had a meeting with Gaston, it was usually held over breakfast at the Four
                    Seasons Hotel. We ate well and had a lot of pretty heavy conversations to go
                    along with the fare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the nationalist Chinese
                        representation here in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We were fortunate to be dealing with quite sophisticated individuals. As
                    would be expected, we were under steady pressure from them to make the
                    relationship more official. For example, they would propose changing the kinds
                    of license plates their offices and officials could use. Diplomatic plates were
                    not possible, so they pressed local jurisdictions to create special plates for
                    them. Taipei was always trying to get a pseudo official status for their
                    offices. Could they fly their flag outside their office or just inside the
                    office? What titles could their officers use? This was a period of booming trade
                    between the U.S. and Taiwan. Many U.S. states wanted trade offices in Taiwan.
                    Taiwan would be as generous possible in providing benefits and special
                    privileges for those state representatives in Taipei, and then they would turn
                    around and go to the state's governor and say they would like similar treatment
                    in the U.S. Lacking formal diplomatic recognition, Taiwan had a deep desire for
                    the most formal treatment they could persuade people to give them. Dealing with
                    this, and coordinating with local governments was a constant challenge. It
                    wasn't done in a mean spirited way, but we had to hold the line on the
                    unofficial nature of our relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about consular protection? I'm thinking of all the
                        Taiwanese students in the United States and visitors and businessmen and the
                        normal thing is you need I'm in trouble with the police or something, call
                        you consul.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>BROWN: We had the American Institute in Taiwan represent us in Taipei. Taipei had
                    an organization with a convoluted name called the Coordination Council for North
                    American Affairs (CCNAA) to represent Taiwan in exactly the same way in the
                    United States. They had an office in Washington and about 11 or 12 branch
                    offices in American cities. In one of the more mean spirited aspects of
                    switching relations, we told Taiwan, a country which had more consulates, formal
                    consulates as opposed to honorary consulates, than just about any other country
                    in the U.S. that several of these consulates had to be closed. This was one of
                    the things that would to have to change with the termination of diplomatic
                    relations. So, we squeezed them down from 16 to 12, I recall. Nevertheless they
                    retained a very extensive network of CCNAA offices around the country that
                    operated exactly like consulates except that they didn't have consular status.
                    Their personnel enjoyed privileges and immunities similar to those accorded
                    consular personnel.We had similar needs in Taiwan, so we wanted the arrangements
                    to work effectively for both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I interviewed Nat Belocchi and Nat was saying that if
                        you think that the Israelis have a lobby or a network in the United States,
                        wait until you run across the nationalist Chinese. How did you find it sort
                        of business everywhere? Was this a pretty significant group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They were and are extremely active in cultivating good feelings amongst
                    Americans toward Taiwan. They considered themselves a very vulnerable society
                    and they recognize that the U.S. was their principal supporter. Hence, they did
                    everything they could to cultivate friendship among Americans. I'm excluding
                    from this the intelligence operations, and talking just about legitimate
                    diplomacy. Under our international visitor program, we would bring 15 or 20
                    people a year from Taiwan for month long visits to expose them to American
                    society, just as we did everywhere else. Similarly Taipei was targeting people
                    who would 20 years later be in leadership positions in the U.S. But, Taiwan had
                    programs, which were much larger than ours. They were bringing hundreds of
                    people to Taiwan every year, through every conceivable kind of arrangement. At
                    one level they were inviting members of congress. They had an extensive program
                    of congressional staff visits. They did the same thing at the state level
                    working through their local offices. They were inviting state legislators, staff
                    members of state governments, staffs of governors around the country. They had
                    an operation with the democratic and republican parties where political parties
                    in Taiwan, mainly the KMT, would invite delegations from those party
                    organizations at the national levels and at the state levels to Taiwan. They had
                    visits from professional groups; they had visits from academics. Then when the
                    visitors came back, CCNAA would follow up, maintain contact and seek these
                    people's help. Their friends are never forgotten. They are always invited to
                    lunches and dinners and parties when visiting delegations come the connections
                    are kept up so that a massive effort to cultivate good will and support in this
                    country for Taiwan because Taiwan is so dependent on American political and
                    military support. Then when help was needed, Taiwan was not shy in asking for
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>What was and is different is that Israel had a large and active domestic
                    political lobby in the Jewish community. While the Chinese community in the U.S.
                    was growing, it was not politically active and was split between pro-Beijing,
                    Pro-KMT and Taiwan independence groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a sense of unease in the East Asian bureau?
                        Were the people dealing with China per se because I mean just looking at it
                        from the outside, here is this active office doing this thing making
                        cultivating, also the fact is that Taiwan was turning into a democracy. When
                        you say democracy, this rings all sorts of bells in the United States and it
                        was not a fake one. I mean this is a real thing and yet you know, you had
                        China, which wasn't going in that direction at all. Sort of almost a
                        frustration or something of the Mainland China hands within our State
                        Department kind of wishing you'd go away or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We'll things were different in the mid-1980s. I think the phenomena you're
                    describing are of the '90s. Why do I say that? First because in the mid-'80s the
                    democratic transformation in Taiwan was only just beginning. There still were
                    political prisoners from the Kaohsiung incident in jail. There were more
                    congressional hearings on human rights in Taiwan. The real process of political
                    reform in Taiwan began actually in 1986 but wasn't completed until much later
                    with the first direct election of the Taiwan president in 1996 and the first
                    transfer of power to the opposition in 2000. In '86, '87, '88 this process was
                    just beginning. On the mainland, it was a period when economic reform was seen
                    in this country as promising. There were student demonstrations in China in 1987
                    that were significant enough to cost party Secretary General Hu Yaobang his
                    job.So, the contrast between what was going on in the mainland and what was
                    going on in Taiwan wasn't as stark then as it was later.</p>

                <p>BROWN: You could say that before Tiananmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, was there still this almost coterie who had
                        participated in the opening to China who identified so much with mainland
                        China that they tended to be dismissive or forget about Taiwan? I mean was
                        that still an attitude or did this work itself out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>BROWN: At that time, the Republican administration had good relations with Taiwan
                    and quite positive attitudes toward the island. Taiwan felt that it was well
                    connected with the Reagan and subsequently with the Bush establishments in
                    Washington. Holbrooke had been dismissive of Taiwan, but the Republican
                    administrations were not. The first person I worked for was Jim Lilley who had
                    been our representative, the head of AIT in Taipei. He believed that if you
                    wanted to manage the U.S.-China relationship as a whole correctly you had to
                    take very good care of your ties in Taiwan. If one didn't take good care of the
                    ties in Taiwan then the Taiwans were going to use this network that they had
                    cultivated, most importantly in the congress, to put pressure on the
                    administration to do things that would not be in the U.S. interest.</p>

                        sometimes gets a little bit rocky. How did this one go regarding your

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: All the time, and we were going through all sorts of shenanigans you might
                    call them to provide Taiwan with the weapons it needed in ways that did not
                    provoke the PRC and also, to the best of our ability, could be seen as
                    consistent with the language of the communiqu� that had been negotiated with the
                    Chinese in 1982. The August '82 communiqu� on arms sales said that there were
                    limits on the quantity and quality of arms we would sell to Taiwan. So, we had
                    to try and live within that framework, but the framework was being stretched
                    beyond credibility by technological change. Taiwan's weapons systems were
                    becoming obsolescent and had to be replaced and the only way you could replace
                    them was by providing newer more capable systems. Subsequently, after I left, we
                    bumped up against the quantitative ceiling as well as the quantitative one with
                    the sale of F-16s. The F-16s clearly were a more capable system, and they were
                    so expensive that there was no way they could be provided within the
                    quantitative limitations either.</p>

                        of aircraft, navy, etc. and what the Taiwanese had and making sure that the
                        Taiwanese were able to have a credible defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>BROWN: Sure. Studies were done of the military balance in the Taiwan straits.
                    State, DOD and NSC had to weigh what could be sold that would meet Taiwan's
                    legitimate defense needs and how to do it in a way that would not create
                    problems in our relations with the PRC. One key was to keep what we were doing
                    out of the public eye. Appearances were important to the PRC. Consequently, what
                    systems were called was important.For instance, Taiwan wanted the M-60 tank. We
                    sold them an equivalent but called it a hybrid M-48, the M-48H. I'm using an
                    army system here as an example, though it was not the most important weapon we
                    were selling Taiwan. I could have used the frigate that we had agreed to sell.
                    In that case, we devised a program whereby Taiwan could manufacture in Taiwan
                    new frigates that were better than the old World War II vintage ones that were
                    being replaced. Clearly this would involve a qualitative improvement. Rather
                    than selling them these ships outright in a way that would be seen as a
                    violation of the arms sales communiqu�, we worked out an arrangement to provide
                    the plans and build the ships in Taiwan. These ships would then be outfitted
                    with modern weapons systems. This met their defense needs with less strain on
                    our relations with China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other countries on this arms thing? Could you
                        say the French and all, were they and other countries, were the Taiwanese
                        shopping around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Taiwan was out looking all the time, but very few countries were prepared
                    to sell to them. The Israelis would provide some things. They got some systems
                    from the Italians, and believe it or not from the Swedes. The sellers would try
                    to handle the sales in a way that didn't attract publicity or create problems
                    for their relations with China. The really big third country sale again came
                    after I left. This was the French decision to sell frigates and 60 mirage
                    fighters to Taiwan.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Well, as an economic competitor in Taiwan. For a variety of reasons, Japan
                    did not have any defense ties with Taiwan. Certainly on the political level,
                    they kept a very low profile and were determined to avoid problems in their
                    relations with the PRC.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this '86 to '89 period did you find, had the

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In that context, the most important thing that happened followed the death
                    of Chiang Ching-kuo in 1988. Lee Teng-hui, the vice President, succeeded him and
                    became the first Taiwanese to reach a real position of power in Taiwan.This was
                    a revolutionary change. Most people at that time thought Lee was a lightweight
                    who would not last. It was similar to the way people thought about Jiang Zemin
                    when he was appointed General Secretary in Beijing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or Anwar Sadat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. Well, Lee transformed Taiwan politics and is still having a major
                    impact now as a former president. However, in the years I was on the desk, he
                    started very cautiously. He had to be careful because even though he inherited
                    the presidency, he did not inherit automatically the chairmanship of the
                    Nationalist Party. That was the really powerful position in the political system
                    at that time. The first thing Lee had to do was to get himself appointed acting
                    chairman of the party and that was in fact opposed by Chiang family loyalists,
                    including Madame Chiang Kai-shek who was then in her late 80s. She had returned
                    to Taiwan, in 1986 I think, out of concern that Chiang Ching-kuo might go too
                    far in liberalizing the political system. She was there when he passed away.
                    She, her son Chiang Wei-kuo and some others tried to prevent Lee from being
                    given the title of acting chairman of the party.Reform elements in the party
                    blocked that effort and Lee became acting chairman. Lee had to consolidate his
                    position and prove to people that he was going to be around for a while. He
                    moved forward with Ching-kuo's program for initial political reform and
                    subsequently carried that process much further in the 1990s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this looked upon with favor in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, definitely. Washington's positive response went back to 1986 when
                    Ching-kuo was beginning to signal his willingness to conduct political reform in
                    Taiwan. His biggest signal was when opposition politicians defied the ban on new
                    political parties and announced the formation of the Democratic Progressive
                    Party (DPP). KMT conservatives urged Chiang to arrest them, but he told the
                    conservatives that times were changing and this had to be accepted. So, that was
                    the big signal that political reform was coming. Ching-kuo terminated martial
                    law the following year and Taipei passed a civic organization's law that
                    legalized new political parties. They also ended the ban on new newspapers,
                    which had been used as a control mechanism of the press, opening up a much freer
                    press environment. The process went on to a number of other steps, but led to in
                    2000, 14 years later, to a peaceful transfer of government from the KMT to a
                    president representing the opposition DPP.</p>

                        been Taiwanese watchers in the mainland government at the embassy here. I
                        was wondering whether you were picking up from your colleagues who were
                        working with that embassy how they were viewing things in Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They were trying to figure out what this political transition meant. Did
                    having a Taiwanese president mean that Beijing was going to face demands for
                    Taiwan independence? How do you interpret the freer expression of opinion and
                    the fact that Taiwanese were now free to advocate independence? What did this
                    mean? Yes, there was a lot of interest.The Chinese Embassy was talking to
                    various people around Washington, including those on the China desk.
                    Occasionally either people from AIT in Washington or we on the Taiwan
                    Coordination Staff would meet with Chinese diplomats. We didn't want to do it
                    too often because our job was to deal with Taiwan, and Taipei was very sensitive
                    about our contacts with the PRC. Nevertheless we did meet to make sure that the
                    channels of communication were open and that the PRC accurately understood the
                    way we saw what was happening.</p>
                <p>

                        towards everything or was this, did you see that probably the KMT would
                        eventually be if not phased out, be having to compete for jobs and things
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, we foresaw that. However, it appeared that the KMT position remained
                    strong. There was a debate among analysts about whether the KMT was going to be
                    in effect another version of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, a permanent
                    government party within a democratic system because the opposition could not get
                    itself organized effectively to compete with it. The democratic transition had
                    gone far enough by the time I left in '89 that that kind of debate was taking
                    place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were dealing with Taiwan, were we ever called

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: This was not the period of military confrontation in the Strait. I mean we
                    had issues that we had to deal with because the Taiwan military and the PRC
                    military were occasionally coming into close proximity of each other in the
                    strait. In the mid 80s, the Taiwan military was still quite confident. They had
                    higher quality systems and they would sometimes try to fly too close to the
                    mainland and provoke the PRC. At times we had to warn Taiwan from doing that
                    sort of thing.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Very little. I mean there was some talk, in the context of Taipei's
                    decision to open up travel to the mainland, about what role the offshore islands
                    might play? Can something take place in terms of travel back and forth there?
                    Intriguing questions, but in 1987 when travel to the mainland had just begun, it
                    was too early for such a major change on the offshore islands.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Yes, I had observed the drama of Tiananmen while still in Washington. The
                    students in the square, the mass demonstrations of a kind that had never been
                    seen before in Communist China, many ordinary citizens joining in, delegations
                    from different ministries participating in the demonstrations. For a while, I
                    believed this would lead to some very significant change. Then martial law was
                    declared and the military suppressed the demonstrations.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>In Taiwan, there was a lot of optimism that spring that real reform might occur
                    in China. Then of course, when the crack down came, this bubble burst and the
                    usual attacks on the communists resumed.What happened to cross-strait travel,
                    trade and investment during this period is very interesting. Businessmen went to
                    the mainland, business continued, investments continued, it was rather
                    remarkable. After Tiananmen, when most of the world was reducing contacts and
                    there was reluctance by many in the West to invest in China, to everyone's
                    surprise Taiwanese investments just kept going pretty much as though nothing had
                    happened. It was motivated by business opportunities and most of the investments
                    were in the southern coastal part of China, which was not heavily affected by
                    what was going on in Beijing.</p>
                <p>Was Taiwan intelligence involved in trying to support the democracy movement in
                    China during that April May period? We didn't have very much information on that
                    at that time. Most of the external support from overseas Chinese seemed to be
                    coming out of Hong Kong rather than Taipei. But how much came from Taiwan wasn't
                    clear at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. You have to remember that this started slowly. There had been a
                    certain amount of unacknowledged trade going on indirectly before the travel ban
                    was lifted in '87. The volume was still modest and not in the high tech area. It
                    was textiles and shoes and sportswear and products like that. Today if you look
                    at the cross-strait trade it's a very different picture. It's a huge factor both
                    for China and for Taiwan. It is very much tied into global IT trade.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Taiwanese versus mainland diplomacy in Africa
                        and other places? Was this at all sort of a battlefield while you were

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The diplomatic struggle was a constant phenomenon. I can't remember who
                    lost and who won what in that particular period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, when you left there after Tienanmen, where did
                        you go in '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>BROWN: Before we leave, let me just come back to one other issue that was very
                    important in those days and about which there have been reports subsequently in
                    the public record. That is the question of non-proliferation in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about non-proliferation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well about the Taiwan effort to acquire nuclear weapons, which we talked
                    about earlier when we discussed the period when I was on the desk in the '70s.We
                    went through another bout of this. It was reported at the time that Taiwan
                    formally shut down and disabled its research reactor in 1988. This was the
                    reactor they had purchased from Canada in the 1960s. The other information in
                    the public media was the defection to the United States in early 1988 of one of
                    the deputy directors of the Taiwan Atomic Energy Commission. The circumstances
                    were never very clear in the media under which this individual ended up in the
                    United States, but the fact that he was here was reported at the time and it is
                    in the public record now. Dealing with this issue was one of the most important
                    things the U.S. did in this period. It was in a way cleaning up after our own
                    mess. I say that because the impetus for getting back to an interest in nuclear
                    weapons by the Taiwan military came after we switched relations and their sense
                    of insecurity became very real. Things developed to the point that we had to
                    discretely tell Taiwan that this reactor had to be shut down and disabled. That
                    reactor was the core of the problem because it could be used in a weapons
                    program. In the '70s we had agreed Taiwan could continue to operate it under
                    IAEA safeguards and it just became apparent that that wasn't the smart
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did the Taiwanese react?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, there were only a very small number of people in Taiwan who were
                    aware that this was an issue. They essentially were persuaded that their
                    relations with the United States, with the Reagan and Bush administrations, were
                    more important to their security than anything they might be thinking of doing
                    in terms of developing a weapons capability of their own. The people who were
                    involved in it saw that the better part of wisdom would be to shut down this
                    reactor. This took place around the time that Chiang Ching-kuo passed away.The
                    only thing known to the public was that the deputy director of the Atomic Energy
                    Commission and his family had disappear from Taiwan and it was rumored gone to
                    the United States. We were fortunate enough not to have congressional hearings
                    on this, thanks to some careful briefings of key members, so there was no sort
                    of public discussion of it in the United States either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this director and family left, what was behind

                <p>BROWN: Well, I think I better leave it at that because I don't want to go beyond
                    what is in the public record. I think you could put the pieces together you
                    could assume that something he told us was significant in terms of our
                    understanding of what was going on.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We used to have trouble. I know when I was in Saigon it
                        was something known as China coasters. These were sailors who spent all
                        their time; they wouldn't leave ships anywhere. I mean they just kept going
                        up and down the China coast with literally a wife in every port. You were
                        almost a China coaster then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well that's an interesting way to put it. I wonder what my wife would say
                    about that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Hong Kong from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: '89 to '92.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting time.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was the Deputy Consul General.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was consul general then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: At the beginning, it was Don Anderson and in the second two years it was
                    Richard Williams.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Williams. Dick Williams. You really ought to interview him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He's retired in California now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we might be able to do something. I've interviewed
                        Anderson I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Dick Williams has one of the best memories of anyone I have ever met. He
                    can recall everything. So, he'd be great person to interview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Hong Kong '89. You know Tiananmen had happened. The
                        takeover was not that far away. What was the operative date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: 1997.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was a date that was well, everybody had it on their
                        mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right. There were a lot of important negotiations going on between the
                    British and the Chinese during this period. The most important being drafting
                    what is called the Basic Law, which was the mini constitution that set the
                    framework of how Hong Kong would run after its reversion to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there the aftermath of Tiananmen must
                        have been... Things had been almost euphoric before. You weren't in Hong
                        Kong, but coming there, this was a dose of communist reality, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right and the city was very nervous. You saw this in a variety of ways.
                    You saw it in the growth of the Democratic Party in Hong Kong, which was just
                    getting started. It was very much motivated by people who were determined to do
                    as much as they could to protect Western values, civic society and promote
                    democracy in Hong Kong, move it along as far as you can get it before the
                    turnover, to provide some kind of a base of democratic politics in Hong Kong
                    before the handover took place. You saw it in our own staff at the consulate,
                    which was very nervous.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the Chinese staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, Chinese at the consulate. After reversion in 1997, if they were still
                    working for the consulate, would they be considered as spies because of what
                    they had done at the consulate? How were they going to be protected? You saw it
                    in many different manifestations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a way well, I don't want to put words in your
                        mouth. I mean what were we, the Hong Kong and the premiere observing spot of
                        China, but now we have an embassy, we have the consulate generals. What was
                        Hong Kong doing at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, we still had a mainland reporting unit as part of a combined
                    political economic section. There were four people from the State Department
                    component reporting on China. We had a large defense attach� office, though it
                    didn't have that title. Their focus was on the PLA in China and what could be
                    learned about it both from sources in Hong Kong and by traveling around China in
                    the guise of being tourists. Once in a while they got in a bit of trouble from
                    what they were doing, but nothing egregious. Then there was a CIA station there,
                    which was very heavily focused on what could be learned from Hong Kong about the
                    mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously were we at the time when we were looking at what
                        the British were up to and you know, and also we're beginning to lay plans
                        for what are we doing about Hong Kong? We might not be a player, but had our
                        staff and everything else. What were we thinking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In early '92, which was five years before the transition was to take
                    place, at Washington's request, Beijing and Hong Kong did a joint study of what
                    should the U.S. presence in Hong Kong be after reversion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is our post in Beijing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, our post, Embassy Beijing. Stape Roy, the ambassador at the time and
                    Dick Williams, the CG, were the ones who oversaw the collective inputs as to
                    what the nature of the relationship should be. Our recommendations were then
                    sent to Washington. No decisions were made at that time, our recommendations
                    were later largely followed when reversion occurred. Interestingly enough, there
                    was no big difference of opinion between the Embassy and Consulate. It was
                    agreed that the United States would have an interest in supporting the “high
                    degree of autonomy” that Hong Kong was supposed to get and that therefore, the
                    type of organization the U.S. should have in Hong Kong should be consistent with
                    the concept of Hong Kong having a high degree of autonomy, i.e., it shouldn't be
                    just another consulate in China. But a Consulate with more autonomy from the
                    Embassy than is usual. Embassy Beijing agreed even then that the person who was
                    in Hong Kong should be seen within the State Department as a chief of
                    missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words certainly we report directly to
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, On all things that had to do with Hong Kong's autonomy, and
                    simultaneously have a close liaison relationship with Beijing, but not be
                    treated by Beijing in the same way that Shanghai, Guangzhou and the other
                    consulates were treated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this of course to somebody who isn't familiar with
                        this extremely important because you could have a chief of mission in
                        Beijing who would want to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Exert control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exert control and all of a sudden a lot of disquieting
                        reports came out of Hong Kong it would be tempting to sit on those or to do
                        this. This way by just this reporting channel meant that you would be
                        getting a certain analysis that did not have to go through the venting of
                        the embassy. I mean this happens. We always have this problem if you have
                        supervision. I mean that close supervision. So, it was really a very
                        important decision.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. Right. When they made the decision at the time of reversion, that's
                    the way it came out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what were the things you were particularly
                        concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, one was to do everything we could to try and make sure that when the
                    transition took place there was a basis for continuing to treat Hong Kong as an
                    autonomous unit in terms of U.S. policy. There we had the cooperation of the
                    Congress and particularly Congressman Porter who was on the House Human Rights
                    Caucus and Senator McConnell.</p>
                <p>McConnell and Porter took the lead in passing the Hong Kong Policy Act which
                    essentially said the United States has a strong interest in Hong Kong's
                    continuing autonomy under the Basic Law arrangements worked out with China. It
                    will be U.S. policy to support that high degree of autonomy at the time. We will
                    continue to deal with Hong Kong separately on things like immigration and
                    customs and IPR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IPR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Intellectual property rights and export controls, textile agreements, all
                    of these kinds of things would remain in place. Rather than reaching a
                    pessimistic assumption about what would happen after reversion, this legislation
                    said the opposite. We're going to treat Hong Kong separately so long as its has
                    real autonomy. That was very important. In the process of doing that we also
                    dealt with our employees' concerns in the sense of getting special provisions
                    put into legislation. If at the time of transition any employees in the
                    consulate wanted to, we would work out expeditious naturalization for them to
                    get a visa on the basis of their employment at the consulate without waiting for
                    the normal 30 years. It was a special set of provisions so that any member of
                    the consulate who felt threatened could get a visa and go to the United States
                    as an immigrant. In the end, very few people in the end took advantage of that
                    provision, but the option was very import to our employees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about were we getting good information from the
                        British on how things were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The British were pretty good. There was a debate in Hong Kong at that time
                    as to whether the British were really looking after the interests of Hong Kong
                    or whether they were simply being narrow mindedly British and only caring about
                    British commercial interests. I happened to be one of the people who thought the
                    British were doing a reasonably good job of looking after Hong Kong's interests.
                    Of course, that gets you into the whole question about how you view of Chris
                    Patten, the final British Governor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't there at your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>BROWN: He came just as I was leaving. David Wilson, a career British Foreign
                    Service officer as the governor when I was there, but just as I was leaving
                    Patten replaced him.He had a very different approach. Anyway, we in the
                    Consulate thought that the British were doing a pretty good job of ensuring that
                    the provisions of the Joint British- Chinese Declaration were accurately
                    translated into the new domestic Chinese legislation, the so-called Basic Law
                    for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The British were pushing the
                    Chinese to consult to a degree with the people of Hong Kong about what the
                    content of what that law should be. The Chinese organized a basic law drafting
                    committee, which had mainly mainland Chinese on it, but included a number of
                    people from Hong Kong. These Hong Kong representatives were chosen by the
                    Chinese, not by the Hong Kong people or by the British. There was an effort to
                    pressure those Hong Kong representatives to stand up for Hong Kong and to have
                    an open process where the texts of draft law were known not just to the British
                    but also to the Hong Kong people and were debated in public. The British played
                    a role in setting up that process.Some people it as only a sham consultation
                    process because the Chinese appointed the members and others thought that this
                    limited process was better than not having any role at all for Hong Kong. I was
                    in that latter camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking at that time did we want was Hong Kong as
                        sort of an economic dynamo important to us? In other words, were we
                        interested say beyond the fate of the people in Hong Kong, but just to have
                        that, was that a good thing for us to have that there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, definitely. It was not a perfect free market economy by any stretch of
                    the imagination</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, under the British. Hong Kong gets a lot better marks for being a free
                    market economy than it deserves. It gets those marks because in terms of the
                    trade in goods it's a very open economy. In the services area, however, it was
                    very carefully controlled by the British.Our problems in the trade sector with
                    Hong Kong were largely in the services area. What could lawyers do? Doctors,
                    people who were involved in various parts of the financial sector, what could
                    they do and what couldn't they do? How do you regulate telephone services? How
                    do you open up the port operations to other country's firms? Who would get the
                    services contracts at the new airport that they're building? The Hong Kong
                    economy was very important to the United States because there was s a lot of
                    American investment there, a lot of American companies there, but more
                    importantly it was because of the impact that that economy was having on South
                    China. There was a very symbiotic relationship between Hong Kong and the parts
                    of China that were reforming economically the fastest and so the ability of Hong
                    Kong to promote economic reform in China was seen as a big plus. It was
                    something that you would want to keep going. Reform has gone so far in the 21st
                    Century that Hong Kong's impact on China is less than it was at that time, but
                    roughly 70% of all foreign direct investments into China in the years that I was
                    in Hong Kong came in through Hong Kong. That meant technology, the foreign
                    know-how, the ideas were coming in through Hong Kong, and keeping that going was
                    important. For me seeing democracy develop in Hong Kong as far as it could
                    possibly go was an important thing as well, not just for the sake of the people
                    in Hong Kong, but because of the demonstration effect on the rest of China.
                    Democracy hadn't gone nearly as far as one would like it to have gone. So it's
                    not having as much of a demonstration effect as one would hope, but Hong Kong is
                    still the only city in China where there are any members of a municipal council
                    who are directly elected by the citizens. The democratic process there is flawed
                    in many ways, but it's way ahead of the democratic process for the people of
                    Beijing or Guangzhou or Shenyang.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you aware or anybody else aware of mainland Chinese
                        officials coming in and looking over the property, slamming the car doors,

                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, China was becoming a bigger part of the Hong Kong economy while we
                    were there. There was a process of adjustment by the old British firms in which
                    they realized that they didn't have to keep their relations with London and the
                    governor greased as much as they had to keep their relations with Beijing and
                    the incoming Chinese economic entities greased. You saw companies bringing in
                    Chinese investors. You saw Cathay Pacific, the British invested airline in Hong
                    Kong, spinning off a joint venture airline with some Chinese counterparts called
                    DragonAir that would handle a large amount of the flights between, not all of
                    them, but a large percentage of the flights between Hong Kong and the mainland.
                    Cathay Pacific was an investor in DragonAir along with the Chinese. So, you saw
                    this kind of positioning going on. Not by American companies because the
                    American companies didn't have the inside track with the British. It was mainly
                    the old-line British firms trying to adjust to the new masters. Some British
                    firms tried to avoid this.Jardines, one of the oldest firms, moved their
                    headquarters offshore so that it wouldn't be subject to control in Hong Kong.
                    Its total business was in Hong Kong, but the headquarters would be in the Cayman
                    Islands, I recall. However, most of the British firms m went the other way
                    finding ways to get along with your new masters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were American firms still coming into Hong Kong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, yes, very much so. The American chamber there was one of the biggest
                    in the world and it was growing in those years despite Tiananmen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a matter that it was a comfortable place in a way

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes and lots of local Hong Kong businessmen were doing the same thing. So
                    American firms could operate on their own or cooperate with local partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we relate to our consulate general in
                        Guangzhou?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They were two separate organizations with distinct purposes, but
                    overlapping interests because of Hong Kong's intense economic ties with south
                    China.</p>

                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>BROWN: There was some bumping in not just with Guangzhou, but also with all the
                    China post because of Hong Kong's reporting responsibilities on China.Hong Kong
                    provided unique perspectives on China that didn't always jibe with views from
                    within China. And our defense attaches ere given responsibilities to travel
                    throughout China. I remember a good friend who was the naval attach� took a trip
                    to Tibet and then out from Tibet to Nepal and down to India.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No, not at all. We had I would say quite a bit of contact both with the
                    representatives of China in Hong Kong and with the Chinese business there. It
                    wasn't intimate, but a fair amount of contact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflections there from Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We had a big problem with Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong. We were caught
                    between Washington then under the first Bush administration, which did not want
                    to force any Vietnamese back to Vietnam and the UNHCR and the Hong Kong
                    government that wanted to carefully distinguish between economic migrants and
                    political refugees and send back to Vietnam those who were economic migrants.
                    For Hong Kong, returning migrants was to be a deterrent against a continuing
                    flood of people into Hong Kong. The numbers were quite large. It was a huge
                    political issue within Hong Kong. All the money that had to go into building
                    camps and providing police and health services and education in the camps and
                    all this cost the Hong Kong taxpayer a lot. So there was pressure on the
                    government to get the Vietnamese out.The Chinese Government frequently reminded
                    Hong Kong that this problem should not exist in 1997. Clean it up; get rid of
                    these people. was Beijing's message. And Washington was saying in effect don't
                    send anyone back to Vietnam. Washington wanted liberal criteria for determining
                    political refugee status. Anybody with the slightest reason for political
                    refugee status should be given every opportunity to prove his or her case in
                    Hong Kong.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, quite a few people were coming to the States.By the end of the time I
                    was there, we'd interviewed extensively and taken everybody that we wanted to
                    take.There were criminal elements among the remaining Vietnamese. People who
                    either had a criminal record that you could identify back in Vietnam or who had
                    committed crimes in the camps. So how to evaluate the remaining Vietnamese was a
                    very controversial issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues there, a lot of fleet visits
                        and things like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. And the fleet visits were one aspect of our efforts to build a
                    foundation for post-reversion relationships. We wanted to make sure that we had
                    all of this working smoothly and in a way which had a chance of surviving
                    because the use of Hong Kong as an R&amp;R destination was very convenient for
                    the navy. We didn't want to do anything that would jeopardize that. The basic
                    law was very specific that defense matters were a central government
                    responsibility.Ship visits by naval vessels were an issue to be decided in
                    Beijing and not in Hong Kong. Most of the period since the handover we've been
                    able to have our ships visit Hong Kong as we did before, but there have been a
                    couple of times for instance after the Belgrade bombing and after the EP3
                    incident when the Chinese temporarily stopped giving approval. It's worked
                    reasonably well. What we were trying to do was position ourselves. We had an
                    office within the consulate that provided support for ship visits. They had some
                    facilities around town and we were trying to get these relocated in commercial
                    locations so that we could have a very small number of people in Hong Kong
                    handling visits, but the support structure would be there.</p>
                <p>We did some other things. We reorganized the USIS library operation that
                    conceivably could be seen as propaganda by a communist China. Partly for those
                    reasons and partly for budgetary reasons we relocated the USIS library to
                    Chinese University and made it a cooperative undertaking between Chinese
                    University and the consulate so it could be embedded in Hong Kong. We
                    renegotiated our air agreement with Hong Kong so it would be an agreement not
                    between Britain and the United States, but between Hong Kong and the United
                    States. The same thing was done in the area of law enforcement. We were
                    negotiating agreements with Hong Kong on legal assistance and extradition. We
                    got it negotiated but didn't actually get approval by the Senate until much
                    later. Our objective was to have a basis for continuing law enforcement
                    cooperation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was quite optimistic. Optimistic because we saw a lot of resilience in
                    the Hong Kong community. The British were beginning to allow Hong Kong Chinese
                    to have significant positions in the administration, five or six years in
                    advance so that they would be positioned there to keep the civil administration
                    going. We didn't know how the political arrangements were going to work out, but
                    the arrangements were very explicit on one thing and that was that there weren't
                    going to be people from Beijing running things. It was going to be people in
                    Hong Kong, ultimately chosen by Beijing, but people in Hong Kong. And I thought
                    they would stand up or be pushed by the Hong Kong people to stand up for Hong
                    Kong.</p>
                <p>Why would one be optimistic? One reason was the resilience of the Hong Kong
                    community. The second was that the international community would be watching.
                    The international community has I think a number of guises, but one of the most
                    important is what you would call international markets. Hong Kong was important
                    to the Chinese economy because of the investment flow, and the Chinese would
                    have its self interest in making sure that Hong Kong remained a vibrant economy
                    and an entry way for the benefits of international trade which were still
                    heavily coming through there. The third reason that gave one some confidence was
                    the Taiwan factor. Everyone knew that the mainland wanted to move on from
                    dealing with Hong Kong to dealing ultimately with Taiwan and talking it back
                    into the fold.If Taiwan concluded that Beijing had not implemented its deal with
                    Hong Kong, then no one in Taiwan would risk making a deal with Beijing.
                    Therefore, the PRC had an interest from that angle as well of living up to the
                    terms worked out with the British in order to have credibility in trying to deal
                    with Taiwan. So, there were reasons for Beijing to adhere to its agreement to
                    give Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. It wasn't a lost cause, and the U.S.
                    should do its part in encouraging the deal to work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? I must say I was sort of surprised,
                        because I had never followed Hong Kong at all, to see that the British were
                        opening Hong Kong up to more Hong Kongese into the government and all that.
                        I would have thought that that would have been done a long time ago. Was
                        there a feeling that the Brits really should have done this a long time
                        ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Definitely. They should have done it years earlier. They should have had a
                    political process going on in Hong Kong in the '70s and '80s, but they made some
                    decisions early after the Second World War and repeated them I think in the '60s
                    at the time of the cultural revolution of China, that by gosh Britain was going
                    to keep control of things. Yes, there was a legislative council for the city as
                    a whole, but until 1984, the year of the Sino-British joint Declaration, every
                    single member of the legislative council was appointed by the governor. It was a
                    selection process, not an election process. The British began rapidly after '84
                    moving to put in place representative institutions. What was the Chinese view of
                    this? The Chinese view was that Hong Kong was to be turned over the way I had
                    been in 1984. So introducing representative government after 1984 wasn't
                    something Beijing had agreed to.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had a point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They had a point. Beyond the Legislative Council, there were a large
                    number of Hong Kong people working in the administration, but very few of them
                    made it up to the senior levels.There were large numbers of Brits not just as
                    the head of departments, but as the head of sections of departments and deputy
                    section heads who were still British civil servants running Hong Kong up until
                    the late '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems so almost atypical of what was happening
                        everywhere else, I mean you know, one always hears about the Belgian Congo
                        was the great thing. They had about three educated people and here you're
                        talking about a highly sophisticated city. I mean were you talking to the,
                        was there sort of a colonial attitude among the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. There was an end the empire mentality among some of them. The
                    official government view, the British government view was that we've got a
                    pretty good deal and its' going to work and we're gong to be proud of what we're
                    doing, we're not ratting out and abandoning these people. But there were a lot
                    of civil servants who sort of said, oh, you guys will never be able to run it.
                    Moral will collapse and corruption will return. That was the end of empire
                    mentality among some of the British civil servants. They were the Brits who left
                    at reversion. Yet today, there are still many Brits working in second rung
                    positions in Hong Kong government, even now six or seven years after Hong Kong's
                    return.</p>

                <p>BROWN: I came back in the summer of '92 to the Office of Indonesia, Malaysia,
                    Brunei and Singapore. This was a job for which I had had no training. I had not
                    served in any of those countries previously and essentially got this job because
                    a friend of mine was Principal DAS.</p>

                    he retains an interest in Vietnam. His last job was as head of our office in

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, what were the issues in '92? You were there a

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues that you found yourself dealing with
                        in this unknown part of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The first thing was finding out what ASEAN was all about. Actually I
                    became quite taken with this organization for what it was accomplishing in
                    Southeast Asia. I became fascinated with their efforts to get a dialogue on
                    security issues going in the Asian region. The dialogue would have people who
                    had been at war with each other in the past talking together about what the
                    region should look like in the future. The Bush administration had been against
                    such dialogues in the past because they saw these activities as potentially
                    undermining our alliance relationships, which were the basis of American
                    security in the Pacific. When I got back to Washington, Bill Clark was the
                    Assistant Secretary at the end of the Bush administration. Bill was open minded
                    about these things so we got to talking and concluded that the time had come for
                    the U.S. to shift gears and participate in discussion of security issues in a
                    multilateral context in Asia. Well, this didn't go anywhere because Bill was
                    serving at the end of an administration when new initiatives had to await the
                    outcome of the election. .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are you talking about for the United States? What had
                        been our stand before in this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Our stand had been that we didn't want to see multilateral dialogues on
                    securities developing because we were afraid they would undermine U.S. security
                    policy. In the late '80s Gorbachev was still in control of the Soviet Union and
                    was trying to promote these kinds of dialogues and was very explicitly in saying
                    that they were intended to replace alliances, meaning ours. So the
                    administration had been warning others not to be taken in by such suggestions.
                    Well, that era had ended before I got back to Washington because in December of
                    '91 the Soviet Union had disappeared. So people were willing to take a new look
                    at this in part because two of the strongest supporters of such dialogues were
                    our allies Japan and Australia. So, it seemed to us that we could take a new at
                    this and like I said that didn't go anywhere under Bill Clark.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>When Clinton got elected he nominated Winston Lord to be his assistant Secretary
                    for Asia. In his confirmation hearings, Winston stated that he was open to
                    pursuing security dialogues. The climate was ripe for this throughout the rest
                    of Asia.So when the new administration signaled its willingness, people in ASEAN
                    picked that up.In the spring of 1993, even before Winston was really sworn in,
                    the Singaporeans had already proposed a meeting of like-minded countries in
                    Singapore for April or May to see if agreement could be reached on launching a
                    regional security dialogue. So, Winston and I and Bill Pendley from the Defense
                    Department, ISA Office for Asia, and a couple of others went to participate in
                    this meeting.Out of the meeting came a consensus proposal to set up something
                    called the ASEAN Regional Forum, which would be an inconclusive group of
                    countries talking about security in Asia. Inclusive meant that this would be not
                    just the U.S. and its allies, but that the Russians, the Chinese, the
                    Vietnamese, the Lao would be invited to participate so that it really would be
                    an inclusive group. Then everyone went home to consult with their governments to
                    see whether policy makers would endorse an idea that had been worked out at the
                    senior officials level. Low and behold, no one in Washington objected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, as long as the marshal plan in a way, how it sort of
                        got going. Sort of a suggestion is thrown out and everybody says, hey, let's
                        talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. The talk had been going on for some time, and the Singaporeans who,
                    who always think strategically, were in the Chair of ASEAN and in a position to
                    take the initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is Lee Kwan Yew still the prime minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He had retired as prime minister, but designed for himself the “senior
                    minister” and appointed a man of the next generation. Goh Chok Tong, to be the
                    prime minister.But everybody knew who was calling the shots. So, Singapore
                    launched this initiative, it was pretty clear that he would have the blessing of
                    Lee to do this, and it very much fits into Lee's way of thinking strategically
                    about the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find when this working a strategic
                        alliance you said was down within the East Asian Bureau? Was this one of
                        these things that felt that its time has come or were there problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>BROWN: We had no problems. But I'll be frank about it, that was because almost
                    nobody cared at all? Winston and Bill Pendley at Defense thought this was a good
                    idea. I happened to entirely agree. As I said we could have been moving in this
                    direction before they arrived.So we wrote the briefing papers to the Secretary,
                    cleared them around, DOD, NSC and CIA, before sending it up the line. There was
                    very little debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pushing against an unlocked door?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right. It came back saying, okay, go ahead and do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did this mean for us? How did you see this?
                        What did this mean we were doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: First, we weren't undoing anything that the U.S. had in place. We were
                    preserving our alliance relationships. We were cooperating as I said with other
                    allied governments in the region who thought this was the right thing to do. So,
                    we saw this as adding something else on top of what we already had, our
                    alliances, adding something that was compatible with those alliance
                    relationships. We thought over time dialogue might help reshape the way
                    countries in Asia had dealt with each other.We were conscious that there were
                    long term historical animosities at work, the Chinese and Vietnamese, the
                    Chinese and Japanese, and that there were short-term issues that divided
                    countries. The Vietnamese had at that point in time just gotten out of Cambodia.
                    While this issue was being debated, the North Korean nuclear issue was blowing
                    up in the northern part of Asia. So, there were lots of contemporary issues. We
                    believed that the U.S. had nothing to lose and potentially something to gain
                    over the long term by getting people together and seeing if they couldn't build
                    “habits of cooperation” as we put it then. To talk about security issues, to
                    understand each other's concerns and fears and build habits of cooperation where
                    they had not existed before.</p>
                <p>When you had looked at the military organizations of most of the countries in
                    Asia, you saw they were very closed inward looking organizations. Part of what
                    we were aiming for was to find ways of breaking those barriers down and building
                    linkages and establishing relationships. This was a bit of a trick because, even
                    though the U.S. brought along DOD colleagues, almost no other country that
                    showed up at the initial planning meeting brought anyone from their militaries
                    along. Once the thing had been established, one of the early U.S. goals was to
                    get the military officers, particularly younger military officers, engaged in
                    the work of this organization, working on things that were common problems, that
                    were not controversial, but would begin to establish some personal
                    relationships. Believe it or not even within ASEAN, which had created a huge
                    pattern of cooperation amongst almost every part of their governments, there was
                    little direct contact between military officials.</p>

                        military was sort of a self imposed until dealing within a country rather
                        than?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Right and in some of these countries there wasn't a lot of communication
                    between the military and other segments of civil society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think one of the things that you'd think up there
                        would be to work on piracy, the naval.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, that was in fact an area that everyone was talking about as something
                    that the ARF might get involved in once it got started. It's gone about it in a
                    very delicate way because the question of piracy is very politically
                    sensitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It is politically sensitive along the China coast because it implies that
                    China is not able to control its own maritime borders and politically sensitive
                    in Southeast Asia particularly in Indonesia for the same reason. So in the
                    Malacca Straits, are you going to allow well-organized Singaporean police to
                    chase pirates into Indonesian and Malaysian waters? So, piracy was too sensitive
                    an issue for a fledgling organization to deal with at the start. In fact,
                    arrangements were worked out on a trilateral basis between the Indonesia,
                    Malaysia and Singapore on how to improve policing in the Malacca Straits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think all of these countries though of us as the camel
                        that was sticking its head under the tent, into the tent or something. I
                        mean we travel with our military. I mean they're part of our calculation and
                        have them say let's all get together and they'll take one look at the
                        seventh fleet or something like this, you can see an awful lot. I would
                        think it would be very reluctant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, it took a while. Let's put it that way. It took six or seven years
                    before the pattern of everybody bringing defense officials, whether they were
                    civilians or in uniform, along got established. But here I'm looking into the
                    future and not talking abou'93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>BROWN: In 1992 and 1993 when I was in the IMBS Office, I dealt with this issue
                    because that office handled our policy toward ASEAN as an organization. That's
                    how I got involved with ASEAN, and it was also the reason I got out of that
                    office. With a new regional security organization being formed, we decided that
                    the East Asia Bureau had to reorganize and get ready to deal more meaningful
                    with these kind of regional security issues.EAP had an office of regional
                    affairs, but it was an office that dealt with anything that no other office
                    wanted to deal with. It handled congressional relations for the bureau, it
                    handled the preparations for our participation in the UN General Assembly and it
                    handled general budgeting issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It loses focus then on the security issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: So, what we did was we take the ASEAN portfolio out of the IMBS desk and
                    moved it into the regional affairs office and then renamed that office as the
                    Office of Regional and Security Policy. Within RSP, we set up a two person
                    operation that dealt just with the ARF. Since I knew little about the four IMBS
                    countries, I decided to switch jobs and go to this new RSP office to do
                    something that I felt I was developing some expertise in. It just so happened
                    that the officer who was slated to go into that job, a friend of mine, had spent
                    a good part of his career in Indonesia and Malaysia. So, I called him up and we
                    talked about it and he agreed he'd really rather be IMBS director.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Scott Butcher and I thought the regional thing was something that I could
                    contribute on and was interested in so we agreed to propose the switch and
                    talked to Winston Lord who approved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, at this time in '92 ASEAN was a pretty good regional
                        economic entity was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, it was six countries and they were all doing extremely well
                    economically. They had in this same period '91, '92, '93, been working very
                    successfully on the Cambodian peace agreement. The peace agreement wasn't
                    something that ASEAN did on its own. It was a combination of ASEAN and the
                    members of the P5 at the UN, the U.S., France, China, Russia, all playing
                    important roles. They put this altogether and got the UN to come in on a major
                    new peace keeping operation in Cambodia. So, because of its economic success and
                    its diplomatic contribution, ASEAN was quite highly regarded in that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your background was economic.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>BROWN: And political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And political, but I mean were you picking up any concern
                        about that whole Asian area and the finances you know because we're talking
                        about before the Asian financial crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: And the answer is no. We were not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had we sort of accepted the fact that banks were making
                        not very good loans and all that and that was just a way of life or
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The area was booming in the early 90s and I guess we and almost everyone
                    were asleep at the switch. This all hit in the summer of '97 and I had retired
                    in '96 a year before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It didn't happen on your watch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It didn't happen on my watch, but I was Director of Korean Affairs for the
                    year before this. The fact that Korea was running a trade deficit was known, but
                    we certainly didn't see the collapse coming. I left the Korea desk before the
                    early signs of trouble were recognized. I really left before the clear signs
                    that something might be going wrong in Korea emerged, but in this whole period I
                    would say that my colleagues and I, no one was standing up and saying this is a
                    huge bubble about to burst, look at the way this is being financed. Look at the
                    corporate governance; no one was saying those things in the '92 to '96 period
                    when I was back in the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wonder, I mean, things of this nature, the collapse of
                        the Soviet Union. I mean God knows no country has had such a concentration
                        of intelligence efforts overt and covert put on it and yet when it went,
                        just went, without any premonition of this and this Asian financial bubble
                        was a major, we're still living with some of the consequence of it. Yet,
                        somehow or another we don't see these things. I guess we don't' even see
                        things within our own country either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Again, this is getting beyond my retirement, but after it all blew, there
                    were a couple of people in what you might call the financial world who were able
                    to go back and say we wrote pieces in '96 predicting that a problem was coming
                    in Thailand or in Korea, but their numbers were very few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to the. Did you get involved at all in
                        the countries per se Indonesia and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the answer was yes, while I was at IMBS.I could tack off some of
                    those bigger things that happened on my watch in Indonesia. One had to do with
                    East Timor. There had just been a massacre in the year before in Dili. The
                    Indonesian police shooting demonstrators, there was a lot of attention focused
                    on East Timor. Xanana Gusmao, who was the leader of the independence movement
                    there, was in fact arrested in the fall of '92 not long after I took up my
                    responsibilities. Then we had the kind of thing that comes in your relations
                    with Singapore every once in a while. The Michael Fay caning case. You may
                    remember this? Fay was an American who had spray painted a car in Singapore and
                    was tried in the Singapore courts and given a sentence of six lashes with a
                    bamboo cane. This was a form of punishment that was used in Singapore, but
                    created a huge uproar in the United States. It became a political issue
                    involving the White House, which all of a sudden became very critical of human
                    rights conditions in Singapore as a result of this case. A country that had gone
                    out of its way to facilitate the American military presence in Asia after we
                    were forced out of the Philippines, all of a sudden became a politically persona
                    non grata in the United States. The administration didn't want to have senior
                    Singaporean officials coming because this issue was hanging over everyone's head
                    and people right up to the president were saying very critical things about
                    human rights conditions in Singapore. This was something we just had to deal
                    with. Eventually he was caned and returned to the United States. He lived
                    through the thing and it sort of all went away. There was about a six month
                    period between his sentencing and the carrying out of his sentence in which
                    there was a hell of a lot of activity to try and persuade the Singaporeans not
                    to actually carry out the sentence. They were simply determined that this was a
                    standard part of Singapore legal system and had actually come to them from the
                    British and they were going to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But on this at a certain point did you just say, okay,
                        this is show business. I mean this is posturing and you just sort of okay,
                        go along or did you really feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We thought at the beginning there was some hope that a little bit of quiet
                    diplomacy would maybe lead the Singaporeans to find someway of dealing with this
                    problem such as expelling him from the country without actually caning. However,
                    once the case had gotten the publicity of the White House criticizing
                    Singapore's human rights record, their backs got up and there was no way they
                    weren't going to carry out their own legal system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also was a new administration coming in which all can
                        run amuck for a while until they settle down and are able to be
                        responsible.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>BROWN: Right. So, we had that and the other thing that was interesting was
                    concerned Malaysia where we had had very bad relations under Bush and Baker at
                    the end of the Bush presidency.Malaysia sent out some fairly clear signals that
                    Prime Minister Mahathir wanted to have better relations with the U.S. We worked
                    quite hard at bringing that about. Mahathir was a very complex individual whose
                    rhetoric was often critical of the United States, but who on a practical level,
                    both facilitated American investment in his country and also quietly kept a good
                    working relationship with the U.S. military. We saw the basis for being able to
                    cooperate with him on certain things while sort of looking the other way his
                    rhetoric, which he calmed down in this period. I think we made substantial
                    progress and the focus of it was in trying to persuade the Malaysians to buy
                    advanced military aircraft from the U.S. They were in the market for a modern
                    jet to strengthen their air force and were looking at French, Russian and
                    American planes. So, we made a huge push on it and in the end Mahathir decided
                    to split the business between the Russians and the Americans and bought some
                    MIGs and some F18s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say Mahathir was a complex person. What was, where was
                        his anti-American rhetoric coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think it was in part a reflection of his personality. He was at times an
                    abrasive, straight talking individual. He was also playing to his domestic
                    audiences in Malaysia that are predominantly Muslim and often critical of the
                    U.S. I can't remember just what the rhetoric was, but before I came on the job
                    Mahathir had gone to the UN and given a vitriolic speech attacking the American
                    role in the world.That was what really poisoned his relations with the Bush
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, I mean, you came in between, you came in
                        under the Bush administration? How did you find the transition from your
                        optic went from your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I think it went quite well. Again I'm just speaking of the East Asian
                    Bureau. Bill Clark a real professional passed things over to Winston Lord who
                    had worked in government for democrats and republicans at different times. I
                    think Lord had endeared himself to Clinton because he had taken a hard line on
                    China's human rights policy, advocating the linkage of trade and the human
                    rights. But he had worked in a republican administration before. And so, it was
                    one professional turning things over to another professional. It was a sharp
                    contrast with Dick Holbrook's arrival in the Carter years.Dick didn't want to
                    listen to a single thing, his predecessor Amb. Hummel had to say. Winston was
                    the exact opposite. He was willing to talk to everybody. He consulted endlessly
                    with people. So, there was a much easier transition. There wasn't a wholesale
                    scrapping of people. There were some changes. Winston brought in Peter Thompson
                    who had been his DCM in Beijing to be the principal DAS and made him responsible
                    for China. Peter was not a particular popular choice amongst his professional
                    colleagues, but he was a professional.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did in _____ and all, how about the China card, how were
                        things changing there or did you see that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN:The new administration, including Lord, came into office with the Clinton
                    campaign rhetoric criticizing the Chinese leaders a“the butchers of
                    Beijing.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the aftermath of Tiananmen
                        Square?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: That's right. Clinton had criticized the Bush administration for working
                    so hard to keep the U.S. China relationship going after Tiananmen. Because of
                    that, Clinton had advocated, partly I think at Winston Lord's urging, a linkage
                    of trade access to the U.S. markets on favorable terms to progress on human
                    rights. That became the administration policy. Winston was at one time
                    administering the trade-human rights linkage in bilateral relations with China
                    and at the same time, on the multilateral level, he was working to include the
                    Chinese in the ARF.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Indonesian government at the time, how did
                        we see that when you had that responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Autocratic, repressive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Suharto still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, Suharto was President. We had the problems I mentioned earlier in
                    terms of their harsh treatment of East Timor. We had recurrent problems on labor
                    issues because Jakarta was arresting labor leaders and this created problems for
                    American policy, which wanted to promote free trade unions overseas. Suharto was
                    very repressive with respect to the press in Indonesia. He did not permit any
                    meaningful political opposition. There were three parties in Indonesia and they
                    were all ones that had been organized with the blessing of the government. I
                    felt that Indonesia had a very fragile political system and that American
                    business needed to be very careful. To operate successfully in Suharto's
                    Indonesia, you had to work with people who were well connected, which meant
                    finding ways of getting money to them and cutting deals from which these people
                    would profit as joint venture partners. It was a corrupt system. At the same
                    time, if you got too deeply in bed with these people and Suharto fell, you were
                    going to be hurt. It was a very tricky environment for foreign investors.</p>

                        block on this, to talk to the Indonesian hands, were they seeing this as
                        saying this is sort of the end game playing out as sort of with Marcos in
                        the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN:Not at that time. In 1992, '93 Suharto was still very much in control. You
                    have to remember that in 1997 four or five months before he was forced out of
                    office he had manufactured his reelection for a sixth term. His whole system
                    remained supportive and then six months later he was gone.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape six, side one with David Brown. How were we
                        viewing the problem of potential dissolution of the Indonesian nation? I
                        mean you have Aceh up in Sumatra. The whole place is just a despairing
                        nation. Were we just sort of hoping to keep it together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: in 1992-3, we did not see signs of imminent dissolution. We were aware of
                    these problems and we were constantly being told by the Indonesians that they
                    had to have a tough policy because if they didn't have a tough policy it would
                    be hard to hold Indonesia together. We knew it was a potential issue, but there
                    was no evidence that the Indonesian government was losing its control in Papua
                    or Aceh or for that matter in East Timor in '92 and '93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was East Timor a focus of our attention at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was a chronic irritant in U.S. Indonesian relations because of the
                    heavy-handed military occupation of East Timor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a case where it was hard for us to talk to the
                        military in Indonesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. We had good access and dealings with the Indonesian military, though
                    our congress was doing its best to make this difficult, particularly after the
                    Dili massacre in November of 1991. The congress had started putting restrictions
                    on the use of IMET, the International Military Education and Training, funds for
                    the Indonesian military. We weren't selling the Indonesian military at this
                    point in time any substantial heavy equipment. First of all they didn't have
                    very much money to buy it and there was reluctance on the part of the U.S. to
                    sell them these systems. They were getting their equipment from other people. We
                    had some extraordinarily capable people in the defense attach� office, who had
                    been on multiple tours in Indonesia and had come up through the ranks with their
                    colleagues in the Indonesian armed forces.</p>

                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>BROWN: Absolutely. We were trying to do these things and having limited success I
                    would say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then when you moved over, this would be what
                        '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The summer of '93 I made the switch to this new office of Regional and
                    Security Policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '93 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: For two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '95.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, let's start on the bureaucratic thing,
                        when you get something renamed and all this it's usually a good bit of time
                        spent trying to develop your power to establish your footprint in the policy
                        thing, I mean, did you go through that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, there were a lot of things to be worked out beyond simply changing
                    the name.The key was to get two new positions for the regional security
                    function.That took a lot of took a lot of effort even when no one was opposing
                    it. I had the very strong support from Winston Lord the assistant secretary who
                    believed that the work he was doing on these multilateral arrangements in Asia,
                    the ARF which I was involved in and the addition to APEC of a leaders level
                    meeting were among his most important achievements. So, Winston was very
                    strongly supportive. It was just a matter of working these things all through
                    the hoops.</p>
                <p>Then the next two years was spent on the work of helping to establish the ARF.
                    Preparing for the first of its meetings in '94, which formally established the
                    organization. Then in between '94 and '95 a year was set aside by the ARF to
                    work out a consensus statement of what the organization was going to do in its
                    initial phase. That statement was endorsed by the foreign ministers in a meeting
                    in Brunei in the summer of 1995. That was basically the end of my tenure in
                    RSP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that Winston Lord worked with the
                        Secretary of State Warren Christopher?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>BROWN: Very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a matter of Warren Christopher saying you get East
                        Asia, take it or was the hand of Christopher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: His hand was light, but there were certain issues that the Secretary had
                    to be involved in. Winston's work with him on China was probably the best
                    example of that. The Secretary also had to be involved in endorsing what we were
                    doing with the ARF. Christopher went to the Foreign Ministers meeting in
                    Singapore in 1993.This was a meeting of the foreign ministers of ASEAN and their
                    so-called dialogue partners, the U.S., Japan, Canada, Korea, Australia, New
                    Zealand. It was that group that decided to set up the ARF and to announce that
                    the next meeting in '94 would include the foreign ministers of the other
                    countries as well, Russia, China, Vietnam and so forth.</p>
                <p>Christopher was also scheduled to attend the actual first meting of the ARF that
                    took place in Bangkok the following summer. However, at the very last minute
                    Christopher decided not to go because of a hastily arranged meeting at the White
                    House between Arafat and Rabin. Christopher decided that it was more important
                    to be at this Middle East peace summit than to go to Bangkok's inaugural meeting
                    of the ARF. To put it in a less attractive light, Christopher's public image
                    wasn't particularly good. He had the image of a cold fish. It didn't appear that
                    he was terribly centrally involved in important issues, and his public affairs
                    handlers said, he's got to be seen as involved in something that's important and
                    that's the Middle East peace process. Even if the president was doing all the
                    real work, he's got to be there in the photographs. So he's not going to
                    Bangkok.</p>
                <p>Then there was the issue of who would take Christopher's place in Bangkok. The
                    Secretary's initial inclination was to send Peter Tarnoff who was the Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs in theory the third ranking person in the State
                    Department. But Tarnoff had not been involved with Asia policy and was not seen
                    as a politically important figure by Asians. Winston had to race around and get
                    the Secretary to change his mind and send Strobe Talbot, the Deputy Secretary.
                    Strobe went. He had more rank and was just the right kind of person for the job,
                    an intellectual who thought strategically and understood the importance of the
                    event. He accepted the job with a certain amount of relish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seen as you were getting ready for this the
                        development of ties in each country and then to each country to the
                        organization of the political military side, particularly the military
                        side?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>BROWN: That wasn't occurring in this first meeting, but we felt it was important.
                    We sent instructions to all our embassies to go in and talk about the importance
                    of bringing their defense officials along.The argument was that you couldn't
                    have a meaningful security dialogue until the people responsible security were
                    involved. We had some success in getting people to come along. Another thing we
                    pushed in the '94 to '95 period when the organization was thinking about how to
                    develop itself was the idea of organizing meetings on issues of practical
                    interest to the participating countries. Choosing activities would naturally
                    involve the military.The first of these practical meetings was now the
                    participation of militaries from the various countries in UN peacekeeping
                    operations. We got a dozen countries to show up at this first meeting and they
                    sent either defense or uniformed military people to the meeting to talk very
                    practically about what kind of units do you send, how do you have to prepare
                    them before they go. What kind of military training, what kind of political
                    sensitivity training do you have to give units that are going to participate in
                    UN peacekeeping operations? What works, what doesn't work? It was a very
                    non-confrontational activity, but it got the militaries from a number of
                    countries talking to each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like a workshop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, it was and that's what we called it — a workshop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Vietnam, was that, they were in this, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: They were involved.The first ARF ministers meeting in Bangkok took place
                    in a hotel room and used the format that Bill Clinton had worked out for the
                    APEC leaders meeting the year before. That was that the meetings would be
                    informal and that each country would only send two peoplthe foreign minister and
                    one senior official to sit behind him. The ministers sat in a big hotel room in
                    Bangkok in comfortable easy chairs for two hours talking with each other.The
                    seating was arranged alphabetically in the English language. So the Vietnam
                    Foreign Minister sat next to Strobe Talbot as the U.S. representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there as you were looking at this thing, were we
                        seeing a problem with Vietnam or were we sort of really trying to get
                        Vietnam into the bosom of the family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, you have to realize that we had not moved towards normalization of
                    U.S. Vietnamese relations at that point. Normalization was another issue that
                    Winston worked on very hard and we made some progress. When this meeting was
                    taking place in the summer of '94 we had not normalized relations. We didn't
                    have diplomatic ties with Vietnam at that point. This was another way to build
                    some bridges and show good will and so forth.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In looking at this during your '93 to '95 period and even
                        earlier when you had been in your other job, how would you, I won't say rank
                        the countries, but were there countries within this that were pains in the
                        asses and other ones that were from our perspective sort of on the right
                        road or prima donnas or anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I would say that the basic dynamic of this group was between
                    countries that wanted to see the organization develop and become meaningful and
                    others which were very concerned that the organization not do anything
                    whatsoever that infringed on their national sovereignty. Foremost among the
                    defenders of sovereignty were Indonesia and Malaysia. The Chinese were the other
                    ones acting as a break. The ARF operated by consensus, which pretty much meant
                    that even one county could block agreement. That was the main question. The
                    other subtext was between the ASEAN countries and the non-ASEAM members. The ARF
                    was the ASEAN not Asian regional forum.The ASEAN countries were absolutely
                    determined that they were going to remain the “driving force” behind this
                    organization. They were not going to let the big boys, the Chinese, the Japanese
                    and the Americans, dictate to them what this organization should do.So this was
                    the other underlying dynamic. Our approach was to seek working arrangements
                    which allowed both the ASEAN and non-ASEAN members would have an equal ability
                    to contribute to the work of this organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem that you saw or you know, the United
                        States, the biggest boy on the block. We tend to be pro-active and all this
                        and then something like this I can see where diplomatically it would behoove
                        us to be sort of quiet and say, oh, this is great and not come in with all
                        sorts of proposals. I mean, but I can see it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: This is what we did. We went out of our way not to give the impression
                    that we were trying to run or dictate to this organization. We wanted very much
                    to have an impact on how it got started, how it defined its mission, what it
                    would do, but we didn't want to be seen as pushy and assertive. So our approach
                    was essentially to give everyone else credit for doing what we wanted done.
                    Whether that meant endorsing things that the Japanese wanted to do or supporting
                    the Australians who along with the Canadians were the two most activist
                    participants.We consulted closely, but let the activists make the proposals.
                    Then we would help them out and try to build consensus, while recognizing that
                    they were running much too fast for some of the others. I think in some ways our
                    biggest contribution at the beginning was this effort to find out ways of
                    quietly attracting the militaries into this organization.</p>

                <p>BROWN: India was not considered in the beginning.However, after I left and I
                    can't remember if this was '96 or '97, the issue of India joining was addressed.
                    While I wasn't directly involved then, basically the U.S. was reluctant to see
                    this happen because we were afraid that if you brought India in you would have
                    to bring Pakistan. If you brought Pakistan and India in, that would mean
                    importing the Indo-Pak controversy into the organization, which already had too
                    many internal problems to deal with. So, the U.S. resisted that, but once again
                    it was the Singaporeans who were pushing this and in the end the overall
                    consensus in the group was to one invite the Indians in and to reach an internal
                    consensus that there would never be an invitation to Pakistan. The reason many
                    countries wanted India in was to act as another counter weight to rising China.
                    One of the things on which there was a general consensus in the region was to
                    try and constrain China by embedding it in regional organizations. This was
                    never said but it was a subtext in all of this. Southeast Asians saw India as a
                    player in a larger game of trying to build a network that would constrain
                    China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, India makes a great deal of sense because of their
                        military power in the Indian Ocean and sort of like Japan on the other side,
                        that whole crescent there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: One other thing before we move on that was interesting was the Mischief
                    Reef incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Mischief Reef is the English name for a reef in the South China Sea, which
                    is within the 200-mile economic zone of the Philippines. It was an uninhabited
                    reef, claimed by the Philippines, by China and I think by Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This wasn't the Spratlys was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, yes I can remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In the spring of 1995, without any advance notice, the Chinese built what
                    they called a fishermen's assistance facility on Mischief Reef. From pictures,
                    it was a cement buildings built on pilings. The construction was done by the
                    Chinese military as part of China's effort to assert its rights in the South
                    China Sea. This really concerned the Philippines and provoked a general reaction
                    in Southeast Asia. This action led the U.S. Government to develop a new
                    statement of its policy on the South China Sea.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>It also became a major issue in the summer of 1995 in the preparations for the
                    ARF ministerial meeting in Brunei, a country with 250,000 people that was in the
                    chair of ASEAN. China with 1.2 billion people had just occupied a reef, maybe
                    400 miles from Brunei.It was Brunei's responsibility to coordinate the ARF's
                    response to the Chinese action. On one side of the issue you had countries that
                    were concerned saying we've got to put some pressure on the Chinese. On the
                    other side, China was opposed to putting the issue on the ARF agenda and at one
                    point threatened not to attend the meeting if Mischief Reef would be an issue
                    for discussion. The U.S. and Australia took the position that for the ARF to
                    have credibility as a security forum it would have to address the issue. This
                    was a very tricky issue and Brunei eventually having consulted widely went to
                    the Chinese and said, ministers are going to talk about this whether we put it
                    on the agenda or not. As the chairman, Brunei's foreign minister will have to
                    summarize the discussion that actually takes place in the written statement
                    issued at the end of the meeting. We want you to understand this.In the end, the
                    Chinese came the meeting. There was a discussion, and the Chinese presented a
                    new statement of their policy on the South China Sea in which for the first time
                    Beijing committed to resolving issues in accordance with the Law of the Sea
                    Treaty.Our interpretation was that the Chinese decided they couldn't afford not
                    to be at the ARF and that, if they were going to come to this meeting, it would
                    be advantageous to issue a conciliatory statement. I think this was one of the
                    things that convinced people that having the ASEAN Regional Forum was a useful
                    forum.The ARF couldn't challenge the Chinese, but it could put a certain amount
                    of pressure on the Chinese and force the Chinese to take opinions in the region
                    into account in ways that the Chinese wouldn't have had to do if the
                    organization didn't exist. Winston and Christopher were all really very pleased
                    with the way this worked out. One year after its creation, the ARF was serving
                    as a significant forum for discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that area, I remember it was an area of contention
                        back when I was in South Vietnam in the '70s. But Vietnam and the sort of
                        peace in China always claimed to, the thought being that there might be oil
                        around there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, that's correct.On the Vietnamese side of the South China Sea there
                    are some exploration blocks in the Vietnamese exclusive economic zone where oil
                    has been found and it's being produced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On this issue, the reef issue, were we being very careful
                        to take a back seat or were we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>BROWN: To my disappointment, the answer to that is yes. That spring I took the
                    lead in drafting a new statement of U.S. policy on the South China Sea. I hoped
                    it would include a clear statement of U.S. opposition to military moves that
                    would threaten peace in the region. Winston Lord's view was that the Chinese
                    would see this as a challenge and that the U.S. already had enough problems in
                    our bilateral relations with China. The U.S. should not be out in front on the
                    Mischief Reef question. Yes, we have interests, but we shouldn't be out there
                    leading the charge to challenge the Chinese in this area. We should leave that
                    to the claimants. So, when we worked out this new statement of U.S. policy, it
                    represented some advance from earlier very general statements, but it did not
                    assert in any way that the U.S. was going to play a role of trying to diffuse
                    tensions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you were disappointed. Did you feel that we
                        should have played a more aggressive role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, I thought that we were dealing with a dynamic in the South China Sea
                    in which all of the claimants, the Vietnamese, the Filipinos, the Chinese, the
                    Malaysians were taking actions that provoked the others to respond.The situation
                    could easily get out of hand and require some response by the U.S. This had
                    happened in the Paracels in the 1970, when the Chinese attacked and drove the
                    Vietnamese out of the islands, with considerable casualties.Rather than waiting,
                    it would be better to encourage the claimants to work our some rules of the
                    game. The actual idea our office was advocating was that there ought to be an
                    agreement by all of the parties not to occupy any new territory nor
                    substantially reinforce existing positions. We thought that the U.S. ought to be
                    much more active particularly working with the Indonesians which as the biggest
                    country in Southeast Asia had been active on these issues.Winston said, no. This
                    would essentially mean organizing people to resist the Chinese and we don't need
                    to do that. Let them do it on their own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, out of this whole issue raises the question
                        that has been around for a hell of a long time and that is the expansion of
                        China. I mean everybody has been watching China. Are they really planning to
                        exert their influence? I mean it's an empire that's sort of grown and
                        contracted and grown and contracted. This was one place that, it may be a
                        small reef, but it still was representative of aggression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: If you look around the periphery of China, there are a couple of places
                    where there are minor territorial disputes. However, there is no evidence that
                    the Chinese are seeking territorial aggrandizement. The South China Sea is a
                    sensitive area because there are unresolved competing claims to essentially
                    uninhabitable areas unless one builds artificial structures. This is a very
                    unique area and one shouldn't draw conclusions about general Chinese behavior
                    from what they will do in the South China Sea. After Mischief Reef, the Chinese
                    didn't expand their footprint in the area.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which results in having a group of people, a group of
                        nations getting together and looking at this in the cold light of day and
                        making certain actions sort of unacceptable. Which if it was just between
                        one country and another, particularly if one country is China, it's a little
                        harder to face it down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It didn't happen on my watch, but subsequently the idea of no new outposts
                    has in fact been worked into the code of conduct in the South China Sea, which
                    was adopted in 2002, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any efforts to get with this regional organization get
                        rescue of distressed vessels or don't provoke each other by military ships
                        getting too close together? Things that sort of day to day regulations of
                        how one conducts oneself in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Not during my time. Things had to develop very slowly, but subsequent to
                    my leaving that office there have been cooperative meetings on disaster relief
                    and particularly in the role of militaries in disaster relief operations and on
                    search and rescue. What are the rules of the road with respect to distressed
                    vessels? What is the law that relates to international search and rescue in the
                    waters of the Pacific? There have been cooperative activities, practicing search
                    and rescue procedures, all done under the auspices of the ARF. Again the U.S.
                    has been a proponent of this because this is a way to bring the militaries of
                    the various countries together to talk to discuss common problems and build
                    habits of cooperation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When one looks at our, within the Foreign Service, at the
                        European bureau and all, we've got a very strong cadre of people who deal
                        with international relations. NATO, OSCE, you know what I mean, all of these
                        organizations and so we have officers who can go back and forth between
                        Geneva, Paris, Belgium, Brussels and London and all over. How about within
                        Asia? At the time we're talking about, was there something like this or were
                        you the beginning of a new breed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There was no cadre of people like this in the EAP bureau. There had been
                    no organizations for them to be working in and developing expertise. Now that's
                    beginning to happen. The current head of the office of Regional and Security
                    Policy, Rick DeVillafranca, had been involved in the early discussion of these
                    regional and security dialogues. There is now a group of people who have been
                    attending these meetings now for almost a decade and they've worked in embassies
                    in the region reporting on host country views of the ARF of issues.</p>
                <p>

                <p>BROWN: In 1996. I only had the pleasure of working on Korea for one year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me during that one year things were always
                        happening on the Korean Peninsula. What was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, let me first do the boring stuff. The boring stuff was
                    reorganization. Up until that time, the North Korean nuclear issue had been
                    dealt with by a special task force run by Bob Galucci with Tom Hubbard, the DAS
                    in EAP, as his deputy. They had negotiated the Agreed Framework with North Korea
                    to put a cap on the nuclear activities at Yongbyong research facility. They had
                    established KEDO, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, to
                    implement parts of that agreement, particularly to build two reactors in North
                    Korea to provide power in theory to compensate for the from reactors which the
                    North Koreans had agreed to shut down.This negotiating process with the North
                    had gotten to the point where we no longer needed a special task force, but we
                    did need a group of people who would work on KEDO and the implementation of this
                    agreed framework.</p>
                <p>The first thing that we worked out in the summer that I came on board was a
                    reorganization in which six people who had been working under Galucci were
                    transferred to a new unit in the Office of Korean Affairs, EAP/K. EAP/K ended up
                    being the largest office in the EAP with about 17 people in it, six or seven of
                    whom were working on the implementation of the Agreed Framework and the rest
                    were the long standing Korea desk which was responsible for political and
                    economic relations with the South and for analysis of North Korea. It worked out
                    quite well in part because Joel Witt joined EAP/K.He had been in the Political
                    Military Bureau with Galucci and he moved to the Korea desk to lead this unit
                    that dealt with KEDO issues. A lot of what we were doing at that time was
                    getting KEDO up and running and supporting their initial negotiations with North
                    Korea. In this period, the basic agreement on the construction of the new
                    reactors was concluded, through a very tough negotiation. The negotiating was
                    done by KEDO, but the U.S. was the principal founders of KEDO. So our office had
                    a large role in supporting KEDO in the negotiating process.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>There was al lot happening on the KEDO front in my time. One example was the
                    canning of fuel rods that had been taken out of the North Korean reactors at
                    Yongbyong. We had a team of three or four employees of the Energy Department at
                    this reactor site along with several IAEA inspectors. They were working with the
                    North Koreans to can this spent fuel and put it in canisters in storage ponds
                    where it would be secure pending eventual removal from North Korea. You can't
                    imagine how difficult it was to support these people from DOE in North Korea,
                    without any U.S. consular or diplomatic presence in the North.For example, each
                    time they went in they had to take dollars in cash because cash was the only
                    payment acceptable to the North. These people had to live at the reactor site
                    where there was no entertainment whatsoever. Inevitably incidents would occur.
                    One Saturday night, one of our people got drunk and spilled some beer on a North
                    Korean newspaper. The paper happened to have a picture of Kim Jong-il, the North
                    Korean leader, on it. The next day our man was accused of insulting the dignity
                    of the “dear leader.” So, it took a week to work this out.</p>
                <p>When the negotiations between KEDO and the North Koreans would get to an apparent
                    impasse, the North would go into a brinkmanship mode and at times bully our
                    people in Yongbyong.They were threatened with being expelled. Or North Korea
                    would refuse to approve replacement personnel who we wanted to rotate in to
                    relieve those at the reactor site. Then, we would have to persuade those at the
                    reactor site to stay on and figure out how to get some more cash to them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying how do you work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, how do you just work collaboratively with people when there has been
                    no basis of mutual experience in collaborative activity?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whom did you talk to? I mean you're sitting here in the
                        United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, the immediate channel of communication was through the North Korean
                    mission at the UN. We did not have an office in Pyongyang. The agreed framework
                    included a provision for establishing Liaison Offices in each other's capitals
                    but that had not been implemented. We tried to set up the liaison office, but
                    the North reneged on that. So we arranged for the Swedes to act as our
                    protecting power. So, that if our people at Yongbyong at ran into difficulties,
                    the Swedish Embassy would represent U.S. interests and help them. Apart from the
                    substantive policy issues being negotiated, there was a constant stream of
                    practical problems to be handled. You never knew what you were going to be
                    running into when you arrived in the office in the morning. What new thing had
                    happened in North Korea that you'd have to deal with?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you running into a problem that politically anything
                        dealing with North Korea was seen as a sellout by elements within congress
                        or the press or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, the Republican led Congress was very skeptical about the North
                    Koreans and the Agreed Framework.That leads me to the second thing that I
                    thought was very important and I still think is very important which directly
                    involved the congress.That was the issue of humanitarian assistance. In the fall
                    of 1995 the North Koreans surprised the world by acknowledging that they had had
                    natural disasters that had created a famine in the North.Pyongyang made a
                    statement that it would be prepared to receive international humanitarian food
                    assistance.This was a very significant departure for a country whose policy had
                    essentially been to close itself off from the rest of the world.All of us
                    dealing with the Agreed Framework realized that unless the North Koreans decided
                    as a whole to open up their economy, it would never be possible to make the
                    reactor project a success. So when North Korea Low announced that they were
                    prepared to accept foreign aid and would accept an international assessment team
                    from the World Food Program, which was seen as very important opportunity.</p>
                <p>The question then was how was the U.S. going to respond? In the following months,
                    we went through three steps. The first one was how do we give the standard
                    $25,000 that the U.S. can hand out in an emergency. Normally, the ambassador has
                    the right to provide this princely sum of $25,000 on his own authority right
                    away. So, what do you do when you don't have an office or an ambassador? Well,
                    we got the Assistant Secretary to make a determination that there had been a
                    famine and we would donate $25,000. But as paltry as this sum was, we realized
                    we had to consult with the Hill. We did so without trouble. We also had to
                    consult with Seoul, which was then under President Kim Yong-sam who was a real
                    hardliner on North Korea.</p>
                <p>Then when the initial assessments from the WFP came in and the North Koreans were
                    shown to have very substantial needs, we decided to take another step and give
                    them a quarter of a million dollars. We went through the same process,
                    consulting with the South Koreans and with the congress. At this stage questions
                    were raised. How are you going to monitor aid? Is it going to go to the
                    military? We were able to say that we would give the aid through the WFP and
                    that the WFP would have people on the ground in North Korea supervising the way
                    it was given out so that you would know that it was going to children and
                    pregnant women and not the military. It wasn't easy. There were a lot of people
                    who didn't like it, but the law is written in such a way that the Secretary of
                    State has the ability without actually requiring any congressional approval to
                    give humanitarian aid wherever he thinks its needed. The various sanctions on
                    economic ties with North Korea do not apply to humanitarian assistance.The
                    Congress had written this legislation. We were able to proceed.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>When the final WFP report came out, this was actually the following spring when
                    the North Koreans admitted they were still having food problems, we went to the
                    Hill a third time for two million dollars of food assistance again through the
                    WFP. We learned some tactics. We were well advised to go to the agricultural
                    committees and figure out which senators and states had excess agricultural
                    commodities that they wanted to get disposed. Arrange a mix of commodities so
                    that congressmen would be happy that their constituent's interests were being
                    looked after. It took a lot of work because you had suspicions in the congress
                    and you had a government in Seoul which was not itself well disposed to giving
                    aid to the North. A very different situation with Seoul than we have today. So,
                    you had to bring the South along because if you didn't bring the South along
                    they would go to the Hill, and the congress would become a much bigger problem,
                    so the whole thing had to be managed very carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our reading on Kim Jong-il, his group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: He was a mystery. We as Americans had no contact with him. He was still t
                    that time in a period of mourning for his father's death. He dragged this out
                    for three years. It was reasonably clear that he was in the process of trying to
                    consolidate his grip on power in North Korea. He was very much a mystery at the
                    time.He had an image among some as a corrupt playboy. Very little evidence was
                    yet available on how he would act as a leader now that his father had died. He
                    had almost no contact with the outside. This has changed subsequently, but in
                    '95 to '96 he was a mystery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it we didn't have the equivalent Kreminologists
                        that we used to have and used to sit and talk about who was doing what to
                        whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, yes, you watch this and the South Koreans watched it even more closely
                    than we did. Who was making appearances, with whom, at what kind of activities?
                    At that time, Kim was almost always at military events. If you look at American
                    involvement with Kim now, I mean Madeline Albright has met him. Other visitors
                    have met him. We've had substantial dealings with North Korea on food aid, on
                    the reactor project, on the agreed framework, on the recovery of remains of
                    American soldiers who were buried in various places in North Korea during the
                    Korean War. We've had the visit of the number two man in Korea to Washington.
                    There have been very extensive contacts with their government. But in the
                    earlier period the only real dealings we had had was in the context of Galucci's
                    negotiations. From that you did know that Kim was, after the death of his
                    father, able to make some sensible decisions.But at that time, no American had
                    met him, talked to him, had any direct contact and in fact very few of any
                    foreigners had had any contact with him.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had two contacts one with Korea, one was an airman
                        second class in sitting off Chodo Island, sitting on Chodo Island up in
                        North Yellow Sea and then later as consul general in Seoul in '76 to '79,
                        but was there the perception that an attack could come anytime? I mean, you
                        know, we've had, it's been 50 years now of tension on the border, but except
                        for forays from time to time, the blue house raid and a few other things,
                        its nothing major has happened. What was the feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: If you went for a briefing at U.S. Forces Korea, they would emphasize the
                    threat posed by the North. They would be able to talk to you about the kind of
                    training the North had been doing and show you the number of new artillery
                    pieces that they believe had been placed in caves along just north of the DMZ.
                    They would talk about our intelligence on chemical weapons and so forth. So,
                    USFK portrayed a picture of the North, which was still consistent with the idea
                    that at some point they might attack the South and try to unify the country in
                    keeping with their propaganda.</p>
                <p>At the same time if you looked at the balance between the North and the South,
                    you would recognize that the North's economy had been in decline and for at
                    least five years, that their sources of support in the Soviet Union and China
                    had dried up, that the military looked like a decrepit organization.The North
                    was balanced against South Korea, which was the 11th largest economy in the
                    world. It had just been admitted to the OECD as a member developed world and had
                    an army of 650,000 people equipped with some of the best equipment that the U.S.
                    could provide them, well-trained on their own and with the American armed
                    forces. My judgment and the judgment of others who weren't directly involved in
                    the U.S. forces Korea was that the South Koreans could probably handle the North
                    Koreans pretty much on their own.If we weren't in a confrontation with the North
                    over the nuclear issue, I believed the U.S. really should be involved in
                    withdrawing a substantial portion of the American military from Korea because it
                    wasn't needed anymore.</p>

                <p>BROWN: Yes, a recurrent irritant and we've seen that of course more recently.</p>

                <p>BROWN: That's right and that's the way I saw North Korea, that it was a
                    vulnerable, fragile state and that Kim's basic concern was to consolidate his
                    own control and that this array of forces north of the DMZ was in effect a
                    deterrent against either South Korea or the U.S. using force against him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling at that time for something which
                        seems to be a considerable concern on the part of China and that is anything
                        happening in North Korea would mean an exodus of umpteen million poor,
                        starving Koreans into China and this means that the Chinese don't want any
                        change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, you saw that.The Chinese didn't talk much about their bilateral ties
                    with North Korea, but it was pretty clear to us through various intelligence
                    channels that in the early '90s the Chinese had substantially scaled back their
                    aid to the North and done away with friendship pricing on goods sold to the
                    north. Then when the famine occurred in North Korea, the Chinese were clearly
                    beginning to reassess what they were doing vis-�-vis the North. Even though they
                    never gave any aid to the world food program, we were convinced that they became
                    the largest donor to the North of food assistance. They are the principal
                    supplier of petroleum, i.e., energy supplies through Northeast China.The Chinese
                    reversed their policy in '95 and '96 and decided that this famine was
                    undermining stability in the North and that they would have to provide
                    substantial aid to avoid instability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you talk about it, an awful lot of countries that
                        really despise this regime are doing everything they can to keep it going.
                        The Japanese, the United States, the South Koreans, the Chinese. How about
                        the Russians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>BROWN: They don't have much capability in terms of resources to make a meaningful
                    contribution, but you're right. In some ways, providing aid is repugnant because
                    this regime is as brutal and as inhumane towards its own people as you can
                    imagine. It was and is a government that is prepared to see its own people
                    starve while putting substantial resources into its own military establishment
                    and threatening the rest of the world with weapons of mass destruction. It is
                    repugnant. My view as the director of Korean Affairs was our policy was not to
                    overthrow the regime but to encourage change. I saw the Agreed Framework as a
                    vehicle for encouraging change because, as I said, if the North Koreans were
                    going to implement it through to the end they were going to have to open up
                    their society.</p>
                <p>One key issue was how to tie the new reactors into the power grid. The power grid
                    in North Korea was dilapidated. It couldn't possibly handle the power that would
                    be produced by two nuclear reactors. The North Koreans tried to pressure KEDO
                    into agreeing to build a new electrical grid for them as part of the reactor
                    project. KEDO said, no. The way to get the grid is to go to the World Bank. The
                    north didn't like that answer because they knew that would mean they would have
                    to open up their whole economy to the scrutiny of the World Bank. They still
                    haven't agreed to do that, but what we were trying to do was not just deal with
                    an immediate non-proliferation problem, but to bring about fundamental change in
                    North Korean society through the vehicle of the agreed framework. We saw the
                    humanitarian food aid as another way for doing this. We were prepared to invite
                    the North Koreans into the ASEAN Regional Forum. It didn't happen on my watch.
                    It happened later.There were other things we were prepared to do, but the North
                    hasn't followed through on many of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has regressed. What about South Korea itself? The time
                        you were there, how did you view the situation in South Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: As I said we were dealing with President Kim Yong-sam, who on the one hand
                    was a fighter for democracy, but on the other hand had very negative and hostile
                    approach to dealing with the North at a time when the U.S. was trying to engage
                    the North on a number of fronts.So we had a very difficult time working with Kim
                    administration. We finally cut a deal with him and the deal was this. Kim
                    Yong-sam wanted President Clinton to visit South Korea when he went to Japan in
                    1996. Clinton worked through Tony Lake who was the.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: National Security Advisor.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>BROWN: National Security Advisor. Lake went to Seoul with a message, which said,
                    if you would agree to an initiative to get North South dialogue started, the
                    president will come and visit South Korea. This initiative put our office in a
                    tricky position.For reasons that never explained explicitly, the president
                    wanted Lake to handle this relationship through his contacts with Kim's national
                    security advisor rather than having my boss, Warren Christopher, be the point
                    man on this issue. Perhaps Lake wanted some credit for an initiative. Anyways,
                    Lake and his deputy asked our office for some help in drafting their telegrams
                    to Seoul but insisted that we not inform Christopher. Nevertheless, I discreetly
                    informed Winston Lord what we were doing, and got his agreement. My deputy Dick
                    Christiansen, who knew a lot more about Korea than I did, was involved in this
                    process, too. We were writing the telegrams for Lake to send to Seoul to work
                    out the presidential visit.</p>
                <p>The focus of the presidential visit was going to be the announcement of what we
                    called the four party peace talks proposal. The Americans and the South Koreans
                    on one side, the North Koreans and the Chinese on the other side. We would start
                    a process of dialogue about peace on the peninsula. This was a cover essentially
                    for finding a way to get the North and the South to talk to each other. All this
                    was worked out without in the end any bad blood that I could detect between
                    Christopher and Lake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it didn't seem to be the almost priceless
                        relationship that developed with the National Security Advisor Brezinski and
                        Kissinger and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: No. The dynamic of this essentially was the White House didn't want anyone
                    knowing we were trying to work out this kind of a proposal with the South
                    Koreans because if it fell apart the knowledge that it had fallen apart would
                    further poison North South relations.Lord told Christopher and those who needed
                    to know knew what was going on. We did work out a statement that would be made
                    by the two presidents. We put considerable pressure on Kim not to screw the
                    whole thing up by making an anti-North Korean statement while the president was
                    standing next to him. We agreed on the text of the announcement and on what each
                    of the Presidents would say. To ensure that it would be seen in the North as a
                    serious offer, we insisted that both the South Koreans and we would use our
                    private channels in advance to alert the North that a proposal would be made.
                    The meeting took place on Cheju Island.The president met for about four hours
                    together and announced the four party peace proposal.</p>
                <p>Our prior notification to the north was done through the New York office. We gave
                    them a few hours advance notice so they knew what was coming and that it was a
                    serious effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>BROWN: They were not happy with this because they weren't one of the four. They
                    were U.S. allies, which China was not, and they were paying a billion dollars
                    for the KEDO.They were not happy, but they were told about it in advance and
                    chose not to object publicly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that Japanese relationship ever since the Japanese
                        colonial effort in Korea has always it still, you can't use the Japanese
                        very easily with the Koreans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Though not on my watch, South Korean dealings with Japan have improved
                    rather remarkably in the last five or six years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things are moving. I have to say you know, we're right now
                        going through a phase of anti-Americanism all around the world, but as I do
                        these oral histories we're documenting efforts to try and bring peace,
                        reconciliation with all sorts of problems and false starts and everything
                        else. Essentially I can't help feeling that we are a major force for trying
                        to better foreign relations and to have a more peaceful world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: While this is a bit off the subject, one of the things that disappoints me
                    most about our policy in Iraq right now is that we seem to be abandoning a lot
                    that we have worked so hard for as a country for four or five decades. We are
                    reverting dangerously to a policy of might makes right. I think it's terribly
                    destructive to our international legitimacy and our ability to do a lot of very
                    positive things by working collaboratively with other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, David, is there anything we should talk about
                        on the Korean thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, it's been a good solid session. We'll stop at
                        this point. Let's see you retired in '97.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In 1996.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '96.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a planned retirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>BROWN: No, it was the up or out problem. I didn't get my promotion to minister
                    counselor, so I was retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you certainly had a fascinating go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Oh, I loved it. I would have been prepared to keep going, but none of the
                    things that were offered to me worked out. I was asked if I wanted to be on the
                    list fro Brunei, which I declined. I was put on the short list for Director of
                    AIT in Taipei, which I dearly wanted to get. But the job went to Darryl Johnson,
                    a friend and someone eminently well qualified. All the things I thought I'd done
                    that were very meaningful didn't manage to get me promoted or another job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a public relations, I don't know what it is. You
                        watch this. It's a throw of the dice. What about, what have you been doing
                        afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Well, I went to work for Doug Paul who had a small think tank devoted to
                    Asia called the Asia Pacific Policy Center. I did that for two years. In the
                    second of those years, I also picked up a job over here at FSI running East Asia
                    two-week courses three times a year and I did that for three years. In the midst
                    of doing that FSI work I was offered the opportunity to go to work at SAIS in
                    their Asian studies department. I was hired essentially to help them administer
                    the programs, but I've gotten into a teaching role as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one last question. Do you find the decisiveness of
                        Asia is there a thrust or a theme some people who teach there and all, do
                        they come from various angles or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We have quite a diverse mix of people within the Asian Studies Department.
                    Most of the people there have experience both in the academic world and in
                    government. So, what SAIS strives to do is to combine rigorous academic
                    standards and a practical attention to contemporary problems. We have a rigorous
                    language requirement in our program, strong economic requirements. I think we
                    probably have in the Washington area, maybe in the country, the best area
                    studies kind of program on Asia at the graduate level. The most recent addition
                    being a program on South Asia. We have an Indian scholar who has been teaching
                    in London for 15 years and Walter Anderson who you may know from INR.</p>
