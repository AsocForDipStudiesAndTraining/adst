                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 24th of May, 2002. This is an interview with
                        Patrick A. Mulloy, that?s M U L L O Y, this is being done on behalf of the
                        Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I?m Charles Stuart
                        Kennedy. Do you go by Pat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. Pat is fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let?s start at the beginning. Could you tell me when
                        and where you were born, tell me something about your family first on the
                        father?s side, then the mother?s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on September 14th, 1941. On my
                    father?s side, my granddad was an anthracite coal miner. He died before I was
                    born, but my understanding is that he came from Ireland as a young man, and got
                    into the mines. My father who was born in 1898 left school at age thirteen and
                    went into the mines and drove a mule. When World War I came along he went into
                    the Navy, then never went back into the mines after the war. During the 1920s he
                    lived in Chicago, and then in Cleveland. He became a bookkeeper, and then
                    returned to Northeastern Pennsylvania. Regarding my mother?s family, I think it
                    was my great grandparents came over from Ireland. My great granddad on my
                    mother?s side was digging canals. Somehow or other he saved some money and
                    bought a dairy farm. My grandmother on my mother?s side was a domestic in New
                    York City, and their families connected them to one another, and then they got
                    married and lived on the farm. That dairy farm was where my mother was born. My
                    mother?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her maiden name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Meagher. M E A G H E R. My mother grew up on the dairy farm, went to
                    Pleasant Mount high school, which is in Wayne County in far Northeastern
                    Pennsylvania, and then went to East Stroudsburg Normal School in the summers and
                    taught in a one room country schoolhouse during the winters. She did that for a
                    number of years. After she got married, she was 29 when she got married, my
                    father was 38, and my mother didn?t work after that.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way what you?re saying is a classic story of part of
                        the Irish migration to the United States. Very sort of working your way up
                        and, you know it?s a success story, it?s almost classic. Well, how did you
                        find, growing up in your family, did Irishness, did this permeate the old
                        sod and all that, or was this something kind of left behind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It was Catholicism permeated more than Irishness. I grew up in a town
                    called Kingston, Pennsylvania, which was across the Susquehanna River from
                    Wilkes-Barre. Many of the surrounding communities were mining towns. Kingston
                    was not a mining town in the sense that a lot of people worked in the mines. It
                    was mainly a Protestant town. We went to the Catholic Church. I didn?t get a
                    sense of being professionally Irish, and I went to public schools the first
                    seven years because we didn?t have Catholic grammar schools. There was no parish
                    school. When I was in eighth grade, there were thirteen different parishes on
                    the west side of the Susquehanna River, which pooled their resources and
                    developed a Central Catholic high school, which was equal in size to the public
                    high schools in the area. I went there. It started with only the 7th, 8th and
                    9th grades, and I started in the 8th grade. And that was an important thing in
                    my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let?s talk about early life. When you were going to public
                        school was there any subject that sort of grabbed you more than others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was always a good student. I can?t say I was a disciplined student to
                    begin with. I can remember when we would have free reading time I would have the
                    encyclopedias and I would be reading about Hannibal, the Roman Empire, and World
                    War II and other areas of history. I always liked to read about history and what
                    had happened. So that was my keen interest. I remember in 7th grade I was still
                    in the public school, we had a civics class and learned about the Congress in
                    Washington and the Government. And I remember I just got such a high, it was
                    like something struck me as ?Oh, God, wouldn?t it be exciting to be part of all
                    that?. And my mother loved civics and government and had a similar interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the family strongly political, I assume more
                        democratic, but maybe not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: We were Democrats. My father was born in 1898, so when I was born it was
                    like having a history lesson there and my mother was older too. They had seen a
                    lot of the events of the early 20th century. So we had discussions about World
                    War I and World War II and the Depression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Depression was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>MULLOY: The event. My father used to talk about Al Smith, and what a great man he
                    was. He was also very high on FDR and Truman. And I remember in 1948 when Harry
                    Truman came to town, we all went out and waved, saw him go by in an open car,
                    and then later on when Adlai Stevenson was running for President in ?52, he came
                    through and we went up to see him as well. So we were Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice that there was a sharp division, or that
                        being Catholic in this school singled you out, was this something that was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I started grade school at Loveland Avenue, a school which is now gone,
                    but it was in Kingston, Pennsylvania where I grew up. The Principal was Mary
                    O?Donnell, and my first grade teacher was Mary McCarthy. And it was really
                    funny, if you went up one track, there were two first grades and two second, and
                    if you went up one track you got a lot of Irish teachers and if you went up the
                    other track you?ve got a lot of Protestant teachers. And I just happened to get
                    in the track where there were a lot of Irish. Now when I went to the sixth and
                    seventh grades, there was another school I went to, the Main Street School and
                    there were more Protestant than Catholic teachers in that school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the kids pretty well intermixed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. We all got along very well and were not too conscious of religious
                    differences. Once in a while like on St. Patrick?s Day there were a number of
                    students of Welsh background you know and some of them would wear orange and I
                    would pay attention to that. That was what it was like in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did, going back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well we can talk more about that because there was a later period when I
                    was in High School that we experienced some religious discrimination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We?ll come to that, but I was wondering, what were you,
                        how did you family fare during the Depression? Because this is, this is
                        probably the most traumatic event of the last century for America.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, I think that was more difficult on my father?s side than on my
                    mother?s side. Because somehow being on the dairy farm and having that income
                    they didn?t get as impacted. I know my father was unemployed for some period of
                    time during the depression, and we never had a lot of money. You knew that that
                    had been a very difficult period of life for people, and people would talk about
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to, at home, was reading encouraged at all,
                        were your mother and father readers? What about brothers and sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was one of four children. I was the third child, and the first boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother was having children late for that era, she
                        married when she was 29.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: 29, right. My younger brother, the 4th child, was born mentally retarded,
                    which was very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, very difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: In that era, before people opened up about that. But yes, we did, I can
                    remember first or second grade, joining the library. It was a good public
                    library. But it was funny, you had to show them your hands, make sure your hands
                    were clean before you could take out books. And they would put a star on your
                    library card to show that you?d behaved properly. (laughter) But it was just a
                    free source of books, and I loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the library of course, is so influential to people
                        who are interested.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It is. My mother and father did read, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, you know as you?re moving up before you get to high
                        school, what kind of books did you read, do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I used to read all kinds of books including science fiction and those
                    Landmark history books. You know, Lewis and Clark, George Washington, Lincoln,
                    Napoleon. These Landmark books were quite good.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember reading them.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>MULLOY: I remember when I was in third grade I got a book on Robin Hood, which
                    was too difficult, and then I went back and got it when I was in fifth
                    grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, by the time you got, when you moved to this
                        later, you moved up towards high school and all that. How did you find
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: When I went to this newly opening Catholic high school, it started with
                    only seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. I was in the eighth grade, and the
                    opening for this was September 1954, actually it opened on September 8th, 1954,
                    which is significant in Catholic thinking because September 8 is the Nativity of
                    the Blessed Virgin Mary. And 1954 was a Marion year, which means dedicated to
                    the Virgin. And we were all standing in line to go to church, to start the
                    school year, and nobody knew anyone. As I was wont to do, I was clowning around,
                    and this woman, a big nun, grabbed me, and sai?We don?t behave like that here
                    young man.? And she put me back down. And I said to myself ?Oh, I hope I never
                    see her again.? And then she turned out to be my eighth grade homeroom teacher,
                    and my main teacher in eighth grade. Her name was Sister Rose de Lima, and she
                    was just a great teacher for me. She encouraged me. She used to sa?Empty drums
                    make the most noise, and you don?t have to be clowning around to get attention.
                    Study, be smart, you can do things.?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, you know there are all sorts of stories
                        about the nuns, I mean we have some people who are practically in their
                        sixties when they talk about breaking into a sweat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I never felt that, I felt that they were always in my corner, they were
                    wonderful people. For me the priests and the nuns were great people,
                    encouraging. And some of the things you hear about now knock your socks off, but
                    they were great people. And I think a different era of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I?m thinking maybe of the strictness of the nuns, the
                        discipline in those days, I mean there weren?t a lot of people getting all
                        concerned, I think also it?s meant for a tidier class, better education
                        environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: But this nun, who later on - I became an Assistant Secretary of Commerce
                    and was invited by my high school to be the commencement speaker in June 1998.
                    She was in a nursing home up in that area and I brought her to that event and
                    then took her out to dinner.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That?s great. Now, when you moved to this school, what
                        about social life? Was social life, again I?m not trying to over-emphasize
                        religious differences but these were much more apparent, I think in that
                        era, that?s why I like to do a little document, I mean, did you find if you
                        dated, you know ?Why don?t you date a nice little Catholic school? from your
                        parents or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: No, no, no, it?s just, once you were in the Catholic school, the people
                    that you ran into were Catholics. And it just evolved that way that I did date
                    Catholic girls. What happened, as I said, we were the first big Catholic school
                    that actually fielded football and wrestling teams in that era. The smaller
                    Catholic schools had basketball teams, but we were able to have football and
                    basketball and track, and wrestling, and I was active, a very good wrestler, and
                    I was on the track team. Tried football for a couple years but I wasn?t too good
                    at that. But when we tried to get into the Conference of the local schools they
                    wouldn?t let us in. So we had to travel to Scranton and other places around the
                    state to find schools to play. Because the schools right in our immediate area
                    wouldn?t play us. That changed, all dramatically, when Kennedy became president.
                    The culture changed up there. And then they did get into the Conference. But
                    that was what we?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it was sort of, it wasn?t, what would you call it,
                        discrimination, you know, ?We?re not going to let any Catholic school into
                        this league.? or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well it was, and I remember there would be articles in the paper to
                    debate all of this. It was said we somehow had an unfair advantage because we
                    were recruiting from thirteen parishes. You know, not just one town but also a
                    lot of different towns. And so there was the rationale. It did not make a lot of
                    sense as our school was not bigger than many of the public schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, what were you particularly interested in
                        taking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well we had a pretty set curriculum, if you were college prep, which I
                    was, and the biggest regret I think, we didn?t take typing for example, that?s
                    the most important skill! (laughter) I tell my kids the most important skills
                    are typing and writing. To be able to write. But you know, we took Latin, and
                    general science, and then algebra 1, algebra 2, trig, geometry. And we took
                    physics and chemistry and biology and general science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The full thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Two years of German. So we took that curriculum though high school. There
                    was a classical curriculum where you could take four years of Latin and do more
                    of that type of thing but I was in what they called the scientific curriculum.
                    My father was very good in math and those things and he was hoping I might go in
                    that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, while you were there, how about summer jobs and all
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, one summer I went up and worked on the dairy farm with my uncles
                    and my cousins, that was a great summer. We would milk the cows and bring in the
                    hay, and when you look back now we used to go out in the fields with the hay
                    wagon. We?d go through the fields and pick up rocks, pile them on the wagon, put
                    them on the road and then hammer them, break them up with sledgehammers to make
                    sure the road wouldn?t get muddy. Thinking about that now, you think wow, that?s
                    prison labor. It was hard work, but God was I fit. It helped my wrestling. And
                    then later on, I had other summer jobs. I was very lucky in high school, and I
                    had good coaches, and they said play sports, be involved in your school, you can
                    work the rest of your life. And so I didn?t take part time jobs in high school,
                    I took summer jobs. For two years, the cook at our school got to be the cook at
                    a summer camp, and he took a group of us who were athletes from the school, we
                    were the kitchen crew at the summer camp two years in a row. And that was great
                    for summer. It was a fun time. That was during the summers of 1958 and 1959.
                    ?58, when, wasn?t that the year we put troops into Lebanon?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And there was a complication with the Russians?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I remember how interested we were, we had the radio on all the time,
                    paying attention to what was going on. And whatever papers we used to get we?d
                    read about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a newspaper reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was. We had the local Wilkes-Barre papers, but on Sunday my father
                    always bought the Philadelphia paper, the Philadelphia Bulletin. And I used to
                    really go through that paper, and I loved the op-ed pieces that you could learn
                    more about politics.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Q: Well this, is one of the things that even today holds true. To really,
                    particularly in a lot of fields, but in the Foreign Affairs field, the
                    government field, you really have to be a newspaper reader. It?s how you gain
                    your knowledge.</p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think that proved helpful later on taking the Foreign Service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you?re getting ready to graduate, what, in 1959 or
                        so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, I graduated from high school in ?59. I was a Student Council
                    President. I won that in a school-wide election. Another event that happened in
                    high school, it was going into my senior year, I was selected by my school to go
                    to the American Legion Boys? State, and it was a week long camp like program put
                    on by the American Legion. You were supposed to learn Government but we learned
                    politics, because you had to run for offices at the local and State level. I ran
                    for State Treasurer and won. I had to make a speech in front of everyone, it was
                    exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a great experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did politics ever interest you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It did. I graduated in ?59. Of course John Kennedy ran for President in
                    1960, I can tell you about that if you want to get to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, we?ll get to that. But while you?re in high school
                        towards the end what were you pointed towards?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MULLOY: You know, the one failure with the school I went to was its guidance
                    department. I knew I was smart and I tested pretty well, had good grades and was
                    very involved in extra curricular activities. I probably could have gotten some
                    scholarships to major colleges if people had steered me right. I did get a
                    scholarship to a local Catholic college, King?s College, which is run by the
                    Holy Cross Order of Priests, who also run Notre Dame. I took some tests, and
                    then they wrote and they sai?You?re accepted here.? But I did not know how to
                    pay for it. By the time May rolled around my senior year I was very worried
                    because I didn?t know what I was going to do. I didn?t have anything lined up,
                    and then my father and I, I think in late May we went over to visit with the
                    officials at King?s College. The priest who met us was Father Sheehy. I remember
                    when he came into the room my father and I were sitting, and of course I stood
                    up, because I was trained to do that. We had a very good meeting with him. And
                    then the next thing I knew my principal called me, and said Father Sheehy had
                    called and they were putting together a package for me - a job in the library
                    and a half scholarship. In late June of 1959 I got an official letter telling me
                    that this was done. I was working at the camp that I had earlier talked about in
                    the kitchen crew. It was big news. I was going be able to go to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went to, King?s College for four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I did, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it? I mean, run by a holy order.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. It was all male in those days. It?s co-ed now but it was all
                    male.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You often get a very solid education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think I did get a solid education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was it, about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think there were about eleven hundred males.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good size.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>MULLOY: It was a nice school. It was started in 1946 and it was started by the
                    Bishop of Scranton who enticed the priests of Notre Dame to come and start a
                    college for working class kids in Northeastern Pennsylvania in the Luzerne
                    County area. So it was mainly a lot of working class people from that area. I
                    mean, there were sons of doctors and lawyers and other people but it was, it was
                    for kids that didn?t have a lot of money and it gave us a chance to get an
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of courses were you taking there, and
                        particularly inspired you or caught your eye?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, I started out as an accounting major. Kings had a very good
                    accounting department, and it was a very marketable skill, lots of people came
                    down here to Washington and went into accounting firms. A lot of guys came down
                    here, went into GAO. So I started out as an accountant. My father, who was a
                    bookkeeper, told me he did not think I would find that attractive, but I didn?t
                    quite know what else to do. I wanted to get something where I could get a job.
                    The first semester at King?s I had a history course from a Professor Schleich,
                    who was very good but he was into the trees. You know what I mean?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: He was into the trees rather than the forest. He gave us facts but no
                    overview. The second semester I took my history, it was a history survey,
                    western civilization. I had a Dr. Richard Stevens, who had gone to Notre Dame,
                    and had his Ph.D. from Georgetown. He was more sophisticated. And he taught
                    facts but also what was going on, what was driving these changes, and I remember
                    he?d bring in and we?d listen to Beethoven?s 9th, the Ode to Joy and that sort
                    of stuff. And he used to tell me to read these books about Russia, by Nicholas
                    Berdejev and what was going on over there. And then he said to me, he sai?You
                    don?t belong in accounting, you should go into history.? And I sai?What could I
                    do with that?? And he said ?Well you could be a Foreign Service Officer.? And I
                    said ?What?s that?? And he told me. And I remember a teacher in high school who
                    was in charge of the student government, he had also said something like ?Well,
                    you ought to go to the diplomatic service?, and of course I had no idea what
                    that was. But this Professor at King?s, Dr. Stevens, I asked ?Well, how do you
                    get into that?? and he says ?there?s this test.? And he said, ?We?ll put
                    together a curriculum, we?ll show you what you should be taking over the four
                    years.? So they started up a Great Books seminar that had twelve of us in it for
                    four years, and we would read what the Great Books had to say about religion,
                    what they had to say about politics, what they had to say about science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is all modeled on the Hutchison?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. In fact we used those guide books from the University of Chicago.
                    And I loved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It?s quite a challenge, but it gives you a core set of
                        intellectual assets that you won?t pick up anywhere else, a fantastic
                        opportunity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And then that same Professor, after my sophomore year, he took three of
                    us, two other friends, Pat and John O?Connor, both of whom became lawyers, one
                    of them became a very successful lawyer in Philadelphia. He took us all to
                    Mexico. The four of us went down and we traveled around Mexico and you know, he
                    was opening up and showing you things, it was wonderful.</p>
                <p>Q: Well this is exactly of course what a college like that was designed to do,
                    the plan was to reach down into a working class area and open up the world to
                    the students in there, because thinking of the American system, everybody is
                    capable, but it?s just often they don?t have the opportunity.</p>
                <p>MULLOY: I got a very, very good education. I think the area I didn?t quite get
                    the writing skills I needed and I probably should have taken more courses on
                    writing, but I had more interest in history and philosophy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, how about languages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was very poor in languages. I remember one semester I had five A?s and
                    a D and the D was in French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Welcome to the club. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And it was true, I remember in Latin it was always a difficult matter,
                    later German in high school was tough, and I get to college and take French and
                    I was sweating that. That was the only grade less than a B that I got in all of
                    college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, summer jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>MULLOY: I always did summer jobs. After my freshman year in college I worked in a
                    Stop n? Go. It was like a McDonald?s. I remember I was originally on the grill,
                    cooking the burgers, and then the owner, let?s call it the Stop n? Go, or the
                    fifteen cent hamburger place. I remember the two owners came back and they said
                    ?We hear you?re a college guy.? And I said yes. And they said ?How much is 15 +
                    12?? or something and they gave me a couple things to do in my head, and then
                    they said ?We?re going to give you a little raise and put you on the register.?
                    (Laughter) ?Got off the hot grill.? That was my freshman year in college. My
                    sophomore year, I had a great summer job. I worked at the U.S. Bureau of Mines,
                    down in Schuykill-Haven, Pennsylvania, near where John O?Hara, the author, was
                    from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Oh, yes, yes. He wrote a whole series, wonderful
                        series.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes- a friend of mine, who was a senior at King?s and also the editor of
                    the college newspaper, we lived in a boarding house. We would work all day doing
                    yard work and whatever else they needed done. We were like the handymen at the
                    Bureau of Mines. And then we would sit on the porch and read, and read to each
                    other excerpts of the books we were reading. It was a good summer. Junior year I
                    drove an ice cream truck, one of those ring the bell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good Humor type things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. And then my last year, senior, I worked at a YMCA camp as a
                    counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I forgot to ask the most important thing of any guy going
                        into colleges. Where were the girls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh! There were a couple of girls? colleges in the area, there was a
                    College Misericordia, a college ten miles from Wilkes-Barre, and there was
                    Marywood College up in Scranton, which was all female. Of course those girls
                    focused on boys at the University of Scranton, which was a Jesuit school up in
                    Scranton. And there were a lot of nursing schools. And we?d have these Friday
                    night mixers and the girls would all show up, they used to have the ?cattle car?
                    come in from College Misericordia, and then all these girls from the nursing
                    schools would show up, and that was it. Then there were always football games
                    and basketball games and that?s what you did. I had a clear idea that I did not
                    want to get married for a while. I wanted to see where life was going to go. I
                    had a lot of friends that got married at 21 or 22. I did not want to have family
                    responsibilities before I knew where I was headed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a lot of pressure to do this. Was there ever at
                        all during the time from early age on, was there every any attempt to direct
                        you towards the priesthood or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>MULLOY: You know, I think in eighth grade, some nuns said something like ?you
                    have the hands of a priest.? I tried to be honest with myself. I think there
                    were two things that made me realize it was not for me. One, I knew I really
                    liked women and I was never going to be celibate. I knew I could never
                    discipline myself. Secondly, I had a handicapped brother, and that was always on
                    my mind, how am I going to help my brother Jack? So I knew I wasn?t going to be
                    a priest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to give a feel, how did your family deal with a
                        handicapped brother? Because all of the things that are sort of in place
                        today weren?t?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: They weren?t there. That was a painful period for my brother. He went to
                    the same schools I went to, he would spend two years in the first grade, two
                    years in the second grade, and then after two years they?d move him up on age or
                    whatever. But he wouldn?t learn anything. He didn?t get any special education.
                    And I can talk about that as something, when I was in college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work out, how did, after going through
                        school.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: He quit school at a certain age. I remember it was very painful, he was a
                    peanut man for a while with the Planters Peanut Company, and he would dress up
                    in this peanut man outfit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wear the Planter?s peanut costume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. And President Kennedy had gotten into office in 1961. I had worked
                    in his campaign, and I met him and shook his hand when he came up to that area.
                    I wrote the President a letter and said, ?I?ve got a brother, he?s mentally
                    retarded, and he needs help, what can I do?? And then somehow or other back
                    through the channels, I was instructed to take him to this place for some
                    special education and I did it, and he got an opportunity to get some work
                    skills. Then he worked in a country club for a while, and then on his own later
                    in 1965, he had heard of a job at this college, College Misericordia, that all
                    girls college I mentioned earlier. He went out there on his own and interviewed
                    and he got a job on the kitchen crew, and he?s been there ever since. He?s one
                    of its most valued employees. The President of that College, when Jack was there
                    35 years, they did a big ceremony, and the President wrote me a letter saying
                    what a good guy my brother was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That?s great. I?m sure that the Kennedy Administration,
                        because they had had?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Because of Rosemary ? President Kennedy?s mentally retarded sister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rosemary, they had had and I know the Shrivers spent a
                        great deal of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: They started programs and helped these people become more mainstream. My
                    brother is a good worker, although he still has never learned to read and write.
                    He got married three or four years ago to a handicapped woman. I do the checks,
                    I keep their accounts, I pay their bills, organize their finances for them. I
                    have always done that for my brother.</p>
                <p>Q: That?s heartwarming. How about, when you were at college, what about the
                    politics? First place, you mentioned getting involved in the Kennedy campaign.
                    Did this really strike a responsive chord?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, God, when I was a freshman, President Kennedy was seeking the
                    nomination, and you?d read about the Wisconsin primary and the West Virginia
                    primary, and you know I just got very interested. And my father sai?Don?t get
                    too excited, Al Smith couldn?t win and he was a great American, I don?t think
                    this guy can win.? And I sai?Dad, this guy?s different, I think he can win.? And
                    so he did. When he got the nomination, I remember we stayed up late watching
                    that. He came up to the Wilkes-Barre area in October of 1960, and I was right in
                    the front. And I was struck by his hair. It was more auburn than I had imagined.
                    I shook his hand and then later when his car was leaving, I mean there were
                    thousands and thousands of people, I went racing around and got up to the car
                    and said ?Good luck in November Jack.? I called him Jack and he said ?Thank you
                    very much.? Looked me in the eye. It was a high point. (Laughter) And my father
                    who had had a couple heart attacks, he told me he had also raced up to the car
                    and had shaken Kennedy?s hand. So we were delighted, I was very happy. I was a
                    young Democrat. I was elected to be on Student Government in College. It was a
                    great time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at college, this Foreign Service thing, was
                        this really one of the many things that you were thinking about or were you
                        pretty well looking at that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, I was looking at that. I didn?t know whether I could get into that.
                    I was also thinking about whether to teach. Being a lawyer also entered my head.
                    Kind of those? I did not think of the business or going into a corporation, or
                    those sorts of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, how about military service? Was that hovering around
                        or had that stopped at that point or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>MULLOY: There was the draft, but in our area before thVietnam War heated up,
                    there were a lot of guys that joined up so I think they had a very low draft
                    quota. So it just didn?t play a very big role in thinking about life at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you graduated, what, in ?63?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: June ?63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: What to do now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I came down to Philadelphia in the winter of 1962 and I took a test for
                    the CIA. I also went down to Philadelphia and took the Foreign Service exam some
                    time in 1963. I think it might have been that early September, ?63. By this time
                    I?d won a Fellowship to Notre Dame to be a University Fellow out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this sort of an agreement with Notre Dame?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And King?s?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I had some other fellowships as well. I had won an NDEA at Rutgers. I had
                    four or five different opportunities, but I wanted to go to Notre Dame. I was
                    University Fellow, it was $1,600 a year plus tuition, I think Rutgers was like
                    $2,100 a year, but I wanted to go to Notre Dame. So I went out there as a
                    University Fellow, took the Foreign Service exam that summer of 1963, and then I
                    went out to Notre Dame and then found out that I had passed the written part and
                    then took the oral in Chicago in March of 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions you were asked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Catch the spirit of the thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: There were three people on my oral panel. And one of them turned out to
                    be my first boss, Richard Hawkins. I think he went to Yale. He was from
                    Pittsburgh. And I think he was leader of the three.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One takes the lead, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was taking courses at Notre Dame on Southeast Asian International
                    Relations, Far East International Relations and the Communist ideology. We got
                    into a discussion of China, and whether we should recognize the Communist
                    government in China as the legitimate government in China. And I said that we
                    ought to. And we had a long debate about that, and I had to defend why I thought
                    what I did think. I remember they were saying, ? Well, you know, how can you
                    think that way, they killed all those American boys in Korea?? I stuck with my
                    position and said ?Be realistic, they have control of the country. Start dealing
                    with them.? So I remember that was a key issue. Somehow or other I know it
                    wasn?t current policy but it didn?t prevent me from getting in.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, as a matter of fact, probably the prevailing opinion in the Foreign
                    Service from the beginning was that this was a political decision, not to
                    recognize Red China, that it doesn?t make a hell of a lot of sense. You had the
                    problem of Taiwan. But that was something to be worked out.</p>
                <p>MULLOY: Managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you talked to anybody about the Foreign Service, I
                        mean gotten any other views about this as being, what it was like and
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I didn?t. I never met anyone. Well, yes. When I was at Notre Dame, there
                    was a Foreign Service Officer who came out and spoke to a group. It was a pretty
                    big group, I didn?t have a chance to interact with him too much, but I was very
                    impressed by him, and he talked about our growing involvement in Viet Nam. That
                    was 1964. I remember that impacted on me, and I thought this guy was really
                    impressive. I found him interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling about going into the Foreign
                        Service that, gee, this is a place where guys from wealthy families from
                        Harvard and Yale go and how will I fit in and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I didn?t have enough of an awareness of it. All I knew was that- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I thought more of, well President Kennedy was President. And I just was very
                    interested in what was going on in Washington and politics and government. And I
                    just thought that was my point of entry. That would get me in there. So I didn?t
                    know the culture or anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And government service of course with Kennedy, it was the
                        spirit of the times that this is the place where the action was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, absolutely. You didn?t want to be anywhere else, but to serve the
                    Great Republic. Now there was another thing that was going on in my head that
                    drew me off in a different direction. I had this other thing going on in my
                    head, worrying about my brother, and I had other family responsibilities. So I
                    was asking myself how could I be in the Foreign Service and still do that? So I
                    got toward the end of getting my Master?s at Notre Dame, I could have stayed on
                    in a Ph.D. program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a master?s in history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It was Government and International Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Government and International Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. I got my fellowship out there in history and then when I understood
                    that there was this Government and International Affairs program I switched over
                    into that. We had Gerhart Niemeyer who was a professor on Communism. I?m
                    probably one of the few people who read three volumes of Das Capital. I read all
                    of them, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. (Laughter) We would go to a bookstore in
                    Chicago, a communist bookstore, and buy this stuff cheap. He always told us to
                    buy in cash, not leave any checks. (Laughter) But I enjoyed that. While I was at
                    Notre Dame, I took the LSAT, the law school admission test, and I did pretty
                    well. I applied to a couple law schools. And Villanova offered me room, board,
                    and tuition, a three year free ride. I was a Dougherty fellow. And I was kind of
                    thinking maybe I should go into law and get into politics and I?d be able to
                    take care of my family and stay close at home and that sort of thing, so that
                    was going on in my head. And so I did, I left Notre Dame after I got my Master?s
                    degree. I didn?t get the degree until June ?65, but I finished everything in
                    August ?64, and started going to Villanova Law in September ?64. Once I was
                    there, I began to realize that I wasn?t pursuing my dream, I was letting other
                    things interfere, and that it wasn?t the right thing for me. So I left law
                    school in December of ?64. I got a job teaching at my old high school, in
                    January of 1965. I wrote to the Foreign Service, as they?d already told me I
                    passed the written and oral exams and that I was on the rank order register. So
                    they wrote back and said they could bring me in the March of 1965 class. I had
                    already contracted with my old high school to teach through the school year. So
                    I wrote back and said I couldn?t come, but I could come the next time. Then they
                    wrote back and said you can come in the June ?65 class. So I finished up my
                    teaching and then came down here in June of ?65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you took I assume the A-100 course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I did. Alexander Davit was the head of my A-100 class. He was a wonderful
                    man. I really enjoyed him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It was an exhilarating experience to come down here. In my A-100 there
                    were twenty-five guys in the State Department, and then there were ten USIA
                    people. And this is where I first really became aware that all these guys from
                    these Ivy League schools were into this organization. And they were good, good
                    folks like David Mack who later became an Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I?ve interviewed David.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: John Stemple who was a Ph.D., he was a Princeton guy. David I think went
                    to Harvard. John is teaching at the Patterson School.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Kentucky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Ken Guenther, who you?ve met, was at Commerce. It was fun. These guys
                    were smart. We all achieved this thing to get into this organization. We all
                    stayed together for the first eight weeks in this class, and you?d go up to the
                    Congress and people would come in from other organizations and tell you what was
                    going on, how they worked. It was just a fantastic thing. One thing does stick
                    in my mind that bothered me. This is my recollection. A fellow from the CIA came
                    in and told us, you know, kind of what they do. Earlier in my life I had an
                    opportunity to go into the CIA, remember I told you I went down to Philadelphia
                    and took that test. But I chose not to as I thought that State would be better.
                    I remember the CIA guy came in and talked about China, and I think he said that
                    they broadcast bad information about weather and crops so that people screw up
                    their crops in China and that kind of stuff. And I thought that is horrible, I
                    was thinking of those poor people trying to farm and getting this bad advice and
                    how that would feel, maybe because I?d had that farming experience. (Laughter) I
                    just thought it was wrong and immoral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, did you have any particular specialty or
                        area in mind or were you just going let it in the laps of the gods?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: When I first came down I put it in the laps of the gods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: One of the guys that was in my graduate program in Notre Dame was Ted
                    McNamara. He later came into State and became Ambassador to Columbia and
                    Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs. It was a good group
                    out at Notre Dame, smart guys. Ted I think went to Manhattan College. The
                    Foreign Service really provided people opportunities that they would never have
                    had if they did not have the exam system.</p>
                <p>Q: One of the things I think I?m proving if I do these oral histories, that the
                    backgrounds of people coming in are really across the board, particularly I
                    think now it?s going to be a little more homogenized, because more people are
                    educated. You know, my parents didn?t go to college, your parents didn?t go to
                    college, it was, now I suspect that 99% of the incoming people, parents went to
                    college, it just shows the demographics of change.</p>
                <p>MULLOY: My mother went to a normal school ? a teacher?s college. She never got a
                    degree. She had some kind of associate degree. But that was going summers.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Now while you were there, first place, was Vietnam
                        intruding at all as far as when you talk about when you first arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Let me go back a bit, one other event that hit me more than anything was
                    the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: When I was at Notre Dame. I was in a library and I was going off to a
                    class on Southeast Asian International Relations, and coming out of the library
                    somebody said something about the President being shot, and then I raced over to
                    the chapel in one of the dorms and said some prayers for the President. It?s
                    still painful when you think about that event. And then I went and watched the
                    television and then saw that he was killed. That really impacted me and it still
                    does, to think about those days. Because it was such a driving force to want to
                    serve the Great Republic, and then to have him killed like that. It put me into
                    a funk for some time. I think that got all mixed up with my going to Law School
                    and doing some other things. But anyway, I got back on course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, during all this time, was any significant
                        other developing at that point? A young lady?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I always had various friendships and romantic involvements of one kind or
                    another. But you should remember I was growing up in a culture that taught you
                    did not get intimately involved with people until marriage, which I think was
                    good. Kept me from?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it did often push people into marriage early, I think.
                        But then women were coming out of colleges expecting to get married right
                        away.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well the girl I went with in high school, one of the girls I went with in
                    high school, senior year, she went into being a Maryknoll nun. Ended up going to
                    Taiwan. She went to Taiwan as a nun, met a Jesuit, and he was not ordained. A
                    few years later they both left and got married, had two kids. And it?s very
                    interesting. She and her husband, later on in life, I was in Bangkok at a
                    meeting of the Asian Development Bank and I heard they were out there and got in
                    touch. She and her husband were out there as lay missionaries with their two
                    children. And I?m still in touch and now she and her husband are going back to
                    China as English teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Isn?t that interesting? (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That whole thing reflects the course of history. Both
                        social and international.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Right. But I had in my head I wasn?t going to get married ?till age
                    30.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, the composition of your A-100 course, women,
                        minorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: There were a couple of women. If by minorities you mean, blacks?</p>
                <p>Q: Blacks, Hispanics, Asian?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: No. I don?t think there were any minorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you were there, were you figuring out where you
                        wanted, as you went through this course, were you were figuring out what you
                        wanted to do, were you forced, you had to make a decision about what sort of
                        work you?d be doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: During the A-100 course, well we used to have a softball team, play a lot
                    of games in the evenings after these classes, and dinners and go out with
                    people. For the first time in my life I had a little money in my pocket, you
                    know? And then I got into French language training. There was a gentleman named
                    Fred Day, who was in Personnel. I think they interviewed me at some point. Fred
                    Day was a black man. He had a way of drawing you out. Anyway, I think somehow I
                    might have mentioned that I had this problem I was worried about, the family and
                    my brother. Somehow I ended up being assigned to Montreal, and I think that was
                    because of Fred, to take care of that issue for me. Well that worked out.
                    Because you could still do the family issue as you weren?t too far away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were also being able to work on French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. And so I took French, and got assigned to Montreal. Fred Day was on
                    the school board in Alexandria. And I live in Alexandria now, and I?m active in
                    the Alexandria Democratic Party and local politics. Sometimes I go to St.
                    Joseph?s Church, which is in the African-American community. And I see Fred at
                    church. He remembers me, very nice man, nice to see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I remember they asked me, do you want to be an Ambassador? And I said
                    ?You know, I?m not going to evaluate the success of my career on whether I
                    become Ambassador, I just want to do interesting things and be part of
                    interesting things.? So that was the way I think I dealt with that issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember when they asked my class, you know, how many of
                        you want to be Ambassador, we all raised our hand, but I kept thinking, you
                        know, Consul General in Bermuda seemed great. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, one of President Nixon?s buddies got that job later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, so, your first appointment was up to
                        Montreal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from what, ?65?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I left Washington in December ?65, I remember it was very warm. It was
                    right before Christmas, like 60 degrees. Went home to Pennsylvania for Christmas
                    and then arrived in Montreal on January 3rd, and it was ten below zero when I
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there from ?66 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think I left there in March of ?68.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Richard Hawkins, who was on my oral exam board.</p>
                <p>Q: What was his background, do you know?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: Consul General Hawkins. He was from Pittsburgh. I think he had gone to
                    Yale as an undergraduate. I didn?t know his background within the Foreign
                    Service. But he was a very nice man. I liked him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It was junior officer training program, where you were rotated. You would
                    go through non-immigrant visas for four months, immigrant visas, then political
                    reporting, and then commercial work. So it was like a two-year program and you?d
                    gone through these different sections. I started out in NIVs. We had some good
                    people up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you?re talking about the people at the Consul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, one of the guys there was Ray Seitz, who later on became Ambassador
                    to the UK.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The only career Foreign Service officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Ever to serve as Ambassador to the Court of St. James. I arrived there in
                    January, as I said. Ray showed up in June, and I remember talking to him and
                    thinking this is one smart guy. He was not only smart, but he was really smooth,
                    he knew how to deal with people. You could see this guy was very, very good. Sam
                    Hamrick was up there. Sam later became deputy assistant secretary for African
                    affairs. My immediate boss when I started was Neil Parks, and that was in the
                    Visa section, he was in charge of that area. There was a guy named Harrison
                    Burgess, he was political and economic counselor. We were up on 1558 McGregor
                    Avenue. And it was like an old mansion. And I?ll never forget, NIVs, it was a
                    huge operation, all these people would be coming from all these countries
                    looking to get into the U.S., and they would go there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So essentially. Canadians can go in without a visa. So you
                        were dealing with foreigners.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been quite a challenge, I mean, all sorts
                        of languages and all backgrounds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. I remember, there were a lot of Haitians, who would use Montreal as
                    a place to try and come up and get a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did, what were you doing? You say Haitians, was there
                        pretty rigorous screening, or were you just?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>MULLOY: We had had that training in the State Department, which we all went
                    through the visa criteria. And so, you knew you weren?t supposed to give a guy a
                    non-immigrant Visa if he was going to stay. And so you try and make some
                    judgments about that in your interview with the person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a pretty high refusal rate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think there was, for certain categories. I mean, you know, people were,
                    there would always be people coming in calling on a weekend, you know, they?ve
                    got a sick aunt, somebody?s dying in a hospital. And you know, and you would
                    almost make nationality judgments, you knew who that was going to be. You know
                    it was a ruse. And so you learned all that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much interaction with the political, what was
                        going on politically in Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: That was a very interesting period. It was the time of the so-called
                    ?Quiet Revolution?. I think Jean Lesage was the premier of Quebec. It was when
                    Quebec was getting out from under a guy named Duplessis who had been in charge.
                    He had kind of a one-man rule, which was very dominated, by the church. It was a
                    time when an intellectual awakening was going on in the French-Canadian
                    community, also questioning why they should be part of this larger entity,
                    Canada. And I remember there was a guy named Rene Leveque who was a separatist,
                    he was on the scene. He did not become Premier of Quebec until I had already
                    left. General de Gaulle, the World?s Fair was going on when I was up there, expo
                    ?67, the 100th anniversary of Confederation. And General de Gaulle came. He
                    arrived up at Quebec City and then came down visiting all these small towns on
                    the way to Montreal and then he was supposed to go to Ottawa. And in each town
                    he would say something more provocative about Quebec. And finally he arrives in
                    Montreal and makes a speech at city hall, and then says ?Vive le Quebec libre?
                    which means ?Long live free Quebec?, which was the rallying cry of the
                    separatists. And Lester Pearson, who was the Prime Minister refused to receive
                    him in Ottawa and sent him home. That was very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any feel for getting out, you know, your
                        young student groups and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, yes. I took courses. I took a French course at Montreal University,
                    which was a French university. And then I had a girlfriend over at McGill
                    University. In June of ?66 two friends came up from the United States and I had
                    a car and we drove all around Eastern Canada, we went up around the Gaspe
                    Peninsula and went over to Prince Edward Island and went out to New Brunswick,
                    just to see what was going on and get the flavor of these places. I read about
                    Canada all the time, to get an understanding of what was driving its politics. I
                    didn?t know much about Canada before I was there. I mean, I read a lot of books
                    about Canada. And would watch the news shows, and there were some in French and
                    I would try and watch those in order to help myself learn French. And then the
                    second year I was up there two friends came up and we took a ?You Deliver It?
                    car to California, took a bus up to Vancouver and took a train back across
                    Canada. So I saw most of, all the provinces while I was up there during that two
                    year period. I didn?t get to Newfoundland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel as a Catholic for the rule of the
                        Catholic church in the province of Quebec, because of what happened later,
                        sort of implosion of the Catholic church there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, did you see it playing a different role than say the
                        Catholic church where you grew up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It seemed to be more rigid organization. You remember asking me about
                    Irishness. You remember I went to that Central Catholic high school. I grew up
                    in a parish in which there must have been must a lot of Irish. But I didn?t know
                    that until I went to that Central high school and there were kids from one of
                    these parishes that were Polish. And they said you?re from the Irish parish, I
                    never thought of that before. But I guess, I just felt that the church up in
                    Quebec Province was more rigid and more controlling than I can remember, you
                    know my own experience growing up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you getting from your Canadian friends any
                        feeling if they were Catholic of restiveness as far as the rule of the
                        church?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>MULLOY: It was more, there seemed to be a lot of different currents going on.
                    One, there used to be a lot of demonstrations against the Vietnam War. And I can
                    remember the Consul General asked me, you know, to go out and mix in with the
                    students and wear casual clothes, and I had this nice fur hat that I bought. And
                    you?d be out there and they?d be saying ?Johnson, Assassin? or ?Hey, hey, LBJ,
                    how many kids you kill today?? So that was one thing that was going on, a very
                    strong protest against our involvement in Vietnam. And I remember that night
                    being out there with the demonstrators, and then some guys, people started
                    throwing bricks through the Consulate windows, and then all these police came in
                    on horses and were beating the crowd, and of course I?m in the middle of the
                    crowd. And I skedaddled out of there, of course I lost that beautiful fur hat.
                    But that was one strong element you had going on. Then you had the Quiet
                    Revolution, I think they called it that in Quebec, which was get more to
                    secularism and get from out from under the church and it?s alliance with
                    Duplessis. These people wanted to secularize the society. And then there was
                    also the separatist element of ?Why are we part of this larger entity? They
                    don?t respect us.? I mean, the French Canadiens would tell me that the English
                    used to say to them ?Parlez Blanc,? meaning ?Speak White.? And I was not
                    unsympathetic with the French-Canadians in that regard, maybe because my own
                    culture, the Irish had been kept down, and so you could have your insights, and
                    to say well there are some legitimate issues here going on, and they?re not
                    totally wrong, that they should be getting a larger voice. You know the best
                    areas of town were the English area, nicer homes and all that sort of stuff. And
                    my understanding, and there was always a debate over this, the better jobs in
                    the society were held by the English speaking Canadians even though they were a
                    minority. I guess it was probably 80% of the people in the Quebec province were
                    French-Canadian. And then the English said ?You?ve got this narrow rigid
                    classical education and you?re not fit for these kinds of jobs?, and that whole
                    debate was going on. So there were all these different things, there was
                    Vietnam, there was the secularism, and then there was the issue of taking Quebec
                    out of the Confederation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, you say you had a girlfriend in McGill. Did you find
                        that McGill, was this a bastion of Englishness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It was. I met her when I went to Prince Edward Island. We checked in at
                    what was called the Dalvey Inn, which is a beautiful place. They said, I think
                    it was like fifteen dollars a day. And we went down and had lobsters for dinner!
                    And we thought oh my god, we must have heard them wrong, and we checked, and
                    they said no, fifteen dollars. But I remember she was working there, got her
                    phone number, and when she came back I called her and dated her for a while. She
                    was at McGill. A history major, she went on to get a Ph.D. in the University of
                    London, and she wrote a paper on the role of the Episcopal church, the role of
                    Church of England in keeping up the morale of the British people during World
                    War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that?s interesting. Did you get in the campus and
                        all then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering, was there a different feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Montreal was a French University, quite a different feeling, mood. I
                    could never really get into the culture at Montreal because my French wasn?t
                    good enough. But I did have, as I said, I never dated one woman steadily. And I
                    did later have French-Canadian girlfriends, which gave me some real help. I used
                    to have to do a lot of translating of Le Devoir which was the big French
                    intellectual newspaper, and La Presse, translating articles and sending them
                    into State. And my girlfriends always helped me do that sort of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well was there, at that time, what were, was there as far
                        as you were seeing sort of a fresh intellectual Qu�b�cois intellectual
                        community or something, because in France itself the intellectuals play such
                        a role.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Trudeau was part of that. There was a Cit� Libre or something like that,
                    and there was?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we watching this from Montreal, or was this the city
                        of Quebec, our post there, was that covering the politics more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: We had a post up in Quebec City, and that?s where the Government of
                    Quebec was located. But the intellectual movement was more in Montreal. So we
                    were, well, you got rotational assignments. So when I was in the political area
                    I was reading all these newspapers and trying to report on what I saw going on
                    in terms of the development of separatism. And I remember I sent in a couple
                    reports saying this is moving along, no one seemed to be playing attention, and
                    then after President De Gaulle made that trip I remember suddenly there was a
                    CIA officer who came up to talk with us about what was going on there, you know.
                    It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling sort of within your group there about
                        an independent Quebec?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MULLOY: I think we did not want to get involved and say that we opposed
                    separatism, but I think we all felt that that was not in our interest to have
                    that happen. We all felt that Canada was a good ally, a great friend, and that
                    it would be better if they could accommodate French Canada rather than drive it
                    in a direction where it was going to break off. It was very interesting. I
                    recently read a book by former Governor James Blanchard of Michigan who became
                    the Ambassador to Canada during the first Clinton administration. I knew the
                    Governor from the Hill and he wrote a book called, I think it was ?Inside the
                    Embassy Door?.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I remember it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, and he got very active in trying to head off the separatists in
                    1994. I think that separatism may be over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like it has now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think 1994 was the peak, but I saw it in 1966 as, when you would look
                    at it the French-Canadians were in a tough situation. Earlier they had a much
                    higher birthrate than the English-Canadians. But then their birthrate was
                    falling as part of their rebellion against the church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It?s gone down to practically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And the immigrants coming in were all choosing to go into the English
                    community, nine out of ten. They felt they had to do something to get things the
                    way they wanted to, or else they were going to lose control of the situation. So
                    there was a certain amount of desperateness to get this thing worked out with
                    English Canada before they became minorities or lost influence in their own
                    province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get, people have tried to serve in Ottawa, we?re
                        inundated with ?Oh, you?re such a big country, when you sneeze we catch
                        pneumonia, and it?s like going to bed with an elephant.? And all this stuff,
                        and there?s an element of politicians and people saying to be Canadian is
                        not to be American. But in the French-speaking place there seemed to be a
                        little different, I mean you were getting a different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, Ambassador Butterworth was our Ambassador to Ottawa. We went up
                    there, a couple times. English-Canadians in that era, they were always trying to
                    define themselves, just exactly what they were. And it was clear an important
                    part of their identity was they were non-American. I love the Canadians, I think
                    they?re wonderful people. But it did create kind of an anti-Americanism that was
                    part of being a Canadian. Because we?re rejecting what you are, we?re somehow
                    more civilized, and different. The French-Canadians didn?t have to do that as
                    much, because they had their own culture, and they clearly weren?t Americans,
                    they were something else. And so they didn?t, they didn?t have that. But the
                    thing that the French-Canadians had at that period in history, was I think they
                    were being influenced by the French in France. That?s when I really began to
                    realize that we were off the tracks in Vietnam. When I got up there and start
                    reading what the Canadian, and the French-Canadian press were saying, I began to
                    say Jesus, God, what are we doing? We?re off on a misguided venture. So that was
                    an important thing that was going on up there too because I think they were
                    influenced by the French. Of course the French always thought we were nuts
                    because they had gotten out, and we somehow felt because we were better and
                    technologically superior that we could pull it off where they had failed
                    before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there in ?68 as an unmarried officer, was
                        Vietnam hovering around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Vietnam was hovering, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you would have been a prime candidate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was a prime candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I came down to Washington and was going to be assigned to Vietnam ? to go
                    into CORDS, Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support. And to be
                    out there, winning hearts and minds was I think the way they described it. And
                    so there are two things that were going through my head. One, I didn?t think too
                    much of this effort. Two, this constant worry about my family and my brother,
                    and what if I got killed out there in this thing I don?t believe in? Where does
                    that leave all of them? And so I was in CORDS and I was thinking, it was a tense
                    period, of what to do. Finally I went and talked with somebody in personnel, and
                    I said this really is an impossible situation for me. And somehow or other they
                    took care of me, they moved me out of that, and I got the assignment broken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MULLOY: When the assignment was first broken, I had a lot of guilt. I mean a lot
                    of anguish going on in me at this point, because there were guys going over. And
                    you see it as your patriotic duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn?t easy to back away from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: No. So there was a certain amount of that guilt in your head. But there
                    was also a thought that, I remember I used to think to myself, what if some
                    Vietnam kid, who was like an American patriot trying to free his country, shoots
                    you? Anyway, I didn?t go, and they put me originally in the history office for a
                    couple months. There was an office in State working on the diplomatic history of
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Foreign Relations series, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was there about two months and then there was the Office of Water for
                    Peace, which was attached to the Undersecretary for Economic affairs. And it was
                    mainly dealing with the Middle East, trying to solve the Israeli-Arab problem by
                    building nuclear power plants, and providing more water for people. (Laughter) I
                    was doing those kinds of studies. A good man named Dr. Dean Peterson, who was a
                    Dean of Engineering at Utah State University was in charge. Then the election
                    happened in ?68 and Nixon was elected. And I kept reading the paper about all
                    this stuff about Environment in the Congressional Record. And I remember I wrote
                    a memo saying that we ought to have some kind of office to coordinate
                    international environmental matters. Somehow or other the State Department put
                    together an office like that. And Chris Herter, Jr. came in to head it up. He
                    was a Republican, and his dad had been Secretary of State. And I got assigned to
                    work with him. And he was a wonderful man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from ?68 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: ?71.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?71.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Now, what happened here, was also, I put it in my own head, I?m going to
                    get a law degree. Not because I want to be a lawyer, I want options. I never
                    wanted to be a lawyer, but all my life I did want options. Secondly I saw the
                    guys with power in Washington, a lot of them were lawyers. I said I?m going to
                    get a law degree, and so I applied to Georgetown and GW, got into both,
                    interviewed both, and decided that to go five nights a week at GW. It was a
                    better choice, as it was within walking distance from the State Department. And
                    I started in September of ?68. And I went five nights a week for three years and
                    got a law degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let?s talk a little about, to get a taste of this water
                        for peace and all that. Talk a little about what the plan was and what
                        people were trying to do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: My understanding, I came into the middle of it because they needed a
                    young officer, it was a Johnson initiative to talk about the scarcity of water
                    and how that was important to agricultural development, and that they had some
                    big worldwide conference, and this office came out of that conference. And one
                    of the things that they got very interested in was in the Middle East providing
                    more water with regard to Israel in the Middle East providing more water to
                    Israel and the Arabs. And there was I think some guy named Admiral Strauss who
                    used to be head of the atomic energy agency who was pushing nuclear power as
                    something that could help in that area. And there were feasibility studies going
                    on if that would be something, and this office was coordinating that effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But by late ?68 you moved up to Chris Herter Jr.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, Nixon won in ?68, right? He took office in ?69, so Chris probably
                    rolled in somewhere in ?69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the office fit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Under Chris we were attached to the office of the Secretary with
                    Secretary Rogers and staff. I got very active in the Junior Foreign Service
                    officers club, called JFSOC. Also, Billy Macomber, who was the Undersecretary
                    for Management, put together an effort to try to understand how the Department
                    worked and how to reform it, apparently people believed it was a fudge
                    factory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fudge factory, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Somehow or other because I think I got involved in JFSOC, I got put on
                    one of Macomber?s task forces. There were like thirteen different task forces
                    that looked at the Department from different viewpoints. I got on the task force
                    that looked at the Department from the 7th floor perspective. I think that was
                    because I was attached to this office of Environment with Rogers. Elliot
                    Richardson, who was the Deputy Secretary, was really in charge of that effort
                    from the 7th floor. And that was just a hell of a learning experience, to go
                    around interviewing everybody and be part of this- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>I should say that I started as an eight, even with my Master?s degree. I was 23
                    when I came in. Somehow or other I came in as an eight. A lot of guys came in as
                    sevens who had masters? degrees. I think I was told it was because I was only
                    23. But anyway I got promoted to seven, I think I was a seven when that Vietnam
                    thing happened, and then I missed a promotion. I think I was supposed to get to
                    a six in two years. It took me three years to get to a six, and then I got back
                    on track and I got promoted to a five in two years based on my work with Chris
                    Herter. That was a tough period, let me tell you, that whole Vietnam thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let?s talk a little about JFSOC, because, this is a
                        period, I was just a little bit older so I was a mid-career officer
                        and?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Were you in personnel at that point?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point, yes. And we kind of looked at the JFSOC,
                        these were junior officers going around as the ?60s generation, anybody who
                        was under 30 had been born without original sin. And you were all, and
                        people were paying attention to people under thirty. So there was a lot of
                        power, being young, people would kind of listen to you, because you belonged
                        to somehow this generation, I remember a lady who later became Director
                        General, Genta Hawkins, sort of a bomb thrower. Did you get involved in some
                        of these politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was very active in JFSOC. It used to be a social club. And I knew Bob
                    Maxim, Frank Hodsworth, who later went on to work for Jim Baker, and Norman
                    Achilles. Anyway, we looked at JFSOC as an organization to use to force AFSA to
                    seek recognition as a collective bargaining agent for FSOs. In those days,
                    everything was ?the needs of the service?. And if you wanted an assignment you
                    didn?t have much of a choice, it was all a closed process, and nothing was open
                    about how you appeal, how you apply, it was all done within this apparatus. I
                    didn?t feel comfortable with such a closed system. I did not want to throw my
                    life into an organization that I didn?t know how it was going to treat me. I
                    felt thaFSOs needed a bargaining agent and AFSA should be that agent. And so we
                    spent a lot of time and effort pushing that effort. I think it ultimately did
                    some really good things for the service.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, I mean, were you sort of up against real
                        opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: In the beginning. And then we had some elections in AFSA and got control
                    of that organization. I remember one time there was a big meeting in one of the
                    State Department rooms and there was argument, a debate on whether we should
                    seek this recognition, and it really got to people. I was in the audience, it
                    turned into a shouting match, arguing these points. So it got very, very heated
                    between those who were in the old system and felt it was fine and those who felt
                    there ought to be some more involvement by the professionals in how they were
                    being treated. Remember they began to break the service into cones at that time?
                    Well the managers were in this administrative cone and they didn?t have the
                    interests of the political and econ officers at heart, and they were managing
                    their lives without any input from them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I think there was, particularly on the political and
                        economic side was a younger officers felt an awful lot of dead wood up at
                        the top. These are old guys, they were in their forties and fifties. And the
                        idea is to get rid of them so they could move up fast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, I can remember, another friend of mine in Montreal was StevJohnson,
                    his father was U. Alexis Johnson. Now his father went from like an 07 to an 02
                    in like seven years, because at that time in the early 1950s you had an
                    expanding service. We in the late sixties, were in a shrinking service. And so
                    Steve was an 05 at the age his father was an 01. And all that creates tension,
                    so that there was that whole thing going on when you went into an organization
                    that?s not growing, in fact it?s contracting, people get anxious. I took the
                    FSEE management intern exam at age 21. I could have gone into these other
                    agencies. I could have been promoted a lot quicker, and to see these friends at
                    Law School who did that, and were promoted more quickly and then some of them
                    could convert and transfer to State, it just seemed, this is crazy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the stagnation in the system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And that was, that was part of the process. And then a part of it was, I
                    think the Vietnam thing, where people didn?t think that their elders necessarily
                    had all the wisdom, that they had thought maybe eight years before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in any sort of Vietnam
                        demonstrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I participated in some anti-war demonstrations but did not sign letters

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was going to law school at that time, and I remember, there were
                    student demonstrations and riots. I did go down and participate in some of the
                    anti-war demonstrations, but I didn?t think it was right for a professional guy
                    to be in the Foreign Service and openly protest the policy in terms of writing
                    group letters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your work on this, I think in January,
                        publication came out, Diplomacy for the Seventies. What sort of things were

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: One, in participating in writing that report I met everybody, which was
                    good. Secondly you get a better understanding of some of the problems that older
                    guys were seeing and how the place was managed. You saw the role of the State
                    Department vis a vis the other agencies was also changing. As we were moving
                    into more and more commercial and economic issues, I felt, and I got that
                    understanding that State?s role was less important in these areas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, Treasury and Commerce, and then USTR which was coming on. And so I
                    got that understanding as well. But I love the State Department, I love the
                    Foreign Service, I thought these were wonderful, talented, committed people. But
                    the system wasn?t treating them as well as it should, that was my judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is probably a good place to stop, and
                        we?ll put at the end here so I can play the tape, we know where we were.
                        We?re going to pick this up in 1969 when you moved with Chris Herter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Chris Herter.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: We called it the office of International Environment.</p>

                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we?ll pick that up and we?ll talk about, we haven?t
                        really talked about it at all, what it was, and what you were doing, and the
                        issues and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is the 10th of June, 2002. Pat, we?re in early 1970 when your Water for
                    Peace office was absorbed by what became the Office of Environment, or what was
                    it called?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, it was called the Office of International Environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Let me go back and just tell you, the Office of Water for Peace, I found
                    some information in a file regarding the full scope of what we were doing in
                    that office. We were developing water resource agreements with Libya, and also
                    with Israel in terms of using perhaps an atomic energy plant to de-salt water
                    and purify water, because that was a key commodity up there. My main
                    recollection was there was a political guy named Dean Peterson who was in charge
                    of that office, he was a good man, he was an engineer, and what we were trying
                    to do there was try to figure out how to use the other agencies of the United
                    States government to help in some of these larger environmental problems that
                    were emerging, and I remember at one point we wrote a memo to Nathaniel Samuels,
                    who was I think the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, a memo saying
                    that there was a lot of congressional interest in this environmental issue, and
                    that maybe State ought to think about playing a bigger role in it. The next
                    thing I find is in January of 1970, I?m writing to some dean of the Catholic
                    University Law School, a letter that Chris Herter was coming on board, we?d just
                    gotten a press release that Water for Peace was being absorbed into the new
                    Office of Environmental affairs, and that Chris Herter was going to assume his
                    duties on a full time basis in early February, 1970. And Herter was going to be
                    special assistant to the Secretary of State, and head of this office. It was
                    kind of attached to the office of the Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time, how, the environment was such a major issue
                        these days, how was it then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Interesting, again, in looking back into some files, I have this, where
                    in the January 1970 State of the Union message, President Nixon stated: ?The
                    great question of the ?70s is, shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall
                    we make peace with nature and begin to make reparations to what we have done to
                    our air, to our land, and to our waters?? And then in February of 1970 the
                    President set up this cabinet committee on the environment and then he put State
                    Department in charge of the international part of that cabinet initiative. There
                    was a lot of public interest in this issue in that period of time. EPA had not
                    yet been created.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course part of this was that you were having a
                        counter-cultural movement, which had a very strong environmental protection
                        element to it. I mean, more simple things, you know, back to nature, but in
                        that was some was silly, and some of it was, there was a core there. How
                        about on the international field? Were we monitoring what other countries
                        were doing over there, was there much interest, was there say a Green party
                        in Europe and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: No. My recollection is that the United States began to see this as an
                    issue, I think there was probably a domestic constituency calling for this, and
                    then we looked for an international institution to help us push an agenda. I
                    think another part of it in looking through my papers was clearly the fact that
                    we put men in space and men on the moon, and I remember that picture of the
                    Earth from the Moon where the Earth clearly looked like a very fragile
                    spaceship, and that we were all part of it. I think that touched people, and
                    made an effort to think well we?ve got to find a way to preserve this happy
                    place that we have for ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what were you doing? I mean first of all how did, it
                        was Chris Herter Jr.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Right. His dad was Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his approach, I mean when he came on the board,
                        how did he, how did you evaluate him and what he was after?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Okay, first thing, he was very well politically connected. And he was, we
                    didn?t have the expertise in the State Department to really do environmental
                    things, and we needed to bring in these other agencies like Interior, the
                    Council on Environmental Quality. And so what he did was have Secretary Rogers
                    put together a cabinet-level international environment meeting that was held in
                    the State Department in March of 1970, and Rogers said we?ve got some things
                    coming up, we?ve got a U.N. conference, we?ve got some other issues we?d like to
                    get your help in and try to move a U.S. agenda for. Getting that high-level
                    attention to it was very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And so what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was really kind of Herter?s special assistant. So I got to see
                    everything, and it was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he as an operator within the Department of State?s
                        bureaucracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MULLOY: I think in that period of time he was quite effective because he was seen
                    as having close ties with the leadership, with the political leadership. And
                    when you put in an office like that, there were all kinds of vested interests, I
                    remember IO for example was a little suspicious of what we were up to as was
                    SCI, which was the scientific office of the State Department. But I think
                    because we had the blessing from on high, they worked with us, and we cut out a
                    pretty good role for ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was there from when it was created in January 1970 until January of
                    ?72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the issues, again you were there mainly
                        as a staff assistant, was that your job the whole time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: At one point we put together a working group, for cleaning up the Great
                    Lakes that involved the Governors of the States on our side and the Premiers of
                    the various Provinces on the Canadian side, along with both Federal Governments.
                    And I was the Executive Secretary of the U.S. working group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the air pollution thing coming into the Great Lakes?
                        Oil from coal burning, generators, was that, acid rain and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Here?s what was going on, the Great Lakes were a shared heritage between
                    the United States and Canada. We were putting about 90 percent of the pollution
                    in, the Canadians were putting 10 percent in. It became a very big political
                    issue in Canada to get this handled. Lake Erie was actually dying and it was
                    mainly, it was runoff from phosphate from fertilizing crops, it was oil spills,
                    it was the fact that the cities weren?t treating their sewage. There were a lot
                    of different things that were causing the pollution of the Lakes. And the
                    Canadians made a big political issue out of it. They filed a complaint in the
                    International Joint Commission. And then the Joint Commission made some
                    recommendations in 1969, and then the U.S. government picked up on those and put
                    together an effort to work with the Canadians to clean up the Lakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was, how would you describe, I guess you were sort of
                        sitting in on these meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, I?d write up what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the sitting down level where people were really trying
                        to do, how did you find, say, our governor sort of responding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, what happened, it was the two federal governments that saw it as a
                    problem, and then there was an office, I remember looking at a memo, there was a
                    former governor who was head of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs in the
                    White House. And he was in charge of Federal Governmental relations with the
                    states. And at one point we went over and met with him, and he said you must
                    bring the states into this process, and here?s how to do it. And so we held this
                    big breakfast meeting with representatives of the Governors and they were very
                    interested in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were doing this, how about the Canadian,
                        the Canadian province governors. What are they called?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Premiers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Premiers of the provinces. When you all got together, was
                        it acrimonious, or how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Okay, first off the U.S. side pulled together what it wanted to get, and
                    explained to the Governors and they?re all on board. There was a lot of work
                    being done before we brought in the principals. There was a big conference up in
                    Mackinaw Island in Michigan where you had the Provincial Premiers and the
                    American Governors and also the two federal governments. And it was all worked
                    out, it was pretty much worked out beforehand, and so they were up there to kind
                    of bless this program that was going to be adopted by both governments and then
                    was going to be put into an agreement by the two federal governments. And that
                    was in August ?71, it was a two-year period that took to line this whole thing
                    up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we work, say, with Chicago or Toledo or something
                        like that, you know, Detroit which is dumping this stuff in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, the federal government said, here were quality standards that had
                    to be met, and then you worked with the governors on how to get there, on how to
                    get their cities and states involved, that and they had to commit, and it was
                    like, my understanding was the Federal Government would offer so much money and
                    then the state would match it in terms of implementing the recommendations and
                    getting the stuff cleaned up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, I would imagine?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>MULLOY: When we did the Agreement, I think there was a circular 178 process in
                    the State Department on how to do an agreement that?s not a treaty. And you
                    clearly have to have all of the authority already in place through other laws,
                    and then you put the agreement together. So it wasn?t like we were making a law,
                    we were coordinating all the laws that were in place and putting them in a very
                    defined manner to meet an objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we getting things from industries like Ford or
                        Proctor and Gamble or something like that, coming in and screaming and
                        yelling, you know because these are the factories that are dumping stuff
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: You know, I was looking through again my notes on all this, we were
                    clearly not being lobbied by outsiders in the State Department. Later I went to
                    the Justice Department and actually handled these cases where EPA regulations
                    were regularly challenged by Industry. Companies would challenge the validity of
                    the regulations as to whether they were consistent with what the law was
                    providing. Then there were enforcement actions. But at this stage it was clear
                    there was a pretty strong national consensus that cleaning up the Great Lakes
                    was something we wanted to do, that getting a program in the U.N. to deal with
                    some of these environmental problems, there was an ocean dumping convention to
                    stop people from dumping things in the ocean. All of these, and I didn?t see a
                    lot of lobbying by industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, it got quite scary, there with lake Erie. It was a
                        relatively shallow lake.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: That?s exactly the problem with Lake Erie and why it got more polluted
                    than the others. It wasn?t that it was getting a lot more stuff dumped into it
                    but it didn?t have the capacity to absorb what was being dumped in like Lake
                    Superior, which was the deepest of the lakes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, by the time you left there in ?73?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Let me just tell you, there were a couple things that were going on. This
                    was an amazing period of life for me. I had a very exciting job, Chris Herter
                    was a great boss, took me everywhere, took me to the Cosmos club, the
                    Metropolitan club, introduced me around. I was going to law school five nights a
                    week for three years during this period. I was also very active in the Macomber
                    task forces on making recommendations on how to improve the running of the
                    Department. We were supposed to look at the Department from the 7th floor. In
                    some of our findings, based on our meetings with all kinds of senior people in
                    the Department, we said there was an absence of esprit de corps, there was a
                    strongly hierarchical system strangling creativity, there were feelings of
                    non-participation by persons responsible for given areas and problems. There was
                    a use of efficiency reports and assignment processes to punish dissent. There
                    was a mistrust of the bureaucracy at all levels. I remember reading a book
                    called the Fudge Factory and it became clear from that book and others that we?d
                    read that these efficiency reports were a way of stifling creative thought in
                    the service. We thought it was very important to find some way of dealing with
                    that, because many of the young people at that point felt that that was part of
                    the problem, that we went into Vietnam there wasn?t enough dissent within the
                    system to say God, where were we all headed with this one?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the feeling that many reforms in the State
                        Department, when they come up, they usually seem to be, or some of them seem
                        to be spearheaded by young upcoming political officers, equivalent to the
                        Captain or early Major level and all to get rid of the deadwood at the top.
                        And then a few years later they?re the deadwood at the top and there?s
                        another group coming, and an awful lot of reform is to get rid of people at
                        the top in order to make room.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I went back and looked through some of my files. You remember I told you
                    we got control of the Junior Foreign Service Officers Club, and then used that
                    as an instrument to try and get AFSA to seek recognition under the executive
                    order to bargain for the rights of members of the service. And in this memo of
                    November 1970, I think we were arguing that once you reached a certain level of
                    the service you should not be selected out for time and grade but only for
                    cause, so I don?t think we were headed in that direction. We did feel that, I
                    think there was a sense that maybe we should be like the military, everybody
                    should be able to get to a certain level, like Colonel or something if you did a
                    good job, and then there would be a different process to get up beyond that. But
                    we felt that if a guy got in and spent 6 years and got beyond a certain level
                    then he should be guaranteed a full career, unless it was for cause. I think
                    that was one of the things we strongly recommended. And I found this memo from
                    Macomber. At one point in October 1970 there was a Presidential Executive Order
                    permitting people to seek recognition, and he wanted to remove the Foreign
                    Service from being covered by that Executive Order and went to the White House
                    and others to try and get the Department removed from that. JFSOC wrote to
                    Macomber protesting that and then worked to make that not happen, and it did not
                    happen. We were covered by the Executive Order.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I always felt on this at the time, and one of the
                        motivators at the more senior level there were people there who either had
                        their own money or absorbed the mores of those who did have money, so if you
                        didn?t have money you didn?t talk about not having money, and my feeling was
                        hell, I depend on my salary, and I don?t see any problem in trying to get a
                        little fairer share because the people at the top tended to say, well, don?t
                        worry about that, you know, you had the feeling that they wouldn?t listen,
                        let?s go with a few coupons and get a little business, of course you?ll have
                        to rely on your family funds.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: There were a lot of things that were going on at this point, you had
                    Vietnam going on, which caused part of the counter-cultural movement that you
                    referred to earlier. You had the environmental movement that was a part of all
                    that. And I think that people in the service, at least the young people would
                    look at it and say this institution is too hierarchical and it doesn?t want
                    dissent. And the people were looking for channels. And I knew it was part of the
                    rebellion against the establishment. People wanted to be able to say if I tell
                    the truth about what is going on, I don?t want to have one efficiency report by
                    some guy who doesn?t like me ruin my life. I want some way to be able to counter
                    that and have channels, because I think people felt that was part of the problem
                    in Vietnam. I remember there was a guy named Paul Kattenburg or something like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul Kattenburg was involved in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: And I think he was a non-believer in the policy. And I think he got
                    hammered somewhere along the line, and his career was kind of set off on another
                    track. And young people seeing that say we must find ways that we can tell the
                    truth as we see it and not have our careers sent off the track. And we thought
                    that would serve the American people better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess, way behind all this, way before everybody?s time,
                        was the example of the China hands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: The China hands. I read about that when I was in college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. And I mean, people didn?t forget that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: No. No, that was very clearly in our consciousness at that point. Because
                    that was only fifteen years before.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>Q: For those that are unfamiliar, we had officers that specialized in Chinese
                    training before and during World War II and somewhat afterwards, and they were
                    reporting, it turned out quite accurately, on the weakness of the KMT
                    government, but Chiang was very popular with, the party, the Republican right
                    wing of the party, and McCarthy picked this up and the people who had been
                    reporting honestly?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: There was a General Chennault, and I think he married a Chinese-American
                    woman. She led the Committee One Million which was a lobby in favor of the
                    Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan and against the Communists on the Mainland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they, you know, the China hands were considered
                        sacrifices, and it left a very bad taste, because they left the idea that
                        you better report correctly, politically correctly or you?re not going to
                        move ahead.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this rankled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, it did rankle people. I think people felt, if you?re going to put
                    your career into this organization, and I loved the Foreign Service, you wanted
                    to feel that what you were doing was achieving some higher purpose which was
                    serving the interests of the country and the American people, and that if you
                    couldn?t tell things like you saw them, it would make that whole effort less
                    meaningful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. So you had quite a full plate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I did. That two or three year period was a great period of life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They, by the time you left in ?73, how did you feel sort
                        of the environmental agenda was moving? Particularly from the State
                        Department view, both in the here that was in the bureaucracy and
                        internationally, was it taking hold internationally as an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: First off, in December ?71, I left the Office of Environment and went
                    down to UN Political Affairs. And I was assigned to a group working on the Law
                    of the Sea Conference. And I spent my last year in the State Department working
                    on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be ?73 to ?74.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>MULLOY: No, January ?72 till January ?73. I was in IO/UNP. And working on the
                    preparation for the LOS Conference. And I remember, I went up to the UN for some
                    meetings. This was the effort to deal with, mainly the resources of the seabed,
                    they were getting the technology to be able to exploit that stuff, there was the
                    whole issue of 200 mile economic zones that countries wanted. And so there was
                    an effort to harmonize it, in some kind of International Agreement. It was an
                    interesting period of life. It wasn?t as exciting as the other assignment for me
                    because you were down further in the bureaucracy. When I was working for Chris
                    and really had a great access to all of the agencies around town. So that was my
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were working for Herter, were there
                        embryonic counterparts developing in governments, say, in Europe, Japan,
                        elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I remember, I went to Europe right after, I got out of law school in
                    August 1971. It was a personal trip. I went to Berlin, I went to Bonn, and I
                    went to Ireland and England and Edinburgh, Scotland. And each place I?d go and
                    talk with the political sections and their impressions on what was going on in
                    environment. And then when I came back I wrote a memo to Herter saying that, you
                    know, the Europeans had done a lot better managing their environment up till now
                    than we have. My impression was they did a lot more careful thought about
                    industrial planning and where they were going to put different industries, and
                    that they weren?t as exercised about these issues as we were, and therefore
                    pursuing our own agenda we have to take account of that. The other thing I found
                    a memo was in China. China, we thought was going to be part of the UN Conference
                    on the Human Environment, which took place in June of 1972 in Stockholm. And
                    China we were worried was going to lead the developing countries to be hostile
                    to that effort. The developing countries took the view that you guys, in your
                    industrialization didn?t take care of these issues. Now you?re suddenly
                    developed and you have money and you want to deal with them, but we?re still
                    trying to get rich, we?re trying to get out of poverty, and you want us to take
                    on the additional costs of dealing with the environment? And we were very
                    worried that the Chinese were going to lead the LDC?s in that effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the argument was right on, the problem was that
                        the overall impact didn?t allow for us to say okay, let?s take a century off
                        and go ahead and do it and then run along together.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MULLOY: That was clearly an issue that was going on at that point, and I think
                    it?s still going on now. But there was a lot going on, there was another, you
                    remember Pat Moynihan who became a great Senator, on the Finance Committee. He
                    was in Nixon?s White House at this point, heading up something called the
                    Committee on the Challenges to Modern Society (CCMS). I found this memo, he was
                    at that first interagency meeting in March 1970 that Rogers chaired. He came
                    over to that meeting and was very helpful to Chris Herter in terms of getting
                    the White House to take an active interest in these environmental issues. So
                    there was a lot, it was an interesting period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It?s interesting that Moynihan was quite an intellectual
                        gadfly or whatever you want to call it in the Nixon administration, many
                        people point to the Nixon administration, and say, you know, this guy for
                        all the fact that the liberals hated him was really one of them, and really
                        an awful lot of environmental social things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: President Nixon set up EPA. My memos show he was very interested in
                    trying to use these international organizations, to deal with what was seen as a
                    developing problem. Obviously political reasons were part of it, to get a
                    constituency that was growing and was pretty active in the United States. But he
                    took account of it and tried to move it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did, were the Canadians sniping at us the whole time, and
                        various things, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, they would, my memos reveal that they at one point said that we
                    should divide up the ability of the Great Lakes to absorb pollution, figure out
                    how much they could really take, and then you have to clean up 90 percent of it,
                    and we have to clean up 10 percent of it, because we only put in 1/10th of what
                    you guys do, or 1/9th or whatever it was. 1/10th. And we didn?t like that. But
                    it did get us off the dime, because taking a position like that did reveal that
                    we were the culprit, and that kind of got us moving to say ok we?ve got to
                    respond to this problem. But once we began to respond it looks to me like it was
                    a pretty good working relationship with the Canadians. And the fact that I?d
                    lived in Canada in my first assignment, I had a pretty good sensitivity to their
                    concerns and how they looked at the U.S. I told my children that when I die one
                    of the things I want in my obituary is my role in the Great Lakes Agreement,
                    because I felt good about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, did you find yourself getting a law degree and
                        getting involved in environment and all, was this kind of moving you away
                        from the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, in fact, what I clearly wanted to do, and I find it in the letter,
                    my resignation letter. I mentioned to you before, I had some family
                    responsibilities that led me to think a career being abroad an awful lot of the
                    time was not one that I could do. And so I wanted to get into the Legal
                    Advisor?s office, and continue to work on these environment and law issues.
                    Chris Herter and others worked to make that happen, but it didn?t happen, so at
                    that point I had my law degree. I had taken the Pennsylvania Bar and the DC Bar
                    and passed them and then I began to look for others ways, and I talked with the
                    Justice Department and they offered me a position to be an environmental
                    litigator over there, and even at that point I did not want to leave the State
                    Department, so I worked to get leave without pay so that I could go over to the
                    Justice Department and do that, but still not break my affiliation with the
                    Department. And I got leave without pay from the Department, but then after I
                    was over there, Justice said you can?t do that, you can?t hold down two federal
                    jobs at the same time. And I said, well State doesn?t have any problem with it,
                    but they said ?Well, we do.? And so at that point I submitted a letter of
                    resignation to the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well since these interviews are focused sort of on the
                        international side, you worked for the Department of Justice for how
                        long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: There were two parts of my time in the Justice Department. I worked as a
                    litigator in the Justice Department doing EPA?s litigation until August of 1977.
                    And I had some interesting cases doing EPA?s litigation. I got involved in a
                    case that was in the Supreme Court. Vermont sued New York over the pollution of
                    Lake Champlain in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court appointed a Special
                    Master, and we in the federal government intervened in that case, to look out
                    for federal interests. That was a pretty good experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the final result a cleaner Lake Champlain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think it was, the International Paper Company was located on the New
                    York side of the lake and they had to put in all kinds of pollution control
                    equipment. The issue left over was there was a sludge bed based on the stuff
                    they used to put into the lake on the bottom of the lake, which was leaking
                    nutrients into the lake which fed?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weeds and?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, eutrophication, the dying weeds sucked the oxygen out of the lake
                    and then the fish died. And the question was whether they should remove the
                    sludge bed or not, and after the suit it was decided it should be monitored but
                    probably not pulled out and over time I think it did rectify itself. And so I
                    was an environmental litigator at Justice until August of ?77, somewhere in that
                    period I decided that I wanted to get back into international things, and I
                    figured out how to do that. I decided to try and go to Harvard Law School and
                    get a Master?s degree in international law. And I applied and got in. So in
                    September of ?7I got leave without pay from the Justice Department and took a
                    year off at my own expense and went up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, at Harvard, what was international law? The idea was
                        to serve as a consular officer, the Napoleonic code was something that we
                        kind of learned to live with if you serve in lots of Europe, but what were
                        they teaching at international law, was this trying to reconcile common law
                        vs. Napoleonic law, or was this international law mean something quite
                        different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well no, it was much more practical than that. I took one course called
                    the International Legal Process with Professor Abram Chayes, who was the Legal
                    Advisor in the State Department under President Kennedy. He was a
                    policy-oriented guy. And his casebook was divided up into showing how to use
                    legal institutions to respond to real world problems, like the chicken war with
                    the European community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, you know, the major challenge for Kennedy at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: It gave you a look at what was going on in Europe and how the EU was
                    being created, and the different institutions that were in place to try and
                    manage EU relations. So you were really looking at real world political issues
                    and how legal systems were kind of structured in order to put these political
                    disputes in kind of a structure.</p>
                <p>Q: Well now, you got out of there in what, ?78?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: ?78.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing, were you able to put this to
                        use?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>MULLOY: I wrote my L.L.M. thesis, on the International Energy Agency(IEA). It was
                    created by the consumer governments after the OPEC oil embargo of ?74. That
                    event made us realize that the governments really didn?t know how oil markets
                    were managed. It was all subcontracted out to the seven sisters as the major oil
                    companies were once called. Governments needed their advice on how to deal with
                    oil shortages caused by the OPEC cartel. We needed their advice and they
                    wouldn?t come to meetings with the Governments without having an anti-trust
                    defense. And the Congress wouldn?t give them an anti-trust defense without
                    having the Justice Department monitor these meetings. So I just happened to
                    write a paper on the IEA and then used that paper to get hired by the anti-trust
                    division to be part of their international oil team. Ultimately I got the
                    assignment of going to all these meetings at the IEA in Paris and finding out
                    how oil markets worked.</p>
                <p>You have to remember at this point in the American psyche, when we got hit with
                    those oil embargoes, a lot of people felt that the oil companies were making
                    huge profits and that they were somehow behind all this. Clearly it seemed to me
                    they were not. They lost control of this commodity when OPEC and these
                    governments took it over. A lot of people didn?t want to accept that fact and
                    attacked the oil companies. So they didn?t want to go anywhere near joint
                    meetings on how to manage short supply during an emergency without having an
                    anti-trust defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when you came here, you were what, you sat there and
                        monitored it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: We used to go to these meetings, a lot of them in Paris, but sometimes
                    they would be in Oslo or London or even Tokyo. Our job was to get the agenda
                    beforehand, find out what items were being discussed, and then sit there and
                    monitor them and give a report to Congress every six months on what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a whistle that you blew? (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: We would sometimes say that that appeared to be what you needed. If we
                    did not understand some item on the agenda we told the companies not to discuss
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine, I mean it was all the very careful set of
                        conferences that was, I mean, how about the European companies like Shell
                        and British Petroleum and all, were they at all concerned, or was this our
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>MULLOY: They were very concerned because at one point as part of the Antitrust
                    Division?s international oil investigation they issued a subpoena like demand
                    for documents from those companies. America contends that our anti-trust laws
                    apply abroad. And some of these governments like the U.K. put up blocking
                    statues that prevented their companies from cooperating with our anti-trust
                    investigations. And so yes, those companies were very concerned about the reach
                    of our anti-trust laws. And ultimately later on the EU and Justice department
                    reached a common agreement about how they would handle these anti-trust
                    investigations in each other?s markets, but at that time we didn?t have those
                    agreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have a feeling that the United States in was
                        sort of in advance of the Europeans particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: On anti-trust? Oh, yes. I mean, I think it was Article 85 and 86 of
                    Treaty of Rome, which set up the EC?s anti-trust provisions. But the EC was not
                    as active in enforcing the anti-trust laws as we were, and secondly the EC kind
                    of restricted itself to it?s own market in the enforcement of its anti-trust
                    laws.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It so often happens that what the United States decides to
                        do like enforce no bribery, enforce anti-trust or something, we get howls of
                        protest yet within about four or five years or maybe ten years the rest of
                        the industrial world seems to come along, so I don?t know what the system is
                        that particularly, maybe it?s because we?ve got such a large country and we
                        were concerned about these things or something that once the political
                        system kicks it up, but we seem to be ahead. And despite protests, whatever
                        this is eventually the Europeans and others sort of come along.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, it?s very interesting talking about that because in the new WTO
                    round, the Doha round, there have been discussions on whether the Round should
                    discuss Competition Policy. This is because if you?re trying to get into the
                    other guy?s market and he?s got a cartel operating, it?s a market entry problem.
                    It?s a market access problem. And so that?s what people now are realizing, we?ve
                    got to have some international rules on how to handle these matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I?m not quite sure why our system, I mean it?s not trying
                        to brag or anything but whatever it is it clearly, when we had a drug
                        problem with young people we got it before most other countries did, and now
                        of course they?ve got it, or the people who sell the clothes they wear, we
                        seem to be in this, we seem to be the avant garde of the good and the
                        worst.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MULLOY: A couple reasons I think about that. Being the largest economy, which
                    then gives you the role to play politically in the world, and that happens like
                    when the Edwardian age, I guess the U.K. had that role, they set the styles and
                    the way people wanted to look and behave. And I think we?re at that stage in our
                    own history and we have enormous influence. The other thing I think is our
                    system is more open for thinking and creative thought and pushing ideas forward
                    politically, much more than most other political systems. And therefore I think
                    we have an ability to address future problems more quickly than some of these
                    other countries. Now you mentioned the bribery, well when I went to the Hill,
                    and we?ll talk about that later, I worked for Senator William Proxmire, who
                    wrote the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977. He said ?I can?t control what
                    the British do with their companies. But I want to control what American
                    companies are doing in their behavior abroad, and therefore we?re going to make
                    it a crime to use bribes as a way of getting business.? Now whether that?s
                    always enforced is another issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But now, at one time our people were screaming bloody
                        murder, because they felt, and it was, a constraint on doing business. But
                        now it?s become pretty well accepted, I mean, you don?t pay bribes anymore,
                        you pay commissions and all that but it?s a little more regulated and
                        open.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I didn?t get up there and start working for Senator Proxmire until ?83.
                    But in the 1988 omnibus trade bill there was a provision to try multilateralize
                    the anti-bribery effort. And people had been trying to do that in the UN. And I
                    remember talking with the Senator and saying, because I had had this experience
                    in the State Department, and the OECD, and the UN, I said ?The organization to
                    go to is the OECD. We should charge the administration to go there.? And so he
                    put a provision in the ?88 Trade Bill saying the administration should go to the
                    OECD and get an anti-bribery convention. And under the Clinton administration,
                    they got that Convention, and now State reports to Congress once a year on how
                    it is being implemented. It?ll be a long-term effort, but I do think it?s a
                    building block.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you were with the Department of Justice until
                        ?83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, I was in the Lands Division doing EPA?s litigation until ?77 and
                    then I took that year off to get an L.L.M., and then I was on leave without pay
                    and then came back and got picked up by the Antitrust Division in September of
                    ?78 and then I got this congressional fellowship, political science fellowship
                    in September of ?82.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the Department of Justice, you?d been in
                        the State Department. Were they, as far as bureaucracies and people,
                        different breeds of cat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, absolutely. The culture, when I first went to the Justice Department,
                    we would be having lunch and all the people would be talking about a district
                    court decision, and did you see the 9th Circuit opinion on this? I liked the
                    global political issues much more than the narrow world that we had in the
                    Justice Department. And we were taught that the study of law sharpens the mind
                    by narrowing it and that appeared to me to be the case, you know, Justice
                    lawyers are in a much more narrow world. So it was culture shock for me when I
                    first got over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, when you moved out of the, you moved in
                        anti-trust division, you did that until you got the fellowship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I was in the Antitrust Division from September ?78 ?till September ?82,
                    right, when I got this fellowship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you dealing with any international affairs in that

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, it was in the International Energy Agency, and traveling to these
                    other countries as part of that effort, that was the main thing in the
                    international areas that I dealt with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, did you have counterparts in other

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: With the EU, we used to work with the EU anti-trust officials in our
                    monitoring of the International Energy Agency. Not the individual countries.</p>
                <p>

                <p>MULLOY: Well it, I think it was the European Community.</p>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MULLOY: It did not have the centralization of power that it has now. They still
                    had the idea that you needed unanimous consent among the Council to get things
                    done. They changed that now where they have a weighted voting system in the EU,
                    so even if everybody?s not on board they can still do things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of a missionary, or were you dealing with
                        the converted, the people you were talking to at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well the oil company guys were all converted because they were scared as
                    they clearly realized the liabilities out there. They were good men in terms of
                    they wanted to help the consumer governments know how to deal with oil shortages
                    that might be imposed by OPEC. And they helped put together mechanisms to help
                    do that. The idea with oil is that it is such an important commodity that when
                    there is even a small shortfall the price could be bid up dramatically and then
                    have very detrimental effects on economies, on national economies. So the idea
                    was each IEA member has to build its strategic petroleum reserves to be able to
                    deal with shortfalls, and then you?ve going to have a system that we?re all not
                    out there bidding against one other raising the price when there are oil
                    shortages. Then we all suffer. We must find a way of sharing the available
                    supplies during a period of emergency like this. And that was the sum and
                    substance of what they were trying to do within the IA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any flack when you took this
                        congressional position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: You know, when I left the State Department I wrote in my resignation
                    letter, ?I?m sad in submitting this resignation but I hope at some future time I
                    may resume a foreign affairs career.? And the State Department wrote back to me
                    on February 2, 1973, if you should wish to rejoin the Foreign Service at some
                    future date your application will of course receive every consideration, best
                    wishes.</p>
                <p>My first love was things international. When I went to the Hill, I felt it was
                    very important to understand the Congress, because everybody in the bureaucracy
                    was very aware of the Congress and the power it had. I wanted to get an
                    understanding of that, and I wanted to get back in things international. So that
                    was my aim, to use that year on the Hill to do that. And I saw international
                    trade was becoming an increasing issue that dealt with all aspects of the
                    domestic and foreign economies. So I said that?s the area to try to get into. So
                    under my Fellowship I was supposed to spend half a year on the House side and
                    half on the Senate, and I sought my first assignment with the House Ways and
                    Means Committee because it was the lead trade committee on the House side. And I
                    did get on to the staff of that Committee. And so I spent half a year from,
                    probably November ?82 until April ?83, there and then I went over to the
                    Senate.</p>

                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on the house, ways and means committee, again we?re
                        talking, oh, about cultures. What was your impression of how it
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, Rostenkowski was chairman at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dan Rostenkowski from Chicago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Chicago. He was a congressman from Chicago. It was very interesting. I
                    tried to get on the democratic staff and wasn?t able to, and the republican
                    staff offered me a position, so I was actually working for the republican
                    members of the Ways and Means Committee so I was working for the Minority. But I
                    was up there just trying to understand how the whole system worked. And they
                    were doing some major trade legislation at the period I was up there. I think it
                    was the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Rostenkowski was a very effective chairman.
                    I soon began to see all of the lobbyists, and the role that they play in the
                    process. I still never got a good understanding of the fund-raising that goes
                    on, because I was never involved in that. But you saw all these lobbyists around
                    trying to influence things. But I thought Rostenkowski really ran a tight ship
                    and was able to get pretty much what he wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see while you were there much connection with the
                        State Department economic side or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I?ll tell you the truth, USTR ? they paid attention to. But they were
                    dismissive of the State Department. They felt that State had too much myopia in
                    terms of the foreign interests rather than U.S. interests. Of course I now see
                    USTR focused on U.S. corporate interests not necessarily our larger national
                    interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved over to the Senate side.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>MULLOY: You had to find your own assignments, so I went over and interviewed. I
                    had an offer from Senator Bentsen to work on his staff and I had an offer to
                    work on the Foreign Relations Committee staff with Senator Pell. I wanted to go
                    to the Finance Committee as it was the leading trade committee in the Senate. I
                    tried to get on that staff and wasn?t able to. I went to the Banking Committee,
                    and there was a man named Lindy Marinaccio who was the chief democratic council.
                    Lindy said ?You come with us, we?ll bring you into everything. And we have great
                    international jurisdiction, we have the Export Administration Act, we have
                    exchange rates, we have the Export/Import Bank, we have the Foreign Corrupt
                    Practices act, we have a lot of international work going on, and we?ll bring you
                    into it all.?? So I said ok. And he said something else. He said ?If you come
                    with us you may be coming to the right place at the right time.? So I said okay,
                    I?m with you guys. And within a couple weeks I was on the floor helping the
                    chairman manage the IMF recapitalization bill of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find, was the Senate a different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, the Senate is a much different animal than the House. The Senate is a
                    much more collegial organization. What struck me on the House side, and I think
                    we see some of this now, the Democrats who were in the majority were
                    contemptuous of the Republicans and you did not share what was going on. They
                    decided what they were going to do and did it. The House is an institution
                    that?s structured with the Rules Committee, that you could do that. In the
                    Senate, any one Senator can tie up things because the Senate rules require
                    unanimous consent for many matters. Secondly there?s open debate on the Senate
                    floor and any Senator can offer any amendment. So you want to work with people
                    and bring them on board with what you?re doing rather than cut them out of the
                    process. I liked the Senate. I was more comfortable in that kind of
                    institution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were bringing something to the
                        Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, let me give you an example. I was on the floor in June of 1983 when
                    the IMF bill was being debated on the floor. The Staff Director Ken McLean and I
                    were there on the floor with Senator Proxmire who was managing the bill for the
                    Democrats. Senator Heinz was managing it for the Republicans. The managers of
                    the bill sit down in front, and then their staff had two chairs next to them. So
                    Senator Helms came and offered an amendment that said ?No IMF money for any
                    country that is not a democracy.? Senator Proxmire turned to me and he said
                    ?Mulloy, you were in the State Department, how many democracies are in the
                    world?? I thought we were having a private chat. And I sai?Senator, I don?t
                    think there are more than twenty-five.? Two seconds later he was on his feet
                    saying that he opposes the Helms amendment because there were only twenty-five
                    democracies in the world. I thought oh my god, what have I done? (Laughter) And
                    so I ran out and got on this phone and called the State Department and asked
                    someone whether I was right or completely off the mark. Do we have to go back
                    and correct the Congressional Record? Someone told me no, you?re in the
                    ballpark, and I felt much more relieved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because once you start interpreting views you can bring it
                        down to almost anything you want.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: That episode clearly meant that you?re in a different organization here.
                    People aren?t researching everything before they say it. You know when you?re a
                    lawyer and you?re filing briefs, and State when you?re doing memos you
                    double-check everything before you say it. On the Hill it was a different
                    atmosphere, and I loved it, I thought god, this is fun up here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move on to what you did after this, just to go
                        back to Justice and your dealing with litigating on it, did you notice a
                        change when the?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, I was in Justice during the Saturday Night Massacre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I was going to ask you about that and also the change
                        when the Carter administration came in and then the Reagan administration
                        came in, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MULLOY: When I came in to Justice, President Nixon was president. Mitchell was
                    still Attorney General. He left shortly after I got there. My first Assistant
                    Attorney General was a political guy from out west somewhere. After Mitchell
                    left there was a reception for his successor Richard Kleindeinst. I went up to
                    him and said, ?I know before you came to Washington you were very active in
                    politics. Do you plan to go back to Arizona and run for office when you finish
                    your job as Attorney General?? This is a true story, he looked at me and he said
                    ?If I can keep my ass out of jail, I?ll probably stay here in Washington.?
                    (Laughter) And I thought what have I got into over here? Then at one point my
                    boss in the Lands Division was a guy named Wally Johnson who had worked with
                    John Dean?s staff in the White House. He was our assistant attorney general for
                    environments. I?ll go back and tell you, I was actually in the Department
                    working on a brief on Saturday night in October ?73, because the next day I was
                    leaving for Russia as part of an American Bar Association group to go to Russia.
                    And I got there and all of a sudden all this turmoil was going on the courtyard,
                    the courtyard?s in the middle of the Justice Department. And I went out to see
                    what was going on. Elliott Richardson and Ruckleshaus were driving out and the
                    press was all over them, and they had just been fired. It was the Saturday night
                    massacre. And then the next day I went off to Russia. But the amazing thing that
                    was going on, when we got to Russia, we were supposed to land in Moscow, we
                    landed, couldn?t get off the place, went over to Leningrad, couldn?t get off the
                    plane, came back to Moscow, and finally got off the plane but nobody knew what
                    was going on. At that same period the Yom Kippur war had happened. And we had
                    our forces on red alert, and the Russians set their forces on alert, and so
                    there was a lot going on in that October of ?73 period. I was thinking when I
                    was in Moscow I?m going to get killed by my own country?s nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when the Reagan group, Reagan became President.
                        This was in January?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: ?81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?81. Well, in Justice was there much effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: We had a new Assistant Attorney General named Baxter who was very
                    interested in the AT&amp;T case. He got very interested in trying to get that
                    case settled. I think he got a pretty decent settlement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling when the Reagan administration came
                        in, what you were getting at your level, oh boy things were going to change,
                        we?re going to take a different cast in that, or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I did not get any strong feeling at my level.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that?s a good answer, because you know I mean, the
                        ARA bureau of the Department of State had really felt it. But other places
                        didn?t, you know there was a lot at stake, giving Nicaragua to South
                        America. Well then, let?s move ahead to, after you finish this time as a
                        fellowship, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Then, the guy who said I might be coming to the right place at the right
                    time, Lindy Marinaccio, he got an appointment to the SEC as a Commissioner. And
                    so that left the General Council position open. Senator Proxmire called me down
                    to his office and said,?? Would you be interested in staying here rather than
                    going back to the Justice Department?? I was very interested in doing that. So I
                    resigned from the Justice Department and threw my lot in with Senator Proxmire,
                    who was then the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee. The Republicans
                    were in control of the Senate, we were in the minority. Proxmire was a wonderful
                    man. Very good senator, and a good human being. He was the best boss I?d had
                    since Chris Herter. You just felt energized because he was a man who, if you
                    came up with good ideas, he?s going to try to implement them. So it was fun. And
                    then he became chairman in ?87, Jake Garn was chairman of the committee when I
                    arrived there as a fellow in 1983. The committee actually hired me in June of
                    1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you moved in ?84, and how long did you stay
                        with the Senate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I left the Senate in May of ?98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find when the Democrats took over, did this make
                        much difference, or was this sort of collegial atmosphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Each committee on the Hill had a different culture. Judiciary is a much
                    more partisan committee because the issues with which they?re dealing can be
                    quite partisan. You get into gun control, you get into abortion, you get into
                    all those kinds of issues. The Banking Committee at that point was a very
                    bipartisan committee. It didn?t mean that there weren?t differences. They often
                    broke down to big states vs. small states or guys with more ties to Wall Street
                    or more ties to the banks, or more ties to the insurance industry. Those were
                    the types of disputes that would come up on the Banking Committee, so it was not
                    a partisan Committee. It was a pretty good place to work. I had ties on both
                    sides of the aisle. Republican senators after a while look on you as a
                    professional who knows his stuff and can help them. They would send their staff
                    over to seek advice. I tried to be helpful to both sides, but clearly I was a
                    Democrat and worked to achieve the agendas of the Chairmen or ranking members
                    for whom I worked. But we always tried to be very forthright as to how we
                    treated members and staff of the other party.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Trade Bills work? What were we trying to get
                        out of it? How did it come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: In the early 1980s, we were beginning to run huge trade deficits, with
                    Japan in particular. This was a new phenomenon in recent American history. I
                    think a lot of it was related to the Reagan economic policy of deficit spending.
                    U.S. interest rates went up, foreign capital flowed in, drove up the dollar
                    value, but there were all kinds of groups who would be hurt by this. It made
                    imports cheap and exports expensive. Our trade deficits grew. The Democrats
                    became the Senate majority in 1987, and Senator Byrd, the majority leader,
                    sai?What can we do? What can we do to strengthen our trade position
                    internationally? The Senate Finance committee would have loved to have taken on
                    this job. But Byrd said: ?No, I want all the Committees involved, and then I
                    want Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Finance Committee Chairman, to be in charge of a
                    ?Chairman?s Committee,? where both the chairman and the ranking members of all
                    the Senate committees involved in trade will sit in, and each committee has to
                    report what?s it?s doing.? Chairman Proxmire did not like to go to these kinds
                    of meetings, and he sent me, so I would always be sitting on these meetings for
                    the Banking Committee.</p>
                <p>Some Republicans on our Committee and the Reagan Administration wanted to
                    dramatically amend and make less stringent the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
                    which was in the Banking Committee?s jurisdiction. Senator Proxmire resisted
                    that since he authored that law. But we did make some minor changes. We did
                    modify our export controls law. At that time DOD was trying to stop our
                    companies from selling anything that would be helpful to the Russians and
                    Eastern European economies, and the industry was screaming, because the
                    Europeans or somebody else would be selling stuff they felt we should be able to
                    sell. So those become some of the issues we wrestled with. We tried to
                    strengthen and put more money into the Export-Import Bank. We tried to loosen
                    some of the restrictions on building export-trade trading companies. We put in a
                    provision dealing with the international debt crisis. At that time Latin America
                    was being killed by the international debt crisis, so we put in an institution
                    to buy some of this debt at discounted prices from some of those countries. So
                    those were some of the kinds of provisions that we developed in the Banking
                    Committee. The Senate bill also made changes to Section 301 of our trade
                    law.</p>
                <p>Section 301 involves identifying unfair trade practices in the other country?s
                    market and if they don?t respond then you can put sanctions on them and restrict
                    their imports into this country. We put a ?Super 301? to deal with intellectual
                    property rights violations. We put Commerce Department people in the World Bank
                    and the other multinational banks so they could help monitor potential contracts
                    for American companies to bid on.</p>

                        the business community? Did they have input?</hi>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes. Definitely in the export-control area. And of course, DOD would have
                    one view on that, which was, don?t sell anything. Commerce wanted to sell
                    everything and State was often the honest broker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. I talked to people who dealt with trade policy,
                        particularly in this time of the Cold War, saying that as you put it? DOD
                        essentially is: ?Don?t sell anything because it will help the communists.?
                        The Department of Commerce is saying ?For God?s sakes we got to sell and
                        make money.? And state was usually put in the position of finding the
                        compromise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Right. Yes, that?s about right.</p>

                        with about three marines. And they were fire fighters? and they didn?t have
                        anything to fight with and they were just kind of sitting there. The lady
                        was the ambassador to Slovenia. But did you find the states that were acting
                        as a modifying role between some of the government departments and other??
                        Well we didn?t play out that way as far as you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I remember the State Department clearly having a role in the export
                    control area. There were two kinds of export controls ? there were the national
                    security controls, which would control exports to the Soviet bloc. There were
                    also foreign policy controls to countries like Syria or Libya because they
                    sponsored terrorism. State played a big role in the foreign policy controls,
                    less so in the national security controls. DOD would block exports. State and
                    Commerce would appeal to the NSC. A lot of the people in the NSC were State
                    Department people. So they did play that role, but a lot of it was
                    institutionally at that point in the NSC rather than the State Department.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I think President Reagan vetoed that bill and then we passed it over his
                    veto. The Congress passed it over his veto. I began to use ?we? because you get
                    the feeling ?We?, even if only a staffer. That was the other thing. I always had
                    to remember that nobody elected me to do anything. My job was to keep the
                    Senators fully briefed on what I was doing and making sure they were comfortable
                    with it. I wasn?t an elected representative.</p>

                        but it was a horrendous thing and that?s the savings and loan?</hi>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: God, I wish I had gotten my files on this, because this is a fascinating
                    era. I have looked into it because I lectured over at the National Defense
                    University they have a financial services working group. Once a year they put
                    these people through and they?re always interested in this so I have pulled out
                    files on it. I arrived on the committee in ?83. The real problems with the S
                    &amp; Ls came in when inflation hit under President Carter. Due to oil price
                    increases inflation was raging. And then Chairman Volcker came as chairman of
                    the Federal Reserve Board. And he said I?m going to break the back of this
                    inflation, and interest rates as you might recall were up 18-19%.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The S &amp; Ls at that point would take in fixed rate deposits and they were able
                    to pay a slightly higher interest rate than banks. So they would take the money,
                    and they would lend it out for home mortgages, just like that famous movie with
                    Jimmy Stewart It?s a Wonderful Life. And then what happened was that inflation
                    hit and they could not get new deposits as people wanted a higher rate of return
                    and could get it in the money market deposits. The S &amp; Ls became
                    decapitalized. They could not pay off depositors. So in the early Reagan years,
                    the question was what do we do with these institutions? Do we shut them down and
                    pay off their depositors? They had no capital. And the decision was, you know,
                    we?ll let them get into more profitable businesses, and make more money doing
                    other things, and that way we don?t have to spend federal funds shutting them
                    down, because it would have been a hit to the budget. The problem was, many of
                    these S &amp; Ls were state chartered and state supervised, particularly in
                    California and Texas, but they were federally insured. These states gave their S
                    &amp; Ls enhanced powers, let them have these enhanced powers, but nobody was
                    supervising them. And they were into windmill farming, they were into commercial
                    building. It was like having a piggy bank for real estate developers. Over a
                    period of time these guys lost more money and you had a bankruptcy problem. And
                    so the hole got deeper and deeper every year. We didn?t really get a clear sense
                    of what was going on until ?87 when Senator Proxmire became Chairman of the
                    Committee. Under Republican control of the Senate there wasn?t as much of an
                    incentive for Republican senators to be looking into this. The majority party in
                    the Senate controls the hearings. When the Democrats became the majority party
                    in 1987 we looked into this S&amp;L problem. We brought in the Reagan
                    administration and said, you know, what are we going to do here? And they said a
                    minimal capitalization of the S &amp; L insurance fund. And we passed that into
                    law. And then we came back and we looked at it again, and the hole was much
                    bigger than they had said. We brought them up and they said, Undersecretary
                    Gould of the Treasury Department said, ?I urge you in the strongest possible
                    terms to avoid any budget busting bailout of SLIC?. I will never forget that. He
                    meant do not appropriate new funds to close down ailing S&amp;Ls. We can deal
                    with it with existing resources. The Reagan administration ended that year and
                    the Republicans got through the election without this becoming a big political
                    issue. And then almost immediately President Bush raised it as a big item that
                    needed to be dealt with immediately. It was very clear when you go back and look
                    at the record. I think it was Secretary Brady came in to office before Reagan
                    left, and later on he said that as soon as he got into office he was planning on
                    how to deal with the S &amp; L problem. But he knew there was a problem there,
                    they did not want it to be an item in the 1988 political debate, and then in
                    1989, President Bush took the attitude that this is a problem I must get behind
                    me as quickly as I can, and he did, he came up with a very good plan. The
                    Committee worked with him and we put a bill through, and in August of 1989 that
                    bill was signed into law. It set up the Resolution Trust Corporation to buy up
                    all this bad debt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now why did the federal government have to do this?</hi>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>MULLOY: It wasn?t bailing out the S &amp; Ls. It was bailing out the depositors
                    who had put their money into the S &amp; Ls. They had insurance, up to a
                    hundred-thousand dollars per deposit, and you had to take care of the
                    depositors, because that was a federal commitment. People often confuse that. It
                    wasn?t to bail out the S &amp; Ls, many of those went down, many people went to
                    jail, but you had to take care of the depositors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We move on, after the omnibus trade bill, on the
                        international side did you get involved in any other legislation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: In the ?88 bill there was a provision that we put into law, which we
                    required the Treasury Department to report annually with an update every six
                    months on international economic policy. We felt this was an area that was being
                    ignored in terms of making trade policy in this country. The value of the
                    dollar, and why it went up and down and whatever, and also whether countries
                    were out there manipulating their exchange rates to gain trade advantages
                    against the United States. So we required the Treasury Department to give us a
                    report and have the Secretary of the Treasury testify every year with an update
                    every six months about who was manipulating their exchange rate to gain trade
                    advantage and what was going on internationally and economically, why the dollar
                    was up or down, etc. And until we lost control of the Committee in ?94, we used
                    to do regular hearings on that, and the Treasury actually identified countries
                    like Taiwan and Korea that manipulated their currencies to gain trade
                    advantages. Actually, our legislation helped the executive branch to be able to
                    go forcefully and deal with those countries to stop these practices or else they
                    got identified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, over the years we have developed two laws, and cadre
                        of people, a much more sophisticated apparatus to deal with trade wars
                        essentially, I mean taking care to make sure other people didn?t gain
                        advantages through various things, this was a corrupt fact, this was by
                        regulation, by ability to respond and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MULLOY: You know trade policy used to be in the State Department before the
                    creation of USTR. The Foreign Commercial Service used to be in the State
                    Department. State was the biggest player in trade negotiations. But the Congress
                    and business interests lost confidence in State. I think there were a number of
                    reasons. One was the political guys would get the better promotions in State
                    rather than people who did trade work, so the culture did not reward it and thus
                    States best people did not do it. Secondly I think congress lost confidence that
                    the State would manage it properly because State people are trained to look at
                    problems from the other fellow?s perspective. But you?re right, we have
                    developed institutions, I?m still not sure that we?re managing the problem the
                    way it needs to be managed. I mean we?re running current account deficits of
                    over 450 billion dollars a year. Now people say, the dollar will at some point
                    come down in value and the system will self-correct. But why should people in
                    manufacturing lose their jobs because other people are bidding up the dollar?s
                    value. That has no relation to the ability of our workers to compete against the
                    guys in the other country in making an item. In the early years after WW II we
                    had fixed exchange rates, remember?</p>

                    currency values.</p>

                <p>MULLOY: Yes, I was actually in Geneva for the meeting at which it was created in
                    December 1993. A couple of the international things that we did on the Banking
                    Committee, there was an issue called BCCI, it was the Bank of Credit and
                    Commerce International, it was a Pakistani Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pakistani bank.</hi>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MULLOY: And they were involved in illegal activities. When that happened, Senator
                    Riegel was then Chairman of the Banking Committee and Senators Kerry and
                    Sarbanes said we must deal with this problem. You remember Clark Clifford got
                    caught in all of that. A lot of people were focusing on what did Clark Clifford
                    know and didn?t know and that. We on the Senate Banking Committee said, you
                    know, we?re not going into that. Our Senators sai?What is the policy here? What
                    does this reveal about the failings of our bank regulations?? And we wrote to
                    the Banking Agencies. And the Federal Reserve ? God bless them, a great
                    bureaucracy by the way ? came back and said the problem here is you have all
                    these States regulating these foreign banks. They weren?t subject to any federal
                    supervision. And the states used these foreign banking licenses as part of their
                    economic development plans, They do not have the ability or the incentive to
                    control money laundering and other bad behavior by foreign banks. And the
                    Federal Reserve said what you ought to do is put us in charge. Then we can
                    determine what foreign banks can come into the country. And we set up an
                    international standard that they had to have comprehensive supervision on a
                    consolidated basis, meaning that somebody?s got to be the main regulator of each
                    foreign bank and know what?s going on in each institution. We passed that into
                    law in 1994. That was a pretty good provision. I was very happy with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Screams of the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Oh, yes, the states?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume particularly some states, this is a piggybank
                        they could raid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Before Congress passed the International Banking Act of 1978, foreign
                    banks could come into the country and were not subject to interstate banking
                    restrictions. In 1978 Congress passed the International Banking Act to make a
                    policy of national treatment, that foreign banks could do what American banks
                    could do, but no more. But the Federal Reserve in 1978 tried to get a provision
                    that they should regulate foreign banks. They couldn?t get it because of
                    opposition by the states. When we had the BCCI problem, it was an opportunity.
                    When you get something like that you grab it and you try and get good policy
                    done quickly, and that?s what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was something you had in your hip pocket, but it
                        wasn?t, you couldn?t do it until, some of you really screwed up big and then

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Then you could do it. I wasn?t there in ?78 so I didn?t have this
                    institutional history, so I didn?t know until after we got into it. The Fed said
                    ?Well, oh, yes, we have a remedy?. That?s the value of these good bureaucracies
                    like the Fed or the State Department because they have these institutional
                    memories. And they came back and we put that through and got it into law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: World Trade Organization, did we play a role in getting it
                        started, did we see it as something we wanted, or did we come in kind of
                        reluctantly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: After World War II, they wanted to create the IMF, the World Bank, and
                    the International Trade Organization. And they got the IMF and they got the
                    World Bank and the International Trade Organization was supposed to have been
                    done about 1948. President Truman tried to get it approved by the Congress and
                    Congress would not approve the International Trade Organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a rather isolationist congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well the fact is, I guess we had a Republican Congress at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of a reaction, I mean, you had people who had
                        been isolationist during, before World War II and they were out to get
                        revenge or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Right, exactly. And they were really suspicious that FDR had abused the
                    executive agreements and so anyway, the ITO got rejected. Now the way that
                    Truman handled that was that he had authority under the Reciprocal Trade
                    Agreements Act to reduce tariffs. So they set up the GATT. It was not an
                    international organization, but it was a forum where countries could get
                    together internationally and agree on tariff rates on a multilateral basis.</p>
                <p>Q: There has to be general agreement on?</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MULLOY: It worked pretty well on tariffs, but in the ?70s and ?80s, people began
                    to realize the problems in trade were no longer tariffs, they were these
                    non-tariff trade barriers, and how to deal with those. The fact was that GATT
                    did not cover agriculture and GATT did not cover services. So in the ?84 Uruguay
                    Round of GATT negotiations we pushed to get agriculture and services covered.
                    Agriculture because we felt the Europeans with their common agricultural policy
                    was creating enormous surpluses in agricultural products. We didn?t expect to
                    sell that much in Europe, but they were driving us out of other markets because
                    of under pricing with their subsidized stuff. So that was the effort and those
                    were two of our key objectives. We on the Banking Committee got involved in this
                    because we said ?You?re dealing with financial services, the Banking Committee?s
                    going to see what?s going on there.? And so we broke into the international
                    process. I remember when we first went to Brussels and Geneva and these
                    meetings, USTR was not too pleased to have us there, and there was a struggle
                    going on between Treasury and USTR. Treasury wanted to be the chief negotiator
                    on financial services. So we did get involved and I was present in Geneva in
                    1993 when the Uruguay round was ending up. And the reason I was present was
                    because one of the key issues was whether financial services was going to be
                    covered by this agreement. We on the Banking Committee did not want it covered
                    because none of the other countries were giving good financial services openings
                    to our firms. And once we were in, we were locking on market open, because you
                    have to give all signatorieMFN. So anything you gave the Europeans we had to
                    give to the Japanese and anybody else, without getting market openings in their
                    markets, which is crazy. And so we were over there to prevent that from being
                    done. Larry Summers was the Undersecretary for International Affairs at the
                    Treasury Department, and he was in Geneva to negotiate this issue. My job was to
                    be present to prevent Larry from including financial services in the final
                    agreement. We organized a lobbying campaign with all the investment banks who
                    didn?t want it in. It was a fun process, very political, just like working a
                    bill in the Congress. It required the same skills. We kept financial services
                    out of the 1993 agreement. It was later included in 1996 after we got better
                    market opening commitments. When the Uruguay round began in 1984, they had no
                    intention of creating a World Trade Organization. Somewhere along the line,
                    about two years before the round was completed, that idea was introduced. So
                    somewhere about two years before the round completed, people began to think we
                    ought to use this occasion to create this organization, because just dealing
                    with tariffs, we?ve going to have an organization to deal with these broader
                    issues of international trade, and that?s kind of how the WTO got off and now
                    it?s running.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including the WTO?</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>MULLOY: And I thought to myself, this is a historical moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really is. How were we viewing European, as the
                        European Union, by the time you ended up there in ?98, how did we view the
                        European Union, from the perspective of the Banking Committee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: You know up until 1994, our banks could not branch inter-state. We were
                    paying close attention to what the Europeans were doing in their Second Banking
                    Directive. They were permitting their banks to branch throughout Europe. And the
                    banks were saying, we?ve got to have this ability to consolidate our home
                    markets. It will help us compete internationally. And we did some hearings, we
                    brought in officials from Deutschebank, the Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank,
                    and we brought in the Bank of Tokyo. We also brought in some of these
                    international groups to say what was going on in their markets, what did they
                    think of it all. So in one way we admired what the Europeans were doing and paid
                    attention to it. During the final night of the WTO negotiations in December 1993
                    the EU wanted to complete the deal but the French would not cave to Hollywood?s
                    demands for more market access, and to get the deal we stopped insisting on
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was the lobbyist for the Hollywood Crowd?
                        Valenti.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes! Jack Valenti! He was over there, and I remember the last night
                    because I was keeping a close watch on the international financial issues. He
                    got called in by Mickey Kantor, our chief negotiator. Kantor said you know, we
                    love you Jack but we can?t get the agreement we want if we insist on getting
                    what you want. We have to throw you over the side. I don?t think he was very
                    happy, but they wanted to get the agreement concluded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the North American? NAFTA</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>MULLOY: The first thing we did was the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. That was
                    done in 1988. There were financial services parts of that Agreement and our
                    Committee wanted to review it. So Majority Leader Byrd said he wanted each
                    committee to look at those portions of the overall agreement that were within
                    its jurisdiction. I was very surprised when the Canadians came out for this,
                    because when I was in Canada, the last thing they wanted to do was to integrate
                    their economy with ours. They were always thinking that they would lose their
                    national identity. And suddenly here we had this U.S.-Canada free trade
                    agreement, and I was very happy that we got it. To tell you what kind of a man
                    William Proxmire was, I played a role in all that, getting our provisions
                    through the Committee, with Proxmire being Chairman of the Committee. President
                    Reagan sent him a signing pen for the agreement, and Proxmire sent a nice letter
                    to me and transmitted the signing pen to me. In a note he said you were involved
                    in U.S.-Canada relations from an early age and I want you to have this pen. I
                    think that was a good agreement between the U.S. and Canada. The next step of
                    course was NAFTA, and I think that was not good. It was the real beginning of
                    the poisoning of support for trade in this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean, because they?re two quite different
                        economies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Right. That was the problem. The Europeans of course, when they were
                    going to bring in a country like Portugal, they insisted that these countries
                    have democratic governments, and they insisted that they come up with a certain
                    standard of living, and they provided subsidies to do all that. Here were we
                    were going to merge our economy with, essentially a third world country with
                    workers making one-eighth of what American workers make. It wasn?t a trade
                    agreement. It was an investment agreement. Our CEOs wanted to be able to go down
                    there and invest and be sure that they could ship their stuff back here. And
                    that?s what happened. And it began the poisoning of support for international
                    trade in this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You, you left in ?98, and was this election motivated or
                        was this personally motivated or?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>MULLOY: No, in ?92 I had helped in the Clinton campaign, those guys were all down
                    in Little Rock and we used to send them stuff, help them develop issues. I was
                    on the transition team in the Treasury Department after the election. You know,
                    to help prepare the briefing books for the new guys who were coming in. I was
                    very interested in trying to come into the Clinton administration at that point.
                    I had my eye on the job as Assistant Secretary for International Affairs at the
                    Treasury Department. When Larry Summers got the Undersecretary job, Larry has
                    such a vast array of acquaintances and friends who were quite competent that I
                    knew he would not select me. They did offer me a job as Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary of Commerce, and I talked with some folks, you know, Senators, and
                    they thought Pat, you ought to just stay here with us and make another run. And
                    so I did, and I was happy I did because we got the Interstate Banking Bill done
                    in 1994 and we got that Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act done that year
                    as well. But then in ?96 I helped in the campaign again, and Senators Sarbanes,
                    Dodd, Bryan, Daschle and others supported me and the White House appointed me to
                    be an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Well, one, it was fun going through the process, I was confirmed through
                    the Finance Committee. I had my hearing, and I had Chairman D?Amato, who was
                    then Chairman of the Banking Committee on one side, and Senator Sarbanes, the
                    Ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee on my other side. This said to the
                    Finance Committee, this is a guy that works well with both parties, which sent a
                    message to get him through, and I got through pretty quickly. And then, rather
                    than have my swearing in down in the Commerce Department, I insisted that we do
                    it on the Hill in the Banking Committee, because I said we?re going to work with
                    the Congress. And so I did, I had my swearing in, Secretary Daly came up there,
                    and Senator Sarbanes was the master of ceremonies and Senators Dodd, Reid and
                    Breaux came by. It was clearly a very high point in my own life to have
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>

                <p>MULLOY: You make a speech in front of your friends and colleagues. It meant a lot
                    to me because I?d always been a public policy guy and this was kind of a
                    recognition that you?d done something useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Culture of the Commerce Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>MULLOY: That was a little different. I remember getting down there, and if I?d
                    gone back to State, I knew the culture, it would have been a little different. I
                    didn?t really know the culture of Commerce. I remember being in these huge
                    halls, and on the Hill, when Congress was in session, there were just pulses of
                    energy going through the building, and then being down there in Commerce, you
                    didn?t find that. But I learned great respect for the Commerce Department and
                    the people they have there. But when I first got there I began to think what
                    have I done? But then once you get thrown into the work, and all these things
                    are coming at you, you have to sign or move it forward you don?t have a lot of
                    free time to be thinking about your raison d?etre, and you are just trying to
                    keep up with the job. The International Trade Administration is in the Commerce
                    Department. They have an Undersecretary. Stu Eizenstat had had that job, and
                    then Stu got the job as Undersecretary for Economic Affairs in the State
                    Department. David Aaron came back from our Ambassador to the OECD, he was our
                    Undersecretary. So I worked directly with David. David was a young FSO when I
                    was a young FSO, and when I went through my files, I found he used to run
                    something called the Open Forum Panel. So I had known David through the years. I
                    was one of four Assistant Secretaries. I was the Assistant Secretary for Market
                    Access and Compliance, which used to be called International Economic Policy. We
                    had the Foreign Commercial Service, run by an Assistant Secretary. We had Trade
                    Development, run by an Assistant Secretary. Now they were the industry experts ?
                    your e-commerce experts, your computer experts, your aerospace experts. Then we
                    had the Import Administration, which administered our anti-dumping laws. I had
                    all the country experts, so I had a little miniature State Department under my
                    supervision. And the culture we were trying to inculcate there is that it is our
                    job is to be the junkyard dogs fighting to make sure we get what we bargained
                    for in these international trade agreements. You know, we don?t make nice, we?re
                    the mean guys, you know, we bargained for this, you better deliver. So that was
                    the role I had at the Commerce Department. And my main realization was, ITA got
                    a combined budget, but each unit got a separate line. Import Administration,
                    they had the dumping trade bar interested in what they did. You know all the
                    guys that do the anti-dumping cases, so they make sure that I.A. got the money
                    they needed. Trade Development had all the industry people interested so they
                    got their money. The Foreign Commercial Service had built their own
                    constituency, and they actually, at one point, they had these district export
                    offices, you know, that tied them into the network of trade promotion around the
                    country. At one point they hired lobbyists to lobby for FCS and their budget.
                    And I get in there and found out ?Nobody gives a damn about Mac?s budget.? and
                    as a consequence, my unit was a shrinking organization. And I said ?This is
                    crazy, because Congress wants these trade agreements enforced.? So I really set
                    out over the next couple years to develop relations with the Congress as to what
                    this unit did and why it was important. And I have to admit we got a lot of
                    money. That was one of the big things I think I accomplished over there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Foreign Commercial Service, first place, by the
                        time you had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I didn?t have the Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh. But did you find the Foreign Commercial Service, which
                        is generally though of as pushing American trade, and I would think being
                        the mean guy on the block and looking about how countries are not complying
                        with it would be something they?d rather not have to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: Yes, I think that there?s a certain culture. At one point, you know,
                    because MAC could not get funded, Commerce was thinking of merging MAC with the
                    Foreign Commercial Service. It would be a bit like a little State Department,
                    you have the jobs here and jobs out in the field. Maybe that does make sense,
                    but part of the problem in doing that is that the cultures of the two
                    organizations are quite different. The Foreign Commercial Service is a trade
                    promotion group. And they didn?t conceive of themselves as necessarily being
                    market access people. It was interesting in China and Japan they are market
                    access people. In Latin America, they?re solely trade promotion, mainly because
                    State, I think, doesn?t want them getting into anything else. The other thing I
                    saw was in the EU, it was very important for us to get into the regulatory
                    process at the EU and head off bad things before they were put into directives
                    or regulation. Because I realized it was just like American lawmaking, once you
                    put it into law, it was very difficult to change it. You?ve got to head off bad
                    things before they happen. And that came from, again, my experience on the Hill.
                    When we were going to put a provision in a law, sometime the foreign banks would
                    come to us and say there?s a problem. They would say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often you wouldn?t understand what the problem was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: You?d blow them off. Then they would bring in the EU guys, or their
                    Embassy. You?d pay a little more attention, but maybe you?d blow them off again.
                    Then they?d bring in the Fed and the Treasury. And you?d pay attention and try
                    and take care of it. And I felt that?s what we needed to do in their process. We
                    needed to be more omnipresent. And that was what I conceived of MAC doing,
                    having our guys out there more into the process of developing and heading off
                    bad things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this of course is, you know it takes both skill,
                        diplomatic people, but it also, it?s changing priorities, isn?t it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>MULLOY: You know, your point is well taken. Currently up until like ?94, and I
                    think partially in reaction to NAFTA, people said ?Well, are we enforcing our
                    agreements?? And there was no institution in our government that even had copies
                    of all of the trade agreements and what we were doing with them. And then USTR
                    and Commerce both tried to get the lead on it, and they both created units.
                    USTR?s could not be very big and effective, because their power is staying
                    within the White House. And when they stay within the White House they can?t
                    grow. So it really has to be the Commerce Department that?s going to have to do
                    this kind of grunt work that was my realization. I emphasized this in my efforts
                    to solve our budget problem.</p>
                <p>Q: You left there when?</p>
                <p>MULLOY: On January 20 of 2001 at the end of the Clinton administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you?d left, did you feel we were developing a
                        more responsive instrument or aggressive instrument to get out there like EU
                        and World Trade Organizations and other things, to see that we were, our
                        needs were being met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: I do. In the, my last year there, one, I began to send people up for
                    assignments on the Hill. I remember Senator Dorgan whom I knew pretty well and
                    liked very much. He needed a trade guy, and I sent him a trade guy. He liked
                    what he saw. That guy was very helpful to him. Then when we needed some help, he
                    had a very clear idea we were pretty good people, and then he helped us get
                    money. Senator Byrd and Senator Sarbanes also helped. And then I sent people up
                    to work on the Finance Committee. Grant Aldonis is now the Undersecretary of
                    Commerce for International Trade, used to work on the Finance Committee. My
                    special assistant was a woman named Holly Vineyard. I sent her up to work for
                    Finance for six months. So Finance wrote letters to our appropriators and helped
                    us get the money we needed to build our unit. She?s now special assistant to
                    Grant Aldonis. So getting that kind of broader experience for your folks is
                    very, very important to make them effective and not just isolate them in some
                    little part of the Commerce Department. That?s what I was trying to do witMAC,
                    i.e. give our people broader exposure as to what these trade issues really meant
                    to our country. Getting our people on the Hill helped MAC and the Congress. When
                    I arrived at Commerce I found we had only five people on China. We had nobody
                    out in the field in China. The Chinese wanted to get into the WTO in 1999 and we
                    had to give them PNTR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>MULLOY: Permanent Normal Trade Relations, or MFN. I began to meet with China
                    experts around town, how would we enforce this? Part of the key thing was, they
                    don?t have any legal institutions in China. And so, again, we got money out of
                    the Congress to beef up our desks in Washington to put people in the Embassy and
                    the Consulate in Shanghai to work with American companies on the ground. And
                    that was very important. And our current Ambassador out in China went to college
                    with President Bush, and then went into the Air Force and learned Chinese and
                    then became a lawyer. He was in the Foreign Commercial Service in the early part
                    of his career. So he was very happy with that effort. In fact we met with him
                    just last week, and he wants more people out there to work with the business
                    community. Both State and Commerce help them implement this WTO thing. So I felt
                    pretty good about some of the things we accomplished in the Commerce Department.
                    A lot of it was building a sense of what we were about. So we had a contest to
                    come up with a mission statement, and our mission was to ?obtain market access
                    for American firms and workers, and to achieve full compliance by foreign
                    nations with trade agreements that they sign with our country.?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now all this, keep talking about the culture, the culture
                        has changed. Well, you left in 2001, and I take it you feel some of the
                        institutionalization that you put in place has taken root?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MULLOY: The key was money and culture. I do think its taken root. People who were
                    in the Department, the career people, liked me because I was a career guy
                    myself, essentially, even though I was a political appointee I knew the system.
                    I took an interest in trying to get them language training, trying to get them
                    educational training, trying to get them higher grades. My thought was we lose a
                    lot of our good people to USTR, or to other organizations, because we couldn?t
                    promote them. The average grade there was like a twelve, and you could not be a
                    thirteen unless you supervised. I sai?That?s crazy. The institution needs
                    people?s abilities. This hierarchical thing makes no sense.? And so we were
                    trying to get the salary caps off and get people higher grades and keep them so
                    that they don?t leave the institution just when they?re really being effective.
                    And the troops tell me, the guys that are over there, it was very helpful and
                    very effective. I know that Grant Aldonis, who again is essentially a career
                    guy, he was in the Foreign Service. He?s following up and trying to get those
                    promotions and other things. So I think it?s been pretty good for the
                    organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is probably a good place to stop, don?t
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>MULLOY: I do. Let me tell you, when I finished my career and had to resign at the
                    end of the Clinton administration ? that was a hard thing, to feel like your
                    public service career was over. I mean it was everything I?d done. I resigned,
                    went around and talked with some law firms and other places. I had an offer from
                    a firm to go in and make more money than I?d ever made before. But it really
                    didn?t interest me, what they wanted me to do. Then Senator Daschle appointed me
                    to this U.S.-China Commission, where I am now, which is a Commission set up by
                    the Congress to look at the overall trade and investment relationship with China
                    and its impact on our country and to report to Congress once a year. So I got
                    appointed to that, and that?s what I?ve been doing, and it?s a fascinating
                    experience. We?re coming out with our first report in July. And we do hearings
                    like a Congressional Committee and we bring in all the experts. We?ve been out
                    to China and we?ve been to Taiwan. I was just over to Geneva to meet with the
                    WTO officials. So it?s really a way to continue in public service even through
                    formally your career is over. So it?s great.</p>
