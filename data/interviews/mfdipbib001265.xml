                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is October 9, 1992. This is an interview with J.
                        Burke Wilkinson concerning his career with the foreign affairs aspects of
                        the Department of State which is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Before we get into your
                        work, I wonder if you could give me a bit about your background—where, when
                        you were born, your education, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Surely. I was born in New York City, August 24, 1913 and educated at
                    St. George's School and Harvard University. I held a studentship at Cambridge
                    which carried with it a year in John Harvard's Rooms. So I was a Harvard
                    student.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your field at Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: English Literature. I got a magna cum laude and I was a Phi Beta.</p>
                <p>Then I came back and worked as a copywriter...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came back from Cambridge when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: 1936.</p>
                <p>...copywriter for Lord and Thomas. Got a little bored with writing copy and
                    wanted to get into book publishing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lord and Thomas was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was the second biggest advertising company in the world. Now Foote,
                    Cone &amp; Belding.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Then I went to Reynal and Hitchcock, the publishers, and had two years there.
                    That brings us to 1938 when I went to Little Brown &amp; Co. in Boston as
                    advertising manager.</p>
                <p>I left to go into the Navy the fall of 1941, just before Pearl Harbor. I had four
                    years in the Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: By great good fortune I discovered that I spoke a little English so I
                    was sent to the British Admiralty as liaison officer on small submarines,
                    torpedo boats and other sea craft. I stayed there until 1945. I took part in
                    Normandy, had four ships doing harbor clearance and also taking precautions
                    against these submarine attacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the German submarines a major problem during the
                        D-Day time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Again, by great good fortune we were so well patrolled that we didn't
                    have to put in our submarine nets. The enemy never came close. There were small
                    submarines working out of Le Havre—sneak craft—almost suicide craft. But these
                    were caught and did no damage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As liaison were you involved at all in the very first
                        years of the war, with the anti-submarine activities between the British and
                        the Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I really came into it backwards. I was trained in harbor defense.
                    I did a course. I just got interested in these small crafts. I had nothing to do
                    with the major submarines, the responsibility what we called the Tenth Fleet.
                    This all started when I went to England in August, 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the end of the war what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was asked to go back to Little Brown and I decided that I didn't
                    want to. I very quickly wrote a war novel called, “Proceed At will”, based on
                    this small submarine. It was a national best seller and I sold a movie script
                    which never got made. I then quickly did two more novels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you mention them so that we can have them in the
                        record?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: The second one, “Run, Mongoose”, a Jamaican story and the third was
                    “Last Clear Chance”, a Washington-based story. They were recently reissued as a
                    trilogy—”The Adventures of Greffrey Mildmay”. I had a man like Hannay, John
                    Buchan's hero.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Hannay, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: In the meantime, I was called back into the Navy in 1950, the Korean
                    War, to replace Bill Lederer, who wrote “The Ugly American”, as head of the
                    Navy's magazine and Book Section with promotion to Commander, which appealed to
                    me. I had a year and a half doing that. Thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Bill Lederer like? He was a figure of some import
                        later because of the impact of his book, “The Ugly American” on the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Lederer was an absolute brilliant rebel. He had a perfectly good war
                    record. He had a stammer which slightly inhibited him from the Navy point of
                    view. He had a sad accident that hurt his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He ran his battleship on...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was a cruiser. “All The Ships At Sea” tells it in some detail. Then
                    he became a press officer. He went to the Pacific when he brought me in to take
                    his place as head of the Magazine and Book Section. First class, but loved
                    controversy, loved a little bit making fun of his senior officers, pulling their
                    legs—it wasn't a very good thing. He finished up in the Navy, I would guess, in
                    the mid-fifties. He also wrote “A Nation of Sheep,” which is a non-fiction
                    version of “The Ugly American.”</p>
                <p>Anyway, I did a lot of magazine work and a lot of book reviewing. I found that
                    the effort needed with three successful novels a little more security seemed in
                    order. Robinson McIlvaine, whom you have interviewed, was my classmate at
                    Harvard, and begged me to come into the Department. He was working as the deputy
                    to Carl McCardle, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. They had reached a
                    point of no return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was McCardle?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Carl Wesley McCardle was a long time Philadelphia Inquirer reporter,
                    noted for his very clear style. He had become a confidant and friend of Mr.
                    Acheson. Oddly enough he became the same to Mr. Dulles. Both of them found
                    something in McCardle which I discovered too—an extraordinary sort of sixth
                    sense of public affairs and what and the way the news was going to be played and
                    the way things were going to happen. Dulles used this in a very intimate way and
                    moved McCardle up to his old office so that he was the closest man to the
                    Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work? How would Dulles use Mr. McCardle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Basically McCardle was a very shy man and he thought and read. He
                    didn't even go to the morning meetings. For four years I represented the
                    Secretary at the morning meetings so I had a good chance to observe him. If
                    anything was off the track, I would shoot into McCardle and say, “Look, we have
                    trouble,” and he would shoot into the Secretary. Dulles was buying his sixth
                    sense. I will give some examples as we go along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. When did you come into the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I came into the Department in October, 1954, a time when things were
                    settling in. The McCarthy thing was nearing an end. McIlvaine very shortly went
                    into the Foreign Service and I succeeded him as deputy. I came in as special
                    assistant to the Assistant Secretary and then was promoted to deputy. I had two
                    years as special assistant and two years as deputy</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this period progressed, what were you doing? What were
                        your major involvements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I had the historical division; the news division; the public opinion
                    division...we had a man who was testing the popularity of the Secretary; and the
                    public services, which included the speakers bureau called SEV. I had four
                    divisions to run. The other deputy, who was created at that time was Allan
                    Lightner, a careerist who handled foreign policy. It worked very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you go through some of the things you were doing?
                        What was your impression of how Dulles operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I put this in the article which I have given you, my confessions as a
                    ghost writer. Part of my usefulness was drafting congressional statements,
                    messages to foreign dignitaries, speeches for Mr. Dulles. Contrary to public
                    opinion that was spread, he was an extremely good staff man. Watching him at the
                    morning meetings for four years, the staff knew what to bring up and knew what
                    not to bore him. He was impatient and rather difficult, but if you had something
                    important he would go right to it...”See me afterwards” or listen very
                    carefully.</p>
                <p>As I observed it one by one great proconsuls, Livy Merchant, Loy Henderson, Doug
                    MacArthur who was already an admirer, came around to realizing that we were in
                    the presence of a very great Secretary. And Henderson says that at his...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Loy Henderson. Yes. The names you mentioned were
                        really the main stalwarts of running the Foreign Service and foreign policy
                        up through the sixties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: He gave them absolute trust. There were one or two others. There was
                    Jernegan in the Near East and Rubottom in Latin America. These were absolutely
                    first class men, as I saw them. It was a great pleasure to me to be able to say
                    that I was impressed by the brilliance of his staff work.</p>
                <p>One of his special favorites was Nolting. Fritz Nolting was then liaison to the
                    foreign aid program. Dulles had a real admiration for Nolting. I did too, but
                    that is another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Nolting was our man in Vietnam before Lodge. The full story is
                    beginning to come out. Nolting wrote a book, which I helped him with, called
                    “From Trust To Tragedy,” which tells the story. Bill Colby also tells it. The
                    whole question of the jettisoning of Diem, the getting rid of the prime
                    minister. These were the watershed moments of Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the State Department at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I left to go to SHAPE. I was Norstad's Public Affairs Adviser for
                    the following four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the Dulles period, how did you observe the
                        relationship, the formation of foreign policy and the carrying out of Dulles
                        and Eisenhower?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: He was determined not to do Truman and Byrnes. I went on one or two of
                    his trips. He always immediately checked in with the President and said always,
                    “Mr. President, at your leisure with your permission I would like to report in
                    person.” The trust that Eisenhower gave Dulles was absolutely complete. I put
                    them like Acheson and Truman, a much more celebrated relationship, but it was
                    there, no question.</p>
                <p>He was so angry when Dulles was ill. He turned it over to Herter, and went to
                    play golf at Augusta. He introduced Herter to the press in a golf shop. He just
                    simply couldn't face it that he was losing his right-hand man, two months before
                    Dulles died.</p>
                <p>Anyway it was very interesting...Dulles handled Eisenhower perfectly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about this? Are there any examples you can
                        think of? Who was guiding whom? How would a conversation go?</hi>

                <p>WILKINSON: This one little episode in that article I gave you is quite funny. We
                    would send over this first draft...Ike, as we know, only wanted one piece of
                    paper so it was quite a challenge. They were leaving for a summit meeting in
                    Paris, at SHAPE. I think this was 1956. I drafted an arrival statement for Ike,
                    but Ike sent over one from the White House, which was rather unusual. He took it
                    with him in the plane and showed it to Foster. Foster said in his pleasant way,
                    “Mr. President, that was quite a good statement, almost as good as the one we
                    sent over. I wonder who wrote it?” Ike gave his marvelous Ike smile and said, “I
                    did.” That gives you a little clue of the relationship and how well they worked
                    together.</p>
                <p>Thinking back...obviously I lived through the Suez thing. There were many, many
                    problems. If you want to go chronologically we might touch...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we go chronologically. I think this is usually
                        the best way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The first thing that happened when I came on board as assistant, Carl
                    called me in and said, “The Secretary and I are leaving for the Far East in two
                    days and I want you to go through John Paton Davies, Jr.' papers and tell me
                    what to tell the Secretary.” It was a question of whether to have another of
                    those endless hearings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Paton Davies, Jr. was being accused by McCarthy of
                        selling China out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: There was great pressure from the right wing, from the Senator
                    Knowland and company, to try to pin the blame on who lost China. We now know
                    that we did not lose China, the Communists took it. So I took this enormous mass
                    of paper and read every report that Davies had sent back. I was slightly
                    prejudice because I had known him and admired him. I was very impressed with his
                    reporting. It was very harsh predicting the Communist takeover, obviously, but
                    the point was that he was correct. So I did a very short memo to McCardle
                    saying, “Please tell the Secretary not to press these hearings and to put Davies
                    back on active duty. He is an arrogant, difficult, brilliant man, but we cannot
                    afford to lose his judgment.”</p>
                <p>This is absolutely not known and we will have to confirm it later, but Carl
                    McCardle told me after he came back that Dulles had not made the decision but
                    just as he was still thinking about it his telephone rang and Davies asked to be
                    allowed to retire. I think Davies, himself, has never said this. But it is
                    interesting. In other words, he was exhausted by these hearings. He had a family
                    in Peru...running a furniture business in Peru...and he simply, I think, was
                    exhausted. It is nothing against Davies. Dulles had not made the decision.
                    Whether he would have taken my recommendation I just don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came in in 1954. The McCarthy period...we are talking
                        about the China Lobby, etc., strong attacks from the right of the
                        party...what was your impression of how Dulles was reacting to this? Was he
                        buying it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think he knew perfectly well that he had to be careful because of
                    the pressure. Ike said, “I will not get down in the gutter, roll in the gutter
                    with this guy McCarthy.” I think Dulles took his guidance on this one from Ike.
                    We certainly were very careful. He was lambasted for not standing up to McCarthy
                    and he brought McLeod in who was one of that right wing element.</p>
                <p>

                        security.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: By the time I was on board we knew the thing was winnowing out, it was
                    no longer a major issue. Dulles took a lot of flak on his refusal to repudiate
                    in public, but I think he knew.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dwelling on this one, but I think the atmospherics are
                        interesting, he obviously had the support of some of the great mandarins of
                        the Foreign Service...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Or one by one.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you have a feeling that a majority of the Foreign
                        Service was reserved about Dulles mainly because of his unwillingness to
                        basically support them, or at least the feeling that he would not support
                        them during the McCarthy period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The reason I say one by one was the terrible scene which I am afraid
                    McCardle had inspired when he took over and asked for positive loyalty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know in my interviews that statement...positive
                        loyalty in the parking lot in back of the State Department...I never
                        understood.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I used to talk to these people. I said, “Don't you realize that this
                    was simply his own plea. There was no McCarthyism, it was just bad language. He
                    liked these strong phrases, you see, 'positive loyalty.'”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the setting for this please?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Of course I wasn't there. I picked it up the way you did, secondhand.
                    Acheson had said goodbye the day before in the rain, a very moving farewell.
                    This was almost too much and happened in a courtyard. I don't know which
                    courtyard. It just went down very badly. But as I say, part of my continuing job
                    was his relationship with the career. I put in a great deal of time on this.
                    Every speech I wrote I paid a tribute to the careerists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the career of the Foreign
                        Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes. “The shock troops of the Cold War,” was one of my phrases.
                    Another one was “links in the armor of the Free World.” He would fight me a bit
                    and usually take them out and put them back in again. I think the cumulative
                    affect was quite good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he aware that in a way he got off on the wrong foot or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I have never seen a man who I have ever worked for who cared less of
                    what people thought of him. He just went straight ahead. This is obviously my
                    job to flag the sensitivities, you see. But he just simply barreled through with
                    what he thought was right.</p>
                <p>Bob Murphy comes into the picture. Murphy was his political advisor and Murphy
                    never quite came around to admire Dulles. Dulles never came quite around to
                    trusting Murphy. So it was at the highest level. It was rather dangerous. The
                    time was Suez. Dulles sent Murphy to London. He himself was at a funeral in
                    Peru.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Murphy went over and there were conflicting views of his performance.
                    This was at the time of the so-called Users Association. Dulles got over as
                    quickly as he could and took Murphy's place. Some reports are that Murphy
                    flapped very badly. You will have to check that. I wasn't there, but I did see
                    Mr. Dulles before he went over. And then he threw in this thing, which was a
                    “holding operation” the “Users Association” and confused everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a proposal to have the people who use the canal to
                        run it instead of the Egyptians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, that is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel in watching Dulles and the people
                        around him about how he felt about Nasser? This is one of the opinions that
                        somehow there was such antipathy between Nasser and Dulles, a mutual
                        antipathy, that in a way this precipitated part of the crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: In January of 1956, Dulles passed the word to Nasser through the very
                    amiable Egyptian Ambassador here, who we all got along with, that we would not
                    tolerate Egypt buying arms from the Czechs. At that time we were trying to
                    decide whether to help build the Aswan Dam. The warning was passed, by the
                    friendly fashion with which we had dealt with this Egyptian...I saw the
                    transcripts and I knew him slightly. This had simmered and then, what Nasser
                    chose to call the brutal cutoff, we called the Ambassador back in again. And I
                    saw the transcript. Dulles informed him that we had decided not to lend our
                    support to the Aswan Dam because of their continuing to buy arms from the
                    Czechs.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian Ambassador, this is on the record, said, “We quite understand, you
                    gave us fair warning.” This lays the myth of the brutal cutoff. It was 5-6
                    months after the January warning. And Nasser in his brilliant way played this to
                    the public as if there was no warning. As if we had suddenly pulled the rug
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But back to this relationship. I have heard from other
                        people...somebody who was working I think as a very junior officer in your
                        office, Julius Walker...that Dulles seemed to have taken a certain delight
                        at that point in cutting Nasser off. Did you get any feel for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I did not. I thought that he was working straight down the middle of
                    the line. And then time passes because the public affairs officer is only in on
                    certain parts. After Suez was over, one of my jobs was to take visiting
                    newspapermen up to see the Secretary. He was very careful who he saw. This is
                    actually in Henry Brandon's book, exactly as I told...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Brandon's book was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: His reminiscences. It came out last year. I told Brandon this and he
                    put it exactly in the book. This interview was with the former editor of the
                    Times of London, whose name is in that book. I can't remember. Dulles would sit
                    on the sofa and jingle his keys. His opening question of the man from the Times,
                    who was absolutely shaken by it...Dulles said, “Why did you stop?” This was
                    Egypt. They had landed, had the thing in hand and suddenly they pulled the whole
                    French-English expedition off. The former editor stammered...this I can vouch
                    for...and said, “But Mr. Secretary, I thought you made us stop.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eisenhower was saying we wouldn't support this...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: And Dulles in effect said, “You have to remember this in context. The
                    Hungarian Revolt. They had to go up to the U.N. inscribe our horror of the
                    action of the Russians in Hungary and at the same time the English and French
                    were, without our permission, without our clearance, doing the same.” He said,
                    “Don't you understand that we had to? Either that or we sacrifice our whole
                    position in the U.N.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is very interesting. Did you get any feel from watching
                        Dulles or the people around him about how they felt about Nasser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I honestly and truly thought that we were watching very, very
                    carefully. Obviously he was anathema to most people. But whether it affected
                    what had to be done, I just don't know. I was not in on the policy planning.
                    This is the whole question of what public affairs should be included in. I
                    fought endlessly to be included in substantive meetings. Policy planning would
                    come into this. As you know Dulles used Bob Bowie, you may have interviewed
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Dulles had the greatest respect for Bowie. We called him the dart boy.
                    Dulles would fire darts at Bowie for reactions. He was a one-man policy planner.
                    Dulles did not use Policy Planning the way Acheson and Kennan did. It was not
                    really a substantive outfit, but using him...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an idea man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes. He would fly ideas past Bowie and Bowie was absolutely first
                    class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any of the ideas he would bounce off of
                        Bowie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: This would be in the morning meetings. I will have to think back, I
                    did make a few notes. Obviously Suez was one of the tremendous moments. Then
                    there was something in the Gulf of Aqaba after Suez.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Egyptians were talking about closing off the Gulf of
                        Aqaba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I will give you one more example because there again I get back to how
                    public affairs got into it. Mr. Dulles loved backgrounders, in deep secrecy,
                    usually Sunday afternoon. He would get restless over the weekend if he wasn't at
                    Duck Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duck Island being in upstate New York where he went into
                        seclusion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Very happily. He did his own cooking. But if he was home he would call
                    me up and say, “Don't you think we ought to get the boys together?” There was a
                    little group that Phil Graham had which was Ernest Lindley, Maggie Higgins, Mark
                    Childs...this was a top group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Each of these people were top grade newspaper
                        correspondents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: There were several groups. But the one that we called the Lindley
                    group was absolutely first class if he wanted to get something out quietly. So I
                    would say, “Yes, Mr. Secretary.” We would meet at Phil Graham's house.</p>

                <p>WILKINSON: And not much longer for this world. I would remind them of the ground
                    rules...”Don't admit that it ever happened. You could not admit that it ever
                    happened. It was totally off the record.” Now this was the occasion of the Gulf
                    of Aqaba event. And Mr. Dulles reaching into his vast knowledge said, “We may
                    have to invoke the right of innocent passage.” A beautiful phrase. This was
                    kicked around and discussed. This was a well-known legal term. Any lawyer knows
                    the right of innocent passage. Maggie Higgins batted her eyes at the Secretary,
                    who was not completely immune, and said, “Mr. Secretary this is so fascinating.
                    Could we go on the record?” I tried to signal him to remember our ground rules.
                    Looking back I guess I was a little slow on my reaction and he was flattered by
                    Maggie's attention...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a very attractive lady. She was killed in Vietnam,
                        wasn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: She was in Vietnam, but she wasn't killed. She made a great name for
                    courage. She married an Air Force Colonel later. I think she died very
                    recently.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we went on the record, and I was wrong. I should have banged the table as
                    I had earlier in laying down the rules. The following morning his phrase
                    blossomed in print and it was a six-day wonder. Everybody knew immediately that
                    it had been a backgrounder. But we survived it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Dulles'...you mentioned that he saw what he
                        should do and went straight ahead and here you are in public affairs. Again
                        and again it is so evident that if you want to have a successful foreign
                        policy you really have got to keep in mind the mood of the American people
                        or change the mood of the American people. Do you think Dulles was very
                        sensitive to this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think he knew when there was a moment that he had to make a major
                    speech to form opinion and he worked so hard on those speeches. I would do a
                    first draft. He would go to Duck Island for the weekend and scribble on long
                    yellow sheets and come back rested and happy. We would read my draft and he
                    would slap it down and say, “I don't like this.” I learned to take that even
                    though it upset me. He could be very rude, but if he had a point that he wanted
                    to make I would have to think hard...</p>
                <p>There was a major speech in Texas to the American Legion, for instance, which is
                    one of the landmarks. He used the speech if an opinion needed to be helped and
                    formed. This was what McCardle was for, you see...spotting shifts in the public
                    affairs thinking. Basically I would say he was...I take back saying that he went
                    straight ahead...he certainly had a healthy awareness of the importance of
                    moving the public forward, preferably in his own direction, obviously. But I
                    think that was a strong part of it. I will think of an example.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me. Here you are the public affairs advisor. He is
                        going to make a major speech to the American Legion. After all, somebody
                        makes a major speech to the American Legion and the Legionnaires go away and
                        don't even know they have heard a major speech. What did you do to make sure
                        that that speech informed the American people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: This would be what I call building a platform. If he felt a major
                    speech coming on we would look at the various invitations...which he did about
                    one out of a hundred...and we would build a platform. We would let them know
                    that there was a major speech in the offering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would be letting the media know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Sure. And they would be pleased to have the information. But
                    basically...I would have to check that American Legion, I can't remember what
                    the subject was...the technique was very good at having the regional bureaus
                    each put up their part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the European Bureau of the State
                        Department, the Near Eastern Bureau, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Policy Planning would also always have a chance to put in their input.
                    Then my job was to pull these things together, which might run a little long,
                    and put together for him a coherent speech for him to work from. He really put
                    his mark on it, heavy, but effective. “Agonizing reappraisal” was one of the
                    classic phrases. What I call the shotgun phrases. “Right of innocent passage,”
                    and what was the other famous one?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Brinkmanship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Brinkmanship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary Dulles came out with phrases like no other
                        Secretary did. Were these his phrases? Brinkmanship, Agonizing
                        reappraisal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was “To the brink.” It wasn't called brinkmanship
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Let me very quickly tell how this got into the language. This was an
                    interview with Shepley of Life-Time. I again was called in to make the rules
                    before it ever appeared in print they were submitted. Charlie Murphy was with
                    Shepley. I did not sit in on the actual interview. I am not sure whether
                    McCardle did or not. But then Time-Life promised to send the tape, the
                    transcript. His actual words, again “the necessary art,” which is a beautiful
                    phrase itself...the necessary art is getting to the verge and not falling over,
                    not falling into the abyss. He did not use the word “brink” himself. The next
                    voice we heard...they just went ahead with the article and on the front cover of
                    Life magazine was “Three times to the brink without falling in.” Brinkmanship
                    took an instant step into the language. Dulles called Mr. Luce up, I was with
                    him when he called, and said...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Henry Luce who was the publisher of Time-Life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, and Dulles said, “We take great, great exception to what you have
                    done.” What was interesting, they played back the tape and discovered...this was
                    in early days of tape recording...that the machine at the time of these key
                    phrases had broken down and all we had were the notes of Shepley and the memory
                    of whomever had been there. But we do know that brinkmanship was not his word. I
                    don't have any feeling except that it was quite effective and true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in a way it made the situation very vivid. We were
                        getting very close to a major confrontation or war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The idea that Dulles was playing Russian roulette with bombs is what
                    frightened people. I think “the necessary art” is quite a wonderful phrase. I
                    haven't really thought the whole thing through, but this article of mine will
                    give you quite a feel for the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will include the article. Going back again to the very
                        important relationship that came apart on the Suez, what was your impression
                        of chemistry between Dulles and Anthony Eden, at that time the British Prime
                        Minister?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Of course what we have to remember is that Dulles went up to the U.N.
                    to inscribe our horror over Hungary and he was ill. He had his first attack
                    coming back on the plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was cancer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: He simply was...he was missing for quite a time. Herbert Hoover had to
                    take over, the Under Secretary...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Herbert Hoover, Jr.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: ...at a key time. Hoover was a very limited and narrow man, with his
                    bad hearing. He was good on oil and Iran, but absolutely at sea in many things.
                    But basically, you are answering your question. I never heard Dulles on the
                    subject of “Anthony,” he couldn't say “Anthony.” We know that Eden made no
                    attempt to conceal his distaste. I don't think that Mr. Dulles reciprocated it.
                    I don't think that was the kind of way he played the game. He may have had a
                    personal dislike because Eden had been so close to Acheson, the Anglophile
                    Acheson. Certainly the blood wasn't good, but I have nothing to report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how Dulles viewed our
                        relations with the Soviet Union, and particularly Molotov, who was the
                        Foreign Minister during this whole time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think you would have to say that he was the consummate Cold War
                    warrior. It was cold. That was the way he felt about it. It was our ultimate
                    confrontation and challenge. Everything was motivated by that. There were no
                    neutral countries. Being neutral was to be condemned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, again, was one of the things that came across
                        from...I can't think of the exact phrase, but “neutralism is not moral,”
                        which enraged the Indians and others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think that was very unfortunate...this Presbyterian, card-holding
                    Christian view was one of the things that put people off. In that article that I
                    mentioned, taking the word “moral” out of his...he always sent me the speeches
                    in final form even though they were very different from what I had first
                    written. In one the word moral was in nine times. I took it out and he put it
                    back in. That is in the article.</p>
                <p>But basically it was quite interesting to come in in the shadow of Acheson with
                    his great relationship with Truman. I think it had considerable affect on Dulles
                    and Ike. I think Dulles was aware of how well that had worked. He did say to me
                    once, which I find extremely interesting, “I wish I could get through to Dean
                    Acheson more.” Acheson went out of his way to make unfortunate remarks about
                    Dulles, as you know. Again it was antipathy, simply a human reaction to somebody
                    he disliked. And Dulles was very dignified about Acheson. I found that rather
                    touching. Has this come up before?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, not really. Not that relationship. I find that quite
                        interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: See, even in the book that Acheson wrote...”Present At The
                    Creation”...and also the one on the glorious mornings, I forget...in several of
                    them he addresses himself to Dulles. He said that there is no question that his
                    work under me, the Japanese Treaty, was magnificent. Then he quickly qualifies
                    it by saying, “But, of course, he had a small staff and his administrative
                    abilities were not called into question.” (We know that Dulles did a great job
                    on the Japanese Treaty.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He negotiated it under the Truman Administration. It was
                        considered a major treaty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We had a little lunch group with Acheson...the Oxford Cambridge Dinner
                    Committee. I was working for Dulles and Joseph C. Harsh and Lindley loved
                    teasing me about Dulles for Acheson's pleasure. And Acheson would respond to
                    this. I will give you this example. After the signing of the Vienna Treaty,
                    which you may remember was the first backward step...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. This was in 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The great mystery. We never knew why they did it, but they took a
                    backward step. Dulles went to the signing, the great cathedral bells rang out.
                    Joseph C. Harsh piped up, for my benefit, “Dean, isn't it true that you received
                    a telegram from Foster thanking him for your part in making the Viennese Treaty
                    possible?” Acheson in that lovely feathered voice said, “Joe, I am glad you
                    asked me that. It is true that I had a telegram from Foster thanking me for my
                    part.” A pause and then he said, “My part was Sam Reber, who sat in on the
                    original planning, who Foster fired.” This is an example. He was our Minister in
                    Berlin at the time, I think, and was actually a victim of McCarthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for Dulles and what he thought of
                        Molotov?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I just don't know. You see, I was a deputy and did the business that
                    had to be done. He was very, very good with me in a business way. I was
                    enormously impressed with his staff work. And, of course, anything to do with
                    the historical division was rather tricky because he had a great sense of
                    history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk a bit about the history section because the
                        Foreign Relations Series has always been its jewel. How was the history
                        section used when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: It is a point that we should think about because Bernard Noble was the
                    historian. Noble got a Distinguished Service Cross in World War I, state Senator
                    from the state of Washington, just a man of great dignity, and a longtime
                    holdover, so a lot of right wingers were sniping at him. They thought that he
                    was holding back material on Yalta and the China Paper. So there was great
                    pressure. As I remember there was a 20-year rule.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is now a 30-year time limit, but I think it was 20
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: So as we came near these watersheds, Yalta was a particularly
                    important one...1940-1960, you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yalta was 1945. The Yalta Papers came out for some reason
                        about 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We will have to check that because the decision was made to cut a
                    corner. I was sent down to distribute them to the key people on the Foreign
                    Relations Committee, several of whom refused to accept them. I can't remember
                    why, they were looking for trouble, you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The so-called Yalta Agreements referred to a meeting at
                        Yalta of Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill. The idea was that somehow we had
                        sold out Eastern Europe. This was the extreme right wing ideology that if it
                        hadn't been for traitorous action on the part of the State
                        Department...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: When the decision was made to release these early...and the role of
                    Bohlen comes into this...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Charles Bohlen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: ...the first thing that Dulles had to do when he came on board was to
                    go down and testify in Bohlen's favor as Ambassador to Moscow, which he did with
                    great restraint. There was real sharp dislike of Bohlen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand from somebody that when he came back he said,
                        “I never want to be put into that position again.” Of having to defend
                        somebody.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: And he did it because Ike wanted him to. Later Bohlen was brought home
                    and made Ambassador to the Philippines. I helped Chip, who was a friend of mine,
                    draft the press release. He knew that he was being relegated. We made it
                    appear...they were both class 1 posts, there was no demotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still everybody knew...there is no secret about the
                        fact that if you take your leading Soviet expert and put him in the
                        Philippines...he sort of sat there for a while wearing a white suit...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I briefed the press and said, “Of course you have to realize...off the
                    record...that the Philippines are a great listening post for China and
                    Russia...” and they bought it completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have almost bitten off your tongue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Bohlen, who actually was a very colorful and hot-tempered figure...You
                    could tell even in a room with Dulles that blood was bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In connection with the historian's office, did you find
                        that people sort of came at you scrounging around looking for dirt about the
                        Roosevelt-Truman years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, we would have to check a little bit about his staff. In other
                    words, it was a cross section. There may have been people who were feeding
                    material to the Hill, that is where the pressure came from. I remember taking
                    some of the Far East material down to Senator Knowland. He was looking for real
                    trouble. I can see him flipping through these galleys looking for Davies,
                    Service, Chubb...you remember these names?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, these were the China hands who were attacked so
                        strongly by Knowland, who was sometimes known as the Senator from Formosa,
                        although he was Senator from California. He was very much in the hands of
                        what was called in those days, the China Lobby.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: And he was extremely disappointed that he couldn't find materials that
                    they were looking for. And also there was Walter Robertson, who was a very
                    charming man personally. He was the Assistant Secretary for the Far East. For
                    all those years he was absolutely as thick as thieves with that Lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard it said that Walter Robertson, who everybody
                        said was a gentleman of the old southern school, was somehow the rare meat
                        that was tossed to the right wing of the Republican Party. And that Dulles
                        and Eisenhower recognized this and felt this was the concession that they
                        had to make. Did you have that feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Absolutely correct. We called him the little cavalier. He had enormous
                    charm. I knew that I disagreed with him and had to draft some of his speeches
                    although I technically didn't have to do the Assistant Secretaries, I had four
                    speech writers on my staff but he would say, “Oh, Burke I want you to write that
                    speech for me yourself.” And he was hard to resist. The entire time that I was
                    there, four years, Walter Robertson had that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling that Walter Robertson was not
                        quite on the team or was there a pussy footing around him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I don't think so. I think we all knew where he stood and we all took
                    it because Walter had such a persuasive way about him. He held the line whether
                    we agreed with it or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Dulles and China? We are talking about a period
                        when the Chinese civil war is over; the Korean War was over; Chiang Kai-shek
                        and the Nationalists were on Formosa and in the minds of most people who
                        knew about it, thoroughly discredited; there was a new Communist regime in
                        with whom we had no relations; but at the same time there it was
                        representing a quarter of the world's population.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was such an absolutely frozen situation that I can't...except for
                    the report of those old China hands...as you may remember Service was brought
                    back on active duty. This is again a public relations ploy. Maggie Higgins, who
                    I got along with very well, was the only person to interview him in the
                    Northwest area in a remote outlying building with one bulb hanging from the
                    ceiling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in charge of furniture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The shipping of furniture. She wrote it up. Here is a man who is
                    actually just as good as Davies in his reporting. A son of missionaries with a
                    real China background. He was so dignified and handling a menial job. Anyway, we
                    were so frozen on the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a series of crises over the Formosa Straits and
                        the offshore islands then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: We used to brief the Secretary...McCardle did it mostly, but sometimes
                    I was called in...before a press conference. One of the recurring subjects was
                    the Formosa Straits. You may remember that Admiral Carney said, “On my honor we
                    will be at war by the middle of April,” and lost his job as CNO. It was very
                    touch and go and the Secretary handled it so beautifully. And then press would
                    come around and say, “Why won't he say what we are going to do if they invade
                    the Pescadores?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are those offshore islands. Quemoy and Matsu were
                        the two major ones. But the Pescadores were in between, they are another set
                        of islands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: This was Quemoy and Matsu which were almost in sight...was it seven
                    miles?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, sitting, bottling up the harbor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: He said that he would handle this one. Linc White was our great
                    spokesman. Linc and I would sit with the Secretary and go down this shopping
                    list of the things that he was going to be asked. He would never say in advance
                    what we would do. And it was brilliant. The English press, for instance, would
                    be furious. They wanted to know why he wouldn't say. Of course the trick was
                    they didn't know what would happen and we had some very good weapons, as you
                    know, the SAM missile...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sparrow missile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: ...which was capable of shooting down planes by following the heat of
                    the plane. We also had a lot of ships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the Seventh Fleet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Finally, you can check this in the transcript, long after the thing
                    had subsided...and I used to explain to them in private, to the press, how
                    brilliantly I felt he had handled this...but this touched a liberal nerve...why
                    won't he say? How can he do that? It was quite brilliant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are many times that ambiguity is the soul of
                        diplomacy, but, of course, they want to get things spelled out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: And six months after the thing had subsided, May Craig...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was a reporter on the White House beat for years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Absolutely marvelous. She said, “Mr. Secretary, may I ask a question?
                    What do you really think the mainland Chinese thought we would do if they
                    invaded?” And Mr. Dulles gave her a funny little smile and said, “I think they
                    thought that we would fight.” There it is you see. But I thought it was quite
                    interesting. It was so long past, there were other problems. But, “I think they
                    thought we would fight.” I think that is worth remembering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the news media that you dealt
                        with in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think that basically they were edgy about Dulles in a way because he
                    was so bright and he had so many slings and arrows to draw on. They found him
                    very difficult to corner and they weren't quite up to cornering him. The AP was
                    John Hightower, a very decent man. These fellows practically lived in the
                    Department. They were good, honest reporters. The man from Time magazine, I
                    can't remember his name, did a book on Dulles, was very pro Dulles. And there
                    were some others who were pro, but basically the atmosphere was slightly
                    hostile. I would talk to them and say, “Why don't you all stand up when the
                    Secretary comes down?” They just didn't feel like it. They had done it with
                    Acheson, a natural courtesy, but they never did for Dulles.</p>
                <p>Then, sometimes when I had briefed him, I would sit below him...usually
                    McCardle...it was an absolute sacred right to brief the Secretary by the
                    Assistant Secretary. This was the key, you see. McCardle was not terribly well
                    and sometimes he would ask me to brief the Secretary. But basically Linc White
                    would know what the boys wanted to know from sharing, so the advance briefing
                    was mostly what White would produce. But I think they basically had been under
                    the spell of Acheson for so long that there was grudging respect, so grudging
                    they couldn't stand up when he came in. And yet, a curious feeling after he
                    became ill. I heard this, I was in Paris by then. And the British, who really
                    disliked Dulles, you know. There was a cartoon strip...”We trembled at his
                    brinkmanship, we shuddered over Quemoy and Matsu”...and the final little panel
                    said...and there was an empty podium...”we will miss him now that he is gone.”
                    That summed up America as well as Britain. Extraordinary power.</p>
                <p>And one more little episode before I forget it. I was very close to Norstad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is General Lauris Norstad.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: He hired me. His theory was that public affairs should be included in
                    every step of deliberations because there is that ten percent. This was not true
                    in the Department, as you can easily see. But Norstad said that “I want you as
                    Public Affairs Advisor to be in on every meeting, all the planning because of
                    the importance of public opinion.” And this appealed to me and I thought maybe
                    four years was enough. So I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back to one other thing before we move
                        to the NATO bit. Part of your empire included polling, you said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: They had a man, who has recently done a book, I will have to think of
                    his name, who was quite a skillful opinion taker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were getting opinion. Would that funnel through
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Schuvler Foster was his name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the basis of polling would you say something like, “Mr.
                        Secretary, our China policy is not going too well on the West Coast,” or
                        something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: This was started by General Marshall and we called it a “How Am I
                    Doing?” poll. It cost $40,000 a year. The Congressman from Norfolk, whose name
                    escapes me, had it knocked out. I had to testify. Basically it was to ask
                    questions exactly as you say, and it was very helpful. I think it was useful to
                    Dulles. The poll would ask the key questions of the time. I am not very strong
                    on polls, I think it is going to be very dangerous from here on in. And we know
                    examples. I didn't feel that we were checking enough of the people...obviously
                    they had sources. But it was a useful bell ringing, within reason. I don't know
                    how much he used it. But he certainly used it enough to be interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of “I maybe should address this issue because there
                        is disquiet about it,” or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: He would ask Schuvler to include certain questions. It was quite
                    good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on from this fascinating look of the Dulles time, I
                        would like to get a feel, because our program deals with foreign affairs and
                        obviously NATO is certainly part of American foreign affairs...you served
                        with NATO when?</hi>

                        they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Norstad was brilliant and very bold. He became more and more Europe's
                    man, rather than the US. He had two hats. He was the senior American commander
                    in Europe and he was the NATO Supreme Allied Commander. He had a very close
                    relationship with the Council, which was then in Paris, with the 15 countries.
                    There was a Public Affairs Advisor, and a POLAD, a Political Advisor and Doug
                    MacArthur, who you mentioned, I think was the first. Ike created SHAPE. But in
                    my day it was Walter Stoessel and George Vest and Ray Thurston. Thurston first,
                    then Stoessel, and Vest was the deputy. In other words we had a very good link
                    to the State Department, plus myself.</p>
                <p>This job of Public Affairs Advisor was created by Norstad for me. There was a
                    British Brigadier handling the press releases, who bitterly resented my coming
                    on board. I had three stars equivalent rank, so I ranked the Brigadier, but it
                    was very tricky.</p>
                <p>Before we finish Dulles, I want to do one more glimpse. Norstad had never met
                    Dulles and we talked about him a great deal. He wanted to know how I felt about
                    Dulles. When Dulles became finally ill, his last month as Secretary of State, he
                    came over to say goodby to Adenauer with whom he was very, very close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Chancellor of Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: On his way he stopped for a day in London. Dulles asked Norstad to
                    come over, he wanted to be briefed before he saw Adenauer. There were some very
                    important German-English matters quite recently in the military part of detente.
                    So we went over and went to Jock Whitney's residence...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Ambassador to Great Britain at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: ...in deep secrecy, for some reason. It was totally off the record.
                    Norstad and Dulles spent the entire day talking. I was with Brad Connors, who
                    was the Public Affairs Advisor, in a room outside. Sometimes they would call us
                    in on a question...in other words on a point...but basically they had a
                    tremendous exchange.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Going back in the plane Norstad said how magnificent he thought Dulles was, even
                    in his final illness. And in a rather typical Norstad remark that I thought was
                    funny, he said, “But, you know, Burke, he thinks just like me,” which in Norstad
                    lexicon was the highest praise. They were both Cold War warriors, aware of the
                    threat. Norstad, obviously when he first came there, the Russian threat...they
                    thought the Channel ports were in danger of a push across the German plain. We
                    forget that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is what I would like to ask...you were talking
                        about 1958-62...You were sitting in on meetings. Today, of course, there is
                        no longer a Soviet Union, but at the time, what was the reason that we
                        thought the Soviets would try to conquer Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It is a tremendous question, even today. I ask myself this question
                    all the time. Was it true? Did we really think or were we doing this for our own
                    military purposes? Did we really think that this was a danger? Norstad loved to
                    in his speeches, mostly drafted by me, ...he wasn't the drafting officer Dulles
                    was and relied a good deal on materials that we supplied...loved to say that he
                    brought his wife and daughter when he first arrived in 1955, which was the real
                    Cold War. It was reassuring that he brought his family because the fear was so
                    great of a Soviet drive across the plain.</p>
                <p>I must confess to you that by the time that I got there...Germany came in in 1954
                    and the French were fighting it...one of the problems was that it created the
                    European Defense Community, EDC. But there certainly was still a palpable
                    feeling that this was a real threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is still during the time you were there—1958-62?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I believe by the time...he loved to go back to that time...but as I
                    saw it one of the problems was the slowness of the European countries to
                    contribute their part. There was a famous scene after Ike had been there a year,
                    they were still at the hotel in Paris, SHAPE had not come into physical being.
                    Each of the countries reported on their preparedness. As Norstad described it,
                    Ike's face got redder and redder, until he was nearly black with anger and he
                    got up on his feet at the end of the briefing and said, “Gentlemen I expect
                    better of you,” and strolled off. It made a tremendous effect. They hadn't
                    realized the black anger of Eisenhower. In other words, there was real
                    hesitancy...awareness of the threat but also slowness in putting their house in
                    order. Does that answer your question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we are talking under Norstad. Were you always
                        operating during this 1958-62 period more or less under the assumption that
                        the Soviet Army was poised ready to let go, or was there the feeling that
                        you had sort of settled into a feeling of status quo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I think you would have to bring the atomic into this. They
                    acquired the atom in 1954. This was the added threat of an incident escalating
                    and Norstad...I am very glad to get this on the record because in the Kennedy
                    campaign the theory that we were trigger-happy during the Eisenhower time was
                    prevalent. And it simply wasn't true. Norstad's phrase for “raising the
                    threshold” was “creating the pause if something happened, for sanity to step
                    in.” This is completely ignored now. The theory is that all Dulles did was
                    rattle the bomb, with Ike's approval. And Ike having been the military man was
                    able to exert the great power of the atom bomb. Thus Norstad labored endlessly
                    to create the pause, which is the same as Max Taylor's “threshold” of the early
                    sixties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the Berlin Wall crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was there through June, 1962.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did NATO react during that Wall crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Very interesting point that Berlin came under the Four Powers, not
                    technically under SHAPE. But Norstad played a very, very active part in creating
                    the pause. Because it really was touch and go, as you know. Norstad was in daily
                    conversation with our man in Berlin who was flapping a bit, and was thinking of
                    different ways of slowing them. Of getting trains through without an incident.
                    They were dropping tinsel from airplanes to prevent flights which was
                    provocative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The tinsel was called window which blotted out radar.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Norstad had counter-measures...this is totally unknown because he
                    didn't want it known that we were taking a part in it, that we were cutting a
                    corner. But he was so good. He played a considerable role in the cooling off of
                    that very anxious crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the role of the French in
                        NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Here we were the guest of the French government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. France was still in there and de Gaulle was in
                        command.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: And we had had three brilliant Supreme Commanders...one was Dougwell
                    Suitertobe, Ridgeway was number two, more of a troop man...he was in and out
                    within a year, and a wonderful man. Brenth succeeded Ridgeway and was subtle,
                    brilliant, and tactful. Then Norstad.</p>
                <p>Immediately when I reported in, Norstad said, “Part of your work is going to be
                    working with the French.” We had this problem with de Gaulle who would never
                    come to the headquarters. He did not like having foreign troops on French soil.
                    Somehow they diminished...even though they were very important for the security.
                    And he didn't like having naval ships loaned by the US, including a carrier, to
                    the French forces...the Belleau Wood. It just somehow got under his skin.</p>
                <p>We knew that sooner or later there was going to be trouble. It didn't come until
                    several years later...I think it was 1967 when we were kicked out of France.
                    Crazy if you consider the advantage of having the pipelines and the bases. This
                    was not the kind of thing that had any consideration with de Gaulle, you see.
                    And people loved being in France. There were officers even when I was there who
                    were on their sixth tour in France.</p>
                <p>You asked how we worked? We had small staff meetings. Norstad didn't like a big
                    group so there would be three or four at a time. At one of these meetings he
                    started brooding over why de Gaulle would never come to SHAPE for one of our
                    ceremonies. Adenauer, for instance, came often. Kennedy came. Norstad said, “I
                    am going to the Elys�e Palace tonight for dinner, and I am going to tackle him
                    on this subject.” As Public Affairs Advisor I said, “Supreme Commander, I
                    respectfully suggest that you don't bring it up in a public place.” And he said,
                    “Yes, I am going to do it.”</p>
                <p>The next morning, Randolph Kidder, who was at the Embassy and a classmate and
                    friend of mine, called and said, “I happened to be at the dinner and I think you
                    ought to know what happened. Norstad was talking to de Gaulle in the most
                    friendly fashion. They were walking up and down and suddenly de Gaulle turned
                    red, turned on his heels and walked away.” I said, “Randy, thank you very much.”
                    Norstad never brought this up and I never brought it up. This is a good example
                    of a public affairs advisor's role.</p>
                <p>While we are on the subject, the man in Berlin during the Vienna crisis was Sam
                    Reber.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the British contribution to
                        SHAPE?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: This was part of the brilliance of Norstad. We worked very, very
                    closely with the British. Their cabinet would come over. It was a kind of a
                    working formula. If anyone came out to SHAPE they would spend a day and Norstad
                    would arrange the briefings and we would get to know them. Macmillan came and
                    the opposition, Gaitskell came. The British went out of their way to cultivate
                    Norstad and Norstad went out of his way. Field Marshal Montgomery, when I was
                    first there, was the Deputy Supreme Commander and this they liked. There was
                    very good vibrations with the British. I think they had two divisions in
                    Germany, which Norstad went out of his way to be polite about, although their
                    contribution was not very great.</p>
                <p>The fleet was a special unit that reported directly to the NATO ministries. I
                    can't remember now why. There was some tricky set up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Germans? They were still rather new boys on
                        the scene. Most of the people in SHAPE had fought against them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: This is a very interesting point. The Germans, there were 66 officers
                    at SHAPE, sent their absolutely first class men. Oddly enough, talking at lunch
                    they were very much in evidence. They all had fought on the Russian front. If
                    they had fought elsewhere they never mentioned it, it was always the Russian
                    front. The Iron Cross was very much in evidence. They were absolutely first
                    class. They were heart and soul for the Alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you are saying, you found the French problem
                        really was at the top, but how was the relationship with the French
                        military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: You have to remember how the command worked. The central command was
                    in Fontainebleau and there was a French commander...full awareness to French
                    sensibilities. I would say that at the working level relations were pretty good
                    with the military. There were many French divisions in Germany. I can't think of
                    the French commander. It worked very well, and what is very important to
                    remember is that Spaak...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Paul Henri Spaak of Belgium.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: ...was the Secretary General of NATO and an absolutely brilliant man,
                    rather aware of his prerogatives so that he was very careful polite with
                    Norstad. Halfway through he was replaced by a Dutchman, also beginning with S
                    [Stikker] who had an enormous admiration for Norstad. So the thing improved. I
                    can't think who the French representative was. All that I can remember is that
                    it worked very well at the work level, under de Gaulle</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything you think we should cover? You left
                        there in 1962.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes. Another point was part of the Norstad mystique. He insisted that
                    I spend part of my time in the field. He wanted to know what was happening. Part
                    of my job was to move him around because he had to be very visible. If he was
                    going on a trip, being Norwegian by descent he always wanted to go to Norway,
                    and I had to say that he had 14 other countries. But he let me spend a month in
                    Turkey, for instance, with the Turkish forces, or two weeks in Greece with the
                    Greeks, in preparation for his trips. This, I think, was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Greek-Turkish thing? How was that
                        viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: You had to be very careful. I went to both Greece and Turkey,
                    separately. One trip was with the Deputy, the successor to Montgomery, who was a
                    marvelous old general—Sir Richard Gale, who had fought at Gallipoli as a very
                    junior officer. He asked the pilot, we were looking across into Bulgaria,
                    flying, and he said, “Why don't we drop in on Constantinople or Ankara?” The
                    pilot turned a little white and said, “I don't think we could, they will shoot.
                    They wouldn't clear us.” So we didn't go in. It was that bad. The only link that
                    Greece and Turkey did share was NATO. The Turks were very, very proud of being
                    part of NATO.</p>
                <p>For the record, it came out in a new book on the missile crisis, they mention the
                    fact that Norstad took exception to the withdrawing of our missiles as part of
                    the Cuban deal. But I was no longer there, so I can't tell you whether he did.
                    He made a point of going public on this. It sounded a little out of
                    character.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, it does. Because I think the general feeling and what
                        I gather was that Kennedy was annoyed as hell because the missiles were
                        considered obsolete—these were Jupiter missiles in Turkey—and before the
                        Cuban missile crisis started so the idea was to get them out but it was
                        difficult because the Turks had the vehicles but we had the warheads. It
                        just took too long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Very skillfully used by Kennedy to defuse the missile crisis. But I
                    would have to check that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you can add anything you like on this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I want to add we lived the beginnings of Vietnam...and of course I was
                    very remote from SHAPE, but we used to talk about it greatly. A great deal in
                    the morning meetings. After Norstad retired, and I wish you would make a note:
                    Norstad's problem was that he was known throughout as an Eisenhower
                    lieutenant.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a major flyer during World War II.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, he was a box of brains. Ike created SHAPE and came back several
                    times while we were there. I wrote a weekly newsletter to Ike about the Command,
                    at his request. It was a source of his greatest pride, that he had created it. I
                    wrote a letter for Norstad's signature telling him everything that was
                    happening. We were very proud when he came back.</p>
                <p>After Kennedy took over Norstad's role diminished. McNamara, Nitze and Art
                    Sylvester, who was the press officer, came to Paris with Kennedy. And it was
                    very difficult. Kennedy had been briefed to look out for Norstad...brilliant,
                    possible political ambitions. Ike was recruited by Herter and Lodge to be
                    President when he was still Supreme Commander. Norstad remembered that. He
                    wondered if some whistle might blow because he did have political ambition. But
                    it came to nothing because he never met Kennedy until he came. And Norstad,
                    knowing that I was a great Kennedy admirer and had known him pleasantly...we
                    stayed up practically all night talking about Kennedy before he came. Because of
                    his handling of the Berlin Crisis, Kennedy added six months to his stewardship.
                    When time ran out in early 1963, I think he came home in January, 1963, he went
                    to work for Fiberglass.</p>
                <p>The people who cared about him thought that he should have been “General Marshal”
                    and Secretary of Defense after a decent interval. But nothing happened. And
                    McNamara, the whiz kid, as you know, (and in my opinion unsuited to the job...he
                    was much too quick on the figures, much too inexperienced on the strategy...this
                    is my own opinion) took over.</p>
                <p>But long after, I saw Norstad every year for seven years and we would talk, I
                    finally asked him, “Supreme Commander, I want you to answer something from your
                    heart. Would you have been bold enough and brave enough to keep us out of
                    Vietnam, if you had been Secretary?” This was obviously a loaded question, but
                    we were on such terms that he could answer this from his heart. He said, “I
                    think about it all of the time. I believe I could have done it.”</p>
                <p>And this is a real tragedy. With his intellectual power and his boldness.
                    Kennedy, we know, was slightly ambivalent. We know from Schlesinger and others
                    that he was thinking about disengaging from Vietnam and getting rid of Rusk, who
                    was the super hawk. But it is a little footnote that I find very sad.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I think we have probably covered enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is excellent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I would be glad to do more on my four years at SHAPE. I will think of
                    other things.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will tell you what to do...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A Footnote to these reminiscences might clarify the question of the “bad blood”
                    between McNamara and Norstad. This was of course partly because of the fact that
                    they were of different political parties, and that Norstad was a favorite of
                    President Eisenhower. (Deborah Shapley's recent book, “Promise and Power,” the
                    Life of McNamara, implies this.) There was another reason to which I can
                    attest.</p>
                <p>It goes back to Cornelius Ryan's book on D-Day in Normandy, “The Longest Day.”
                    Prior to the making of the film, to be produced by Darryl Zanuck, Norstad asked
                    me to review the book to see if there was anything offensive to our various NATO
                    allies in it—especially the Germans. And he added a typical Norstad insight:
                    “Tell the scriptwriters to be sure to include the fact that the French capital
                    ship Jeanne d'arc fired the first shot off the Normandy beaches.”</p>
                <p>I screened the script and cleared it. During the actual filming, NATO and SHAPE
                    loaned some troops to Zanuck and there were a few scattered complaints about the
                    cost to the public. (In actual fact, Zanuck paid all expenses.) Robert Mitchum,
                    who played one of the key parts, had some alcoholic problems and at some point
                    refused to wade ashore. An American mother cabled us: “I didn't send my boy
                    abroad to die for Robert Mitchum.”</p>
                <p>In answer to a press query at the Pentagon, Arthur Sylvester explained the
                    brouhaha over SHAPE aid to Zanuck by saying that Zanuck were close pals. Norstad
                    came storming down to my office. “Dig up Zanuck's original letter to me,” he
                    said, “the one that began 'you don't know me but...'” Fortunately I was able to
                    produce it quickly. Unfortunately Norstad, letter in hand, called the Pentagon
                    from Paris and chewed out Sylvester in brutal fashion. And when later that same
                    year, Sylvester turned up in Paris with McNamara, Nitze &amp; Company, Norstad
                    continued to be rude to Art. The Democratic Administration was never about to
                    make a place for Norstad in any way, but this episode made it easier to ignore
                    his vast talents and potential.</p>
                <p>WILKINSON - ADDENDUM</p>
                <p>Interviewer: Charles Stuart KennedyDate: December 7th, 1993</p>
                <p>This is an addendum to an interview with Burke Wilkinson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Burke, you mentioned you had looked at what you had said
                        and you had a few things you'd like to add. So I am going to turn it over to
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, looking at the interview I realize there's one point that I
                    hadn't touched on at all, which is what I call the saga of the Brussel's World
                    Fair, 1958. Come back with me for a minute in early 1957. I was Acting Assistant
                    Secretary for Public Affairs. This is before the word Culture had been born in
                    the Eisenhower days. No one knew the word very well, and I was in the corridor
                    outside the office, and my secretary called me and said, “Get in your desk
                    quickly. The Belgian ambassador is coming officially.” And I slipped into my
                    desk, and Baron Silvercruys, who was a very popular member of the diplomatic
                    corps came rather formally to issue the invitation to take part in the fair. And
                    he said, “Wilkie, I think you better get a move on because the Russians are
                    beginning to dig.” I realized we were a little late in the day.</p>
                <p>The first problem was to find an architect, and there wasn't time to have a
                    competition. So I went to Ned Purvis who was the secretary of the AIA, American
                    Institute of Architects, and asked them to produce an architect in a month's
                    notice. And he came back to me in two weeks and we picked our man. Saarinen got
                    the British and the embassy in London so we picked the runner-up, Ed Stone,
                    famous for his grills, and the Indian embassy. And Stone went quickly to work,
                    and at the same time I formed a theme group to plan what we had in mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask a question. Here you are doing this, but had
                        money been appropriated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: That's a very good question. We immediately went to work to go for
                    some money, and that meant Mr. Rooney.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Congressman Rooney from Brooklyn, who was renown for his
                        cutting the Foreign Service down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: That's right. There was a presidential appointment of Howard Cullman
                    as the chairman of the fair, and I went down and testified with Rooney, and he
                    gave us a very rough time. We asked for $15 million, which is a good deal more
                    in those days, and we got $13, which wasn't too bad. And then I was told that I
                    could nominate the deputy chairman because we needed some real professional
                    help. They appointed a lady called Catherine Howard, who was a political lady
                    from Massachusetts and that narrowed the field to a pro, and I got a friend of
                    mine called James Plaut who had been the director of the Institute of
                    Contemporary Art in Boston. And Plaut saved the day. He really carried the mold
                    of planning the theme which was basically a gentler more cultural America. In
                    other words, this was a time of confrontation as you remember, and it was for
                    the European audience particularly to present us as not quite so uncultured.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Very quickly Stone came up with the building. That same summer we had drawings,
                    say by August of '57, and I'll check these dates. We had a luncheon to celebrate
                    their acceptance which was basically by me because no one in the Department was
                    terribly interested. And we had a lunch at the American Institute of Architects,
                    and I noticed that Mr. Stone had several gin and tonics. He had had a problem,
                    and I sat next to him at lunch, and he said, “You know Mr. Wilkinson, I hadn't
                    realized until today how big our building is going to be.” And he paused a
                    minute, and said, “It's as big as the Yale Bowl.” I thought, heavens, the man
                    who designed it, what are we in for?</p>
                <p>Anyway, time passed and my wife and I went over for the grand opening which was
                    in June, or probably late May, of '58. The night before there were some tables
                    and terraces in front of the building which are still there. The night before
                    the grand opening suddenly the lights went on, and it had fountains in front,
                    and it absolutely took our breath away. I called it the Golden Carrousel. It was
                    round and it looked as if you could spin it. It was just stunning. There was a
                    big auditorium, an amphitheater, there was an side building where we had a film
                    of America—180 degree round-the-wall screening.</p>
                <p>At the opening there was a little bit of fuss over another small pavilion which
                    was called Unfinished Business, and some of the unfinished business included
                    race riots, and I think there was a photograph of a lynching, certainly forest
                    fires and preservation problems.</p>
                <p>Under Secretary Herter came over, I think was sent by Dulles, because he heard
                    there was a little brouhaha and Dulles never quite knew what to do with Herter
                    anyway. And I took a little leave in England after the opening, I got a message
                    through the embassy to get back to Brussels, that the Under Secretary wished me
                    to be there to go around our pavilion with him. Herter was in a wheelchair so we
                    pushed him around and we came to the Unfinished Business and the photographs
                    were still being pasted and mounted and there was a very plain girl in jeans and
                    long hair putting up one of these ghastly photographs and Herter blew his
                    stack.</p>
                <p>I got back shortly to the Department, and I reported to Bob Murphy's morning
                    meeting that we had scored a tremendous success.</p>
                <p>Let me go back. I flew with Herter to London after taking him around, and I had
                    all the European press clippings and I showed them to him, and he was very, very
                    cold. Some of his Belgian friends had particularly taken him aside, and said,
                    “The American pavilion, which is dead opposite the Russian, and the Russians had
                    the sputnik in simulation going around the top of a building.” In other words
                    they thought it was effeminate, and it was decadent. We had show girls from
                    Paris in the latest modeling. A rather silly side exhibit was an edition of the
                    New York Times complete to show the 300- odd pages in one room—that was a little
                    silly.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Anyway, my clippings fell on dead ears. Back in the Department, I usually went to
                    the morning meeting of Dulles', I told you before, but this day I missed it and
                    I happened to go to Murphy's meeting, and I reported the astonishing success at
                    Brussels. At the end of the meeting, Murphy who was very, very smooth, said,
                    “Wilkie, you should know that Under Secretary Herter reported to Mr. Dulles that
                    we had scored a disaster.” And I said to Murphy, who I knew very well, “Mr.
                    Herter is absolutely dead wrong.” The upshot was the decision to send George
                    Allen, who was head of USIA then, a very adroit and shrewd observer over to
                    Brussels to decide how we really were doing. I went over and spent an hour with
                    Allen, who was a friend of mine, before he left and told him the background. And
                    Allen came back and said, “It's marvelous. We have scored a real hit.” This is
                    an interesting little glimpse of culture in the 1950's.</p>
                <p>So, Herter never mentioned it to me again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the genesis of this Unfinished
                        Business part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, obviously that had been included in the planning, but I had not
                    continually been aware of how...I suppose we got marks for being frank. But it
                    had gone a little far, they had gotten a little carried away. The pavilion is
                    gone, but that lovely little amphitheater for the movies is still there in
                    Brussels, and the movie itself is marvelous. So looking back pre-culture time, I
                    feel that we did pretty well, and it was a great lesson. One of the Belgian
                    friends, the Baroness Boel, whose husband was head of Solway, was the one who
                    had told Herter that it was a disaster. And later in the summer I had a letter
                    from her. She said, “I want you to know that I have fallen in love with your
                    pavilion. I was wrong.” Which is sort of the end of the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned some other things you wanted to talk about,
                        relations with Norstad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think that I have pretty well covered Norstad. George Vest may have
                    touched on this too. But since we last talked, he's a kind of a forgotten
                    figure. He was so good in that job, and I don't think I made the point to you
                    that this was a good time in Paris. There was Amory Houghton, as the ambassador
                    to France, there was Randolph Burgess, as the ambassador to NATO. And they both
                    were wonderful men, and they both realized the predominance of Norstad, and they
                    were out at headquarters a great deal, and they all worked together absolutely
                    beautifully. In 1961 there was a change in administration and Mr. Finletter
                    replaced Burgess, and General Gavin replaced Houghton, and the thing came
                    unstuck. Norstad was not congenial with either of them. For five years it had
                    been a marvelous combination, particularly, and I mentioned this to you before,
                    this was NATO at its finest including the handling of the building of the Berlin
                    Wall.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the building of the Berlin wall, and
                        the shock waves that set in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Of course. Kennedy called out, I think, a draft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the National Guard, a partial mobilization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: There's a point we might remember, that Berlin did not come under
                    NATO, it was a Four-Power responsibility. But Norstad, as I saw it, behind the
                    scenes was very, very good at countering Russia, it was very tricky, access to
                    Berlin. His role was never really recognized, partly because he couldn't move
                    too prominently. But it's a sad story because...I put that in my original
                    article, he probably would have been a magnificent Secretary of Defense, in the
                    Marshall tradition. But I just wanted to put in a little more about Norstad in
                    my memory.</p>
                <p>And I think that pretty well covers it because the role of public affairs in
                    these matters was just beginning to make its way. And I did mention Kennan. Did
                    you do Kennan?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. He has written his books. He really hasn't been
                        very interested in this program, at least initially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well you know, he's a fascinating man, and a wonderful writer, and I
                    have read everything of Kennan's. I was interested in how he described his exit
                    from the State Department. As you remember, he was declared persona non grata by
                    the Russians. When he arrived in Berlin he said how wonderful to be on free
                    soil. And Dulles was puzzled of what to do about Kennan. It was in those days
                    the 90 day rule—correct me if I'm wrong—if you didn't get another post, you died
                    on the vine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there still is, it comes and goes. This is for an
                        ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: In the '52 campaign Kennan made some speeches that were diametrically
                    opposed to the Republican position. Dulles called him in—I want to be clear
                    about this because McCardle told me this, so I was not involved, and you may not
                    want to use it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, put it in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: McCardle, as you know, was very close to Dulles, and Dulles called
                    McCardle in after a session...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McCardle had what position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: He was my immediate boss, the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs,
                    but was very much in the confidence of Acheson, who used the same sensitivity of
                    Carl's. And Dulles called Carl, and said, “I've just had a session with Kennan,
                    and I showed him these speeches that he had made and asked him if they were
                    his.” And as Dulles told Carl, he was absolutely thrown by this, flabbergasted
                    by being accused in this way. And Dulles, as Carl told me, very gently, said, “I
                    think you must realize that there probably isn't room for you and me on the same
                    team.” And Kennan took it very hard, said, “My people (meaning the American
                    public) will not stand for this.” And Dulles again very kindly said, “I think we
                    can work it out so the departure can be graceful.” And he said to Kennan, “When
                    we're ready to make the announcement, work it out with Carl McCardle.” And
                    Kennan said, “I don't think I need any help.” On the 87th day Carl told me
                    Kennan turned up at his desk, and they worked out the press release. And said
                    “Kennan with all his shades of academic background, is going to do what he has
                    long wished to do, go into the world of academia.” And it went absolutely over
                    with the public, and there was no trouble. It's a rather sad little story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a sad story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: And obviously not one that Kennan would write himself. He always left
                    it that he was rather brutally thrown out, but that's the story and I think it's
                    worth...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I see Kennan occasionally at Princeton, and he's grown old very
                    mellow, and we talk pleasantly, and as I said with great admiration, nobody of
                    his day wrote the language better. And those are the only points...I'm very
                    pleased with the interview we did.</p>
                <p>I had one more suggestion to you, that you interview Fisher Howe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll work on that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Head of the Secretariat under both Acheson and Dulles, so you've got a
                    double take.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>End of interview</p>
