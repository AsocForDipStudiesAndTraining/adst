                        for how many years?</hi>

                <p>BROWN: Twenty -six, including the Marshall plan.</p>

                <p>Early Years and Education</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start off by hearing a little bit about where you're
                        from, where you grew up and anything about your early family life that you
                        want to put on the record. Then we'll go to your education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I was born and raised in the San Francisco area of California. My parents
                    were both born in California —one in San Francisco the other in Los Angeles. My
                    father, who died when I was two, was a journalist. My mother was a primary
                    school teacher in San Francisco's North Beach. I was raised modestly during the
                    depression years of the 1930s in a suburb of San Francisco. All my summers and
                    winter vacations after I became a teenager were with my paternal grandmother and
                    uncle who lived in West Los Angeles. I mention this because my grandfather and
                    grandmother were great travelers and had been to Europe, Asia, Australia and New
                    Zealand in the 1920s. Their home was full of art objects they had purchased
                    abroad. In 1939, before World War II they were very much in favor of strong US
                    support for the British war effort against Hitler, and I was taken to many fund
                    raisers by my grandmother.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your education through high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BROWN: I went to public school in a small town, down the Peninsula (South San
                    Francisco). While the school was small (junior and senior high school combined
                    was about 500), and my graduating class was around 30 students, the quality of
                    teaching was surprising good. In addition to the basics, the high school had
                    strong art, drama and music departments, and my high school Latin and English
                    teachers were outstanding. I played percussion instruments, flute, and violin.
                    We used to go to the San Francisco Opera (for $1.00) every year during the
                    season. I graduated from high school in December 1941, just after Pearl Harbor
                    and our country's entry into WWII. I went to the University of California at Los
                    Angeles (UCLA) for a year before joining the Navy on May 11, 1943.</p>
                <p>World War II Years</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your experience in the military like during
                        WWII?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I spent the first 18 months in the Navy in various schools (some at
                    University level) learning how to become an electronic technician trained to
                    repair radar, underwater sound, radio and other electronic equipment. This
                    included three months at New London, Conn. learning about radar and sonar
                    devices specially made for submarines.</p>
                <p>In 1944/45 I spent three war patrols on a submarine called the USS Gabilan (ss
                    252) in the South Pacific with patrols in the Java sea, Philippines, and Japan —
                    off the entrance to Tokyo bay. Our submarine sunk seven ships including one
                    cruiser, and rescued 22 of our aviators. In addition to depth charging by the
                    Japanese on various occasions, we were shelled by our own destroyers. My navy
                    submarine experience included my first introduction to life overseas. I spent
                    six weeks at a primitive base at Milne Bay on the island of New Guinea waiting
                    for transport to Brisbane, Australia. After three months at the submarine repair
                    base in Brisbane, I joined the submarine, Gabilan. Later on, I spent two months
                    in Perth in West Australia after the first war patrol, and in the Royal Hawaiian
                    hotel in Honolulu after the second patrol.. I enjoyed my Navy experiences abroad
                    thoroughly. Our boat was off the coast of Japan in 1945 when the atomic bombs
                    were dropped, and the war in the Pacific ended soon afterwards. I was honorably
                    discharged from the Navy in March of 1946.</p>
                <p>Post WWII Education</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a bit about your educational experience after
                        WWII.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>In the fall of 1946, I returned to UCLA along with many other GIs. I was
                    fortunate in that I had lodging at my fraternity house (Sigma Alpha Epsilon),
                    and my Aunt and Uncle lived not far from the campus.Having the GI bill to cover
                    tuition, and books plus a stipend of $75 a month to live on was a tremendous
                    help. My almost three years of military service provided more than enough help
                    to complete my undergraduate degree (Bachelor of Science) from the newly
                    organized school of business administration, now known as UCLA's John Anderson
                    School of Management. In addition to my academic work, I was one of the editors
                    on the campus newspaper (The Daily Bruin), played in the marching band, worked
                    twenty hours a week at the registrar's office, and was Vice President of my
                    fraternity. It was a happy, busy time.</p>
                <p>When I graduated from UCLA in the summer of 1949, along with two friends (also
                    graduating seniors), we decided to borrow $500 each from our families, and go to
                    Europe for six months — before settling down to our respective careers. I guess
                    we were the avant garde of the “world travelers” who entered on the scene some
                    years later.</p>
                <p>Touring Europe as a Student in 1949</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine that Europe was still in the early stages of
                        recovery from the war. How did you find things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>My friend, Bob Arnold, and I left Los Angeles for Washington, DC by Greyhound bus
                    in mid August, 1949. (The third member of our group, Bob Berdahl, had already
                    left for England) After checking out Washington, DC, we headed for Montreal,
                    Canada where we picked up a British austerity vessel headed for Birmingham
                    England. Accommodations and food were Spartan, but we didn't mind. When we
                    arrived in England we bought bicycles, and toured around Wales, Stratford on
                    Avon, London, etc. for a month. The UK was still under rationing, and we were
                    issued ration cards. Most of the damage from the German bombing raids had been
                    cleaned up, but vacant lots in down-town areas still showed. Reconstruction was
                    just beginning.</p>
                <p>We then took a small ship from Harwick, England across the channel to Denmark,
                    and bicycled across it. We stored the bicycles in Copenhagen and hitchhiked and
                    rode trains through Sweden, Norway and back. We stayed mostly in youth hostels,
                    and sometimes overnight in jails at no cost. Everyone was very accommodating and
                    many shared their meager rations with us.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>We then left Copenhagen for Koblenz, Germany via Bremen. We cycled down the Rhine
                    Valley. It was devastated. In Koblenz not a building was standing, and we slept
                    in the basement of what had once been a 15 story hotel. Everyone was very nice
                    to us — especially since we were on bicycles as the population was. We did not
                    find any German citizens who felt personally responsible for the war or the
                    holocaust. In fact, many thought that the problem was not due to Hitler himself,
                    but to the bad influence of his advisors. By this time it was early November,
                    and we had frost on our eyelids as we cycled down the Rhine. We were anxious to
                    see Paris, so we bought 3rd class passenger tickets on the train from Koblenz to
                    Paris for ourselves and put our bikes in the baggage car. It was a long but
                    pleasant trip though Luxembourg and northern France.</p>
                <p>We fell in love with Paris immediately. We stayed in a little hotel called “Mon
                    Reve” (My dream). There was no heat in Paris during the winter of 1949, and we
                    almost froze to death. I remember sitting up in bed trying to keep warm, typing
                    letters home wearing gloves and my old navy fur jacket. We liked it so much in
                    spite of the cold that we decided to stay on and see Paris in the spring.</p>
                <p>I signed up at the Alliance Fran�aise to learn French under the GI bill, and we
                    all applied for work at the main offices of the Marshall plan which were on the
                    Place de la Concorde in the Hotel Talleyrand. It took considerable persistence
                    to get hired, and also for our security clearance to go through. In the interim
                    we had time to visit the Louvre, go to the theater, concerts and opera, and see
                    most of Paris's fabulous museums which were just beginning to be refurbished
                    after the six years of neglect during WWII. It was cold work since none of the
                    museums were heated. It was easy to get around since the Metro (subway) and
                    buses were fully operational. Many Parisians still used their bicycles. Hot
                    water was in short supply, and our hotel rooms had no showers and the toilet was
                    down the hall. We went to the public bath twice a week to bathe. We usually had
                    to wait in line, and took books to read as we waited our turn. All in all it was
                    fabulous.</p>
                <p>My first job for the US government in Paris was as a security guard, protecting
                    NATO secrets. As a WWII veteran, I was supposedly qualified. I was very uneasy
                    loading my “38” revolver, and unsure what I would have done if I had encountered
                    an intruder. After a few weeks one of our guards shot himself, and they wisely
                    decided to replace the civilian guards with U. S. marines. A wise decision, in
                    my view.Almost immediately after the marines arrive, in the late Spring of 1950,
                    I was hired by the Economic Cooperation Administration's regional office based
                    in Paris (OSR). I believe Paul Porter was in charge.</p>
                <p>The Marshall Plan Years (1950-1957)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were hired by the Marshall Plan in Paris in 1950. What
                        aspects of the plan did you work on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I spent a total of seven short years at the Marshall Plan's overseas headquarters
                    of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), the Office of the Special
                    Representative (OSR), Place de la Concorde, Paris. I was hired as a Technical
                    Assistance specialist working for the Marshall plan on technical assistance and
                    productivity activities. The name of the agency changed over the years beginning
                    with the Economic Cooperation Administration and its successor agencies — the
                    International Cooperation Administration, the Mutual Security Administration,
                    and the Foreign Operations Administration (1950-1957).</p>
                <p>A.Technical Assistance and International Cooperation in Europe</p>
                <p>Little did I know when I joined ECA in June 1950 that this was the beginning of a
                    career that was to span more than a quarter of a century. My first job was
                    Technical Assistance Specialist in the Technical Assistance section of the
                    Industry Division, OSR, Paris. I was recruited by Scott L. Behoteguy, Deputy
                    head of the TA Section, who went on to become a Office Director in Washington,
                    DC and a USAID Director. Our offices were in the Hotel Talleyrand at the corner
                    of the Rue de Rivoli and the Place de la Concorde. The U. S. Embassy to France
                    was on the opposite corner of the Place. Our office was a large room filled with
                    desks, chairs and telephones which were constantly ringing with calls from all
                    over Europe. My job was to process applications for technical assistance from
                    Southern Europe, and my co-worker, Norman Schoonover (who is retired and lives
                    in Paris), processed applications for Northern Europe. He also went on to become
                    a USAID Director. Our jobs were to see that the applications coming from the
                    Marshall plan countries met the Administration's criteria for technical
                    assistance. The criteria was pretty vague, so almost any reasonable sounding
                    technical assistance proposal was approved. The head of the Technical Assistance
                    Section was John T. Quinn (retired from ITT) and the Division head Mr.
                    Gihlcrest, had been head of a chemical processing plant. Many of the
                    professional staff at the regional office (OSR) were from the private sector or
                    on loan from other government agencies.</p>
                <p>In September, I was reassigned and became the Technical Assistance Specialist for
                    OEEC Operations, and was assigned the responsibility for the development and
                    implementation of an effective OEEC Technical Assistance program. The OEEC
                    (Organization for European Economic Cooperation) was the international
                    organization set up by the 17 nations receiving Marshall plan aid in order to
                    divide it up, assign priorities between countries, do economic analysis, etc.
                    Its headquarters was at the Chateau de la Muette near the Bois de Boulogne in
                    Paris. Its successor agency exists today as the Organization for Economic
                    Cooperation and Development (OECD). While Congress approved up to 29 billion
                    dollars, only 13 billion were spent on the Marshall Plan — all the same, a
                    considerable sum in the '40s and '50s.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>As part of this exercise the governing council of the OEEC had set up a Technical
                    Assistance Group (TAG) to coordinate and organize this multi-country activity.
                    My job was to work with TAG in developing an annual TA program and budget and to
                    secure approval from OSR. I was also the focal point in OSR and principal
                    coordinator for all OEEC Technical Assistance projects. This activity was so new
                    that based on operating experience I was to suggest standard operating policies
                    and procedures. The TAG consisted of representatives from the OEEC countries,
                    and the meetings were translated into French and English. I spoke for the U. S.
                    at most meetings.</p>

                <p>BROWN: In the 10 years since WWII was started in Europe in 1939, most countries
                    had fallen behind the US in critical technical, social and applied research
                    fields. Both the national and multi-national TA programs at that time were
                    designed to help the European countries close this gap. International
                    Conferences and seminars in selected fields were held in Europe and the US.
                    Consultant teams were provided from the US. Some of the fields we worked in
                    were: Metallurgy, Chemistry, Banking, Marketing, Labor/Management, Productivity
                    and Applied Research. However, the applied research was carried under the aegis
                    of a separate subcommittee that I also monitored. I arranged for representatives
                    from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Science Council (NSC), and
                    the Department of Commerce's Office of Technical Services (OTS) to attend the
                    research committee subcommittee meetings.</p>
                <p>While the major theme was to develop ways of coordinating information, to avoid
                    duplication of government financed applied research, I believe our unique US
                    contribution to Europe was the introduction of the concept of non-profit Applied
                    Research Organizations which were jointly financed by Universities and major
                    private sector companies such as Stanford Research, Southwest, Batelle, etc. In
                    the early days, these organizations were supported in good part by contracts
                    from US government Departments and Federal agencies such as: Defense,
                    Agriculture, Transport, etc. We fielded technical assistance teams manned by the
                    Directors of these institutes, who went around the major European countries
                    showing member governments, universities and industry how to set up Applied
                    Research Institutes. As a result organizations were set up in Germany, France,
                    Italy, Netherlands and the UK, I believe.</p>

                <p>( I'd like to insert a parenthesis here. In 1954, a big event occurred in my
                    life. I decided to get married to a Parisian girl, Fran�oise Durand. It was
                    necessary to get permission from both my Paris and Washington offices. Fran�oise
                    received a thorough going over from our Embassy security services, as did I from
                    the French security office in retaliation. But we both passed with flying
                    colors. We had a few anxious moments waiting for Washington's approval which
                    finally came in a telegram signed by Harold Stassen (then Administrator of the
                    Mutual Security Agency) which read “Permission granted for Vincent Brown to
                    marry”. We were married in a civil ceremony by a communist mayor in a suburb of
                    Paris (Issy les Moulineaux) on April 12, 1954. I'm pleased to report that we are
                    still married today.)</p>
                <p>While most of the Marshall Plan activities were either finished or beginning to
                    wind down by 1954, that year the technical assistance “transfer of know-how”
                    section got a new lease on life. Congress passed an amendment to the foreign
                    assistance act called the Benton/Moody amendment which called for a specific
                    program to assist the European countries and the OEEC in improving its
                    labor/management relations and subsequently improve its productivity. The
                    legislation also provided the funds to go with it. Improved management/labor
                    relations in Europe, and sharing the US experience to facilitate this
                    improvement, was very much the focus of these activities which lasted until
                    1957.</p>
                <p>One of the big activities designed to implement the Benton/Moody act (1954/55)
                    was the establishment of a European Productivity Agency under the OEEC. By this
                    time our little Technical Assistance section in the Industry division of OSR had
                    grown to a full division — The Productivity and Technical Assistance Division
                    (PTAD) was headed by Everett Bellows and Don MacPhail. A lawyer from Oregon,
                    headed up the OEEC section, his name was Hugh Smith. He was tapped to develop
                    the charter for the European Productivity Agency (EPA). A young officer on the
                    PTAD staff, Eugene Abrams (who stayed on with ECA and its successor agencies and
                    eventually became a USAID Director), was selected to write the first draft of
                    the charter, and did the detail work with the delegates to the OEEC to bring it
                    to fruition. At the national level, many of the bilateral programs benefitted
                    from this legislation and created National Productivity Centers in their
                    respective capitals. My OEEC technical assistance activities were integrated
                    into the European Productivity Agency, and the Technical Assistance group was
                    replaced by the OEEC Productivity and Technical Assistance Committee.</p>

                        its role?</hi>

                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BROWN: The US initiated EPA was one more tool in the attempt to convince European
                    businesses to adopt modern labor/management techniques, management strategies
                    and marketing techniques. As mentioned above this work had been started
                    bilaterally, and most European countries had already set up National
                    Productivity Centers including Iceland. The EPA provided a forum for the Center
                    Directors to meet, exchange information, organize inter-European teams, etc.</p>
                <p>European management in the early ''50s looked very much as it had in the
                    depression years of the 30's. While the US had made great strides in labor
                    management relations and in the whole area of marketing and advertising, little
                    had changed in Europe. Initially, there was great skepticism on the part of
                    European management, particularly, the French patronat; however, once they got
                    into it they perceived the benefits and were eager to know more. Lasting
                    relationships were established with private US management groups and labor
                    unions. Under the EPA numerous international conferences, teams to the US,
                    consultant teams, information exchange, etc. were organized.</p>
                <p>In a broader perspective, European economists, political scientists and
                    intellectuals in general were beginning to think about a European Common Market,
                    a “United States of Europe”. The multi-nation Coal and Steel Community had
                    already been initiated. The OEEC's European Productivity Organization (EPA) was
                    very much part of this thrust.</p>
                <p>Over the 1950s the names of our aid agency changed a number of times. The ECA had
                    become the Mutual Security Agency (MSA), which was transformed into the Foreign
                    Operations Administration (FOA), and by 1956 it was called the International
                    Cooperation Administration (ICA), and didn't become the Agency for International
                    Development until after President Kennedy's inauguration. I believe that
                    initially Congress hoped that the assistance effort would disappear except for a
                    little Latin America style “Point IV” once the main objectives of the Marshall
                    Plan were achieved by the mid-'50s. However, by 1957, it was becoming clear that
                    foreign assistance was not going to disappear, but would have its focus on
                    assisting developing countries — or “less-developed countries” as they were
                    called in those early years. As a result a more permanent and rational system of
                    assigning personnel was instituted.</p>
                <p>A personal anecdote which comes to mind. Bill Kontos, later USAID Director and
                    Ambassador, who was with ICA Personnel in those days, came out in early 1957,
                    and informed me that I had been working in Paris for seven years — far too long!
                    I replied that I had no objections to moving , but had just not been able to
                    bring myself to apply for a transfer.In light of my Paris office's
                    recommendation that I be sent to a francophone country to take advantage of my
                    fluent French, the Washington bureaucracy with its usual insight, proposed that
                    I be sent to Liberia, an English speaking country. Fortunately, I was rescued by
                    Don Mac Phail, the past head of the Productivity and Technical Assistance
                    Division in Paris, who by this time had been named Deputy Mission Director in
                    Tunisia (a francophone country). I was transferred to Tunis in September 1957 as
                    an Assistant Program Officer.</p>

                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Tunisia had just won its independence from France. The situation was still
                    tense when we arrived. French troops remained in the country. We were housed in
                    a charming villa in a suburb of Tunis called Gammarth. In order to go to work
                    every day we had to go through a number of road blocks manned by Tunisian
                    soldiers. Fortunately, after about six months the French soldiers were withdrawn
                    without major incident.</p>
                <p>The Tunisians were very friendly, and easy to work with. Our major contact was
                    the Planning Ministry. The French remained very much involved in the operation
                    of the Tunisian government and many of the technical positions were filled by
                    French civil servants until Tunisians could be trained to take over.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the circumstances, what kind of a “ development
                        program” did the Mission run. What activities were assigned to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: USOM (United States Operating Mission) as it was called in those days, ran
                    a development program of useful activities in areas in which the new Tunisian
                    government could use help. It was not an integrated development program as we
                    know them today. The major fields were agriculture, education, and public
                    administration. The French were very much the number one donor with their
                    position further reinforced by French nationals placed in operating positions
                    within the Tunisian government ministries. We cooperated informally, but
                    discreetly with the French, since the Tunisians were deadly serious about
                    controlling their own destiny once they were independent. As assistant program
                    officer I performed the usual program office duties: preparing budgets, helping
                    design projects, preparing study missions to the US, as well as preparing
                    reports on our aid program. In addition, I was given two additional
                    responsibilities that I enjoyed immensely.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The first involved the launching and execution of the Work Relief Program (the
                    first of its kind). It was designed as a field test to see if it was feasible to
                    use “food for work” — in this case sacks of surplus US wheat.Working with the
                    Tunisian Ministry of Agriculture, we developed a number of pilot projects in the
                    field (which were later replicated throughout the country) which employed farm
                    labor to do simple projects involving manual labor — such as terracing, dikes or
                    small earthen dams for water spreading, improvement of local markets, simple
                    farm to market roads connecting villages with the main roads so that the export
                    of farm products was facilitated. The local farmers were paid in surplus food
                    furnished by the USDA. The government put up the money for the simple tools, and
                    paid the local supervisors, and record keepers. (I don't think we had PL 480
                    yet.) Tunisia is a small country, and the infrastructure in roads and
                    communications was relatively well developed, so I visited regularly most of the
                    rural projects, met with local organizers, etc.Reporting was simple — numbers of
                    workers employed, kilometers of rural road improved, number of water spreading
                    dikes installed, local markets improved, etc. I don't recall any estimates in
                    terms of additional olive trees planted, more wheat grown, etc.; but after the
                    first year we could see the impact of these simple activities on village
                    life.</p>
                <p>My second special assignment was to work with USIS to assure that our
                    developmental activities were reported to the Tunisian people on the radio and
                    in the local press. The USIS staff was very energetic and had good relations
                    with their Tunisian counterparts.The Tunisians were very cooperative and our
                    assistance effort was easily publicized and well received by the people.</p>
                <p>Our USOM Director was a political appointee — Admiral Elliott Strauss (retired).
                    Although Strauss was new at the development business, he was a fine individual
                    and very intelligent. With a very experienced Don MacPhail (Bureau of the Budget
                    and the Marshall Plan) as the Deputy the USOM ran smoothly. My direct boss and
                    head of the Economic Analysis and Program Division, was Charles Breecher, an
                    economist of great talent and imagination. I learned a great deal about
                    government operations from both of them.I worked in French in all my contacts
                    with the Tunisian administration. Even at the village level most officials spoke
                    French; Arabic was not essential.</p>
                <p>We loved Tunisia, but on completion of my two years there, I had been overseas
                    about ten years, and the Agency decided that I needed a tour in Washington, DC.
                    I had never served at headquarters, and I approached my US assignment with some
                    trepidation. However, the US experience provided solid foundation for future
                    overseas work — i.e. learning realistically what it takes to get things done and
                    how to do them in the Washington setting.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We arrived on a Friday night, and we were put up in a apartment/hotel at
                    the corner of Wisconsin and Connecticut. By this time we had two small boys
                    (Chris — 3 years old — who was born in Paris and Greg — 1 year — who was born in
                    Carthage, Tunisia). We liked the looks of the city, but we knew practically no
                    one in Washington, DC. This was the first time that Fran�oise had lived in the
                    US except for short visits on home leave. The following Monday morning I headed
                    off for Johns Hopkins School for International Affairs, and Fran�oise started
                    looking for a place for us to live. It was really tough going for Fran�oise.
                    When I wasn't away at school, I was at home studying. Finally after several
                    weeks of looking Fran�oise rented for us a very comfortable two bedroom
                    apartment at Blair Towers at the corner of 16th and Eastern in Silver Springs,
                    and then Chris started nursery school. We stayed at Blair Towers for almost
                    three years until we were transferred overseas again. In those days Silver
                    Spring was considered very far out from Foggy Bottom, or Lafayette Square, where
                    the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) had its headquarters.
                    Washington, DC was still a fairly “small town.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BROWN: During my home leave, I'd been assigned to a six months training program
                    at the ICA Development Programming Institute headed by Dr. William T. Phillips
                    at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins
                    University at 1906 Florida Avenue. It was a wonderful program with small classes
                    covering the economic, social and political aspects of carrying out development
                    programming in underdeveloped countries — I don't believe that we had yet begun
                    to call the newly independent countries — “third world or developing countries”.
                    I still have my research paper entitled “Islands of Development —Country
                    Selection Criteria and Feasibility”. This was 35 years ago, and I don't think
                    the check list would look too much different today except there was no section
                    on “human rights” which is front and center these days. My paper's check list
                    included such major headings as: “degree of self help; existence of adequate

                <p>In addition to instruction provided by the ICA Institute faculty, and the
                    wonderful Johns Hopkins SAIS library, we had many guest speakers from the
                    academic community. The concept of interdisciplinary consideration of
                    development problems was new and terribly important, especially for those of us
                    who had just lived through the successful European recovery where economics,
                    business/management, and provision of the factors of production including
                    organized labor were the keys.</p>
                <p>B.Establishing the Asian Productivity Center (APO)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the APO assignment come about? Whose idea was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I had one more special assignment before joining the Washington
                    headquarters staff. Because of my experience with the creation of the European
                    Productivity Agency (EPA), I was selected by Don Mac Phail, who by then was
                    deputy Assistant Director of ICA, to go to Japan and work with the Japan
                    Productivity Center in creating an Asian Productivity Organization (APO). This
                    was also to be an organization designed to help coordinate the work of and
                    exchange information between the national productivity centers which had been
                    created in a number of the Asian countries: Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand,
                    India, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan principally.</p>
                <p>My consultation in Tokyo and the Far East lasted for about two and a half months.
                    It was a long time to be away from home, but a rewarding experience. The head of
                    the Japanese Productivity Center, Dr. Oshikawa, and my counterpart, Yugi Yamada,
                    were both very intelligent and hard working. While Dr. Oshikawa's spoken English
                    was limited he had an excellent command of the written word, and Yugi Yamada was
                    fluent in both written and spoken word. Fortunately, I understood almost
                    immediately with Yugi Yamada's help that Asia was not Europe, and the cultures,
                    financial resources, interests, etc. of the countries and their productivity
                    centers were not the same. As a result we designed a charter custom-tailored for
                    the interests of South-East Asia and India in about six weeks. We then went
                    around to the countries mentioned above to explain the draft charter. It was
                    accepted in principal on all sides with only minor alterations in wording. The
                    APO soon came into being located in Tokyo with some US financial help, but the
                    Asian productivity centers made the major contributions themselves and were able
                    to tap some funds from the private sector. I checked in the early 1990s and the
                    APO was still in existence.</p>

                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">You started your Desk Officer assignment just before
                        President Kennedy was elected, anhis administration took over. Did the
                        change in administration make much of a difference in your work in the
                        Africa Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes it did. The Kennedy Administration was very interested in doing
                    something to help Africa.</p>
                <p>Just before John F. Kennedy was elected and early on during his Administration ,
                    I was the Officer in Charge (Desk Officer) of the Libya program which amounted
                    to about $19 million in FY 61. Early on in the Kennedy Administration the ICA's
                    name was changed to Agency for International Development (AID). This new name
                    was very popular and remains today — with the letters “US” (United States) added
                    later making the present day acronym: (USAID).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: $19 million seems like a lot for Libya, population one
                        million in those days. Why was the grant assistance program so large?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The perceived Communist threat was very large in 1960. Many were worried
                    that the USSR would invade Europe and military installations on the perimeter
                    were very important. In those days Libya was still an ally of the US, and we had
                    air force bases there. Qadhafi had not yet staged his coup, and Libya was run by
                    the Royal Family.</p>
                <p>My desk officer duties consisted of recommending economic policy, program
                    strategy and operations, backstopping a field staff of 100 direct-hire and
                    contract employees, and preparing the Congressional presentation in support of
                    the program (The congressional presentations were much less elaborate in the
                    ''60s than they are today.). I also maintained liaison with the various AID
                    offices, State, Bureau of the Budget, and the Department of Defense.</p>
                <p>The high spot of my short eight month tenure on the desk was an opportunity to
                    make a month long visit to Libya and take an extensive tour with Director
                    Berenson, a political appointee. The Fezzan province was especially interesting
                    with “Beau Geste” style forts sitting in the middle of miles and miles of the
                    Sahara desert. There was nothing to see but sand dunes except for an occasional
                    oasis populated by nomads (Blue Men), tents, camels etc.. The men wore veils and
                    daggers, and the women did the dancing in public. Our development program was
                    relatively modest in Libya and concentrated on extension and training in the
                    agricultural sector.</p>
                <p>The effect of the new Kennedy Administration was not very evident (at least to
                    me) during the first six months. However, in June of 1961 I was transferred to
                    the Nigeria Desk and immediately felt the interest the Kennedy White House had
                    in Africa south of the Sahara.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the position of Officer in Charge for Nigeria
                        Affairs so special at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: As Officer in Charge of Nigerian Affairs I was in charge of and
                    responsible for an aid program involving a long term commitment of grants and
                    loans of $225 million toward Nigeria's Six Year Development Plan. Joel
                    Bernstein, was the “brilliant” Director of the Mission, and Walt Rostow who was
                    then, Counselor for Economic Affairs under President Kennedy, took a personal
                    interest in Africa in general and Nigeria in particular. Not only had Nigeria
                    recently become an independent of the British “colonial yoke,” but it had the
                    largest population in Africa. The multi-year loan (for a dam across the Niger
                    River) was one of the first of its type to be presented to Congress and the
                    White House took a special interest. I used to go over to Walt Rostow's
                    beautiful office in the Executive Mansion from time to time with Ollie Sause,
                    who was the deputy head of the Africa Bureau, and sit in on the strategy
                    sessions. It was an extraordinary time to be a desk officer, since it was not
                    uncommon to receive a telephone call directly from the White House staff asking
                    detailed questions. I backstopped the Nigeria mission's direct hire and contract
                    employee staff of 200. They were spread out throughout Nigeria. During that
                    period, I was responsible for preparing the visits to the US of the Nigerian
                    Ministers of Finance, Plan and Agriculture. They were all very intelligent,
                    sophisticated and highly educated, and had been carefully selected and trained
                    by the British to take over and run their country. Most of them had Oxford
                    degrees. It was a great catastrophe for the country that after the end of their
                    third year of running the government, they were all killed in a military coup.
                    The new military leaders had no where near the education, talent, and experience
                    of their predecessors.</p>
                <p>The World Bank was very much involved in the development effort, and some
                    thirteen countries participated in a consortium designed to coordinate the
                    enormous aid effort. While I was on the desk, we sent some 353 participants to
                    the US for practical training during that period. I learned a great deal about
                    economic analysis at that time, since the long term forecast was essential in
                    making the decision to supply long term funds.</p>
                <p>I still have vivid memories of my month long trip to Nigeria (Lagos and the three
                    provincial capitals). I visited a number of development projects, government
                    offices (both federal and provincial), in addition to the USAID mission.
                    Coordination, and liaison work with other departments of AID, State, Bureau of
                    the Budget and other US government office was an important part of the desk work
                    in Washington. Dick Cashin was the Division chief and a big help.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The Nigeria development program in the early 1960s was in many ways a forerunner
                    of things to come. It used University contracts very effectively (e.g. the
                    University of Michigan group helping establish the new University of Nigeria at
                    Enugu in Eastern Nigeria, and another contract to assist the University of Ife
                    in Western Nigeria.) The use of direct hire AID employees was perhaps at its
                    zenith with over two hundred direct hire employees. Many of the “new” direct
                    hires had distinguished previous careers as Agricultural Specialists, Education,
                    Public Health, Public Administration, Economists, Engineers, Transport Experts,
                    etc. Their long years of practical experience in the US was invaluable to the
                    fledgling Federal and Provincial government.</p>
                <p>Later experience showed that it was not necessary that such a high percentage of
                    USAID personnel be direct hire in order to carry out the jointly agreed
                    development programs. The ideal mix was to keep the proper balance between
                    direct hire and contract personnel. While increased use of contracts with
                    Universities, NGOs/PVOs, Consulting firms reduced substantially the need for
                    direct hire personnel, the effectiveness of the contractors in a development
                    context was reduced if the USAID Director did not have a sufficient
                    professionally qualified direct hire personnel to competently supervise the
                    contracts. This resident staff was also necessary to work with the relevant
                    ministries, help evaluate progress on existing programs, and guide design teams
                    for new projects and programs. (This conclusion is developed more thoroughly in
                    the section entitled “Lessons Learned and US Foreign Assistance — a 45 Year
                    Perspective.”)The making of long term loans for capital projects in the Agency
                    was in its infancy. Some of the capital projects (e.g. electric power stations,
                    irrigation systems) were 100% US financed projects (low interest rate, long term
                    loans); and others like the huge Niger dam project were worked out as jointly
                    financed projects with other donors, including the World Bank playing a major
                    role.</p>
                <p>In the late '50s/early '60s not much attention was paid to accurately setting out
                    measurable goals, and providing the means of measuring the progress or lack of
                    it. However, in the case of Nigeria, there was a general feeling of significant
                    positive “development” momentum, both on the Nigerian side and the donors. The
                    long term prognostication for successful development was favorable</p>
                <p>What was ignored was the political side. Even though most of us were aware of the
                    fierce rivalry between the three provinces (West, East and Northern Nigeria) and
                    their resistance to any control or actions by the Federal government, democracy
                    programs, decentralization, and crisis management programs didn't exist.
                    Attempts to encourage development of the private sector were in their infancy.
                    As the years have passed, AID has become much more sensitive to the political
                    realities and tried to work out cooperatively development programs which take
                    into account social and political as well as economic conditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>A word of caution here is in order. For any successful development program, it is
                    a question of balance. If we add a political dimension it in no way should
                    diminish the importance of the economic and social factors i.e., stabilization
                    agreements, capital projects, non-project assistance, private sector
                    initiatives, community development, self-help efforts, PL 480 resources, etc.
                    Given the diverse and dynamic nature of the developmental challenges, there is
                    no single approach to successful development that works in all cases.</p>
                <p>I will always be grateful for this period in my experience in the Agency. I
                    learned a great deal about how to get things done in the US government during
                    this time. In November 1962, I was assigned to Office of the AID representative
                    to the Republic of the Congo (now called Zaire) as Assistant Director.</p>

                        Zaire when you arrived. What was the ambiance ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We (Fran�oise, the two boys, and I) arrived in Kinshasa in December 1962.
                    The airport was filled with C-130 transport planes engaged in ferrying troops
                    and supplies to Katanga to put down the rebellion lead by Moise Tshombe. We were
                    met by Rob West, the AID Director (who was also Economic Counselor of the
                    Embassy). He was a prominent development economist on loan from the Ford
                    Foundation. It took us three hot and sticky hours to clear customs and head for
                    the city.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Our early days in Kinshasa remains etched in my memory. On the way into town, we
                    were informed that the house originally set aside for us had been given to
                    another family, and we would be in a temporary apartment until another suitable
                    one came on the market. Our apartment was downtown, reasonably comfortable and
                    overlooked the local bordello which was frequented by many of the senior
                    government officials. So we got a rather unique view of the ruling clique early
                    on during our stay. Our refrigerator had barely enough food for our evening
                    meal, and my wife was informed that she would have to be ready by 7 am the next
                    morning to go to the local market to shop for food. (There was no commissary
                    since the US Ambassador, Mr. Gullion, didn't want anyone on board who couldn't
                    rough it.) Since there was virtually nothing on the commercial market except PL
                    480 powdered milk, life was very difficult until one's shipment from Ostermann
                    Peterson arrived four months later with everything from toilet paper, to
                    powdered milk, to canned beans, coffee, soap, etc. Once it arrived if one was
                    missing something one could trade with our colleagues. There was a very large,
                    well stocked, United Nations Commissary, but we were not allowed to use it. We
                    were not moved into a full sized house for at least eight months. Survival
                    during the first three months was indeed difficult. I don't think the
                    Ambassador's decision not to have a commissary and to let the newcomers “rough
                    it” added to our performances.</p>
                <p>Actually, the basic infrastructure, streets, homes, business buildings, etc. in
                    Kinshasa had been built for the long term, and were still in excellent shape.
                    Unfortunately the Belgians had not judged it necessary or desirable to train an
                    elite as the British and French had. So at independence, there were only 17
                    Congolese college graduates, and about 500 high school graduates (mainly
                    priests). This was not enough to run a country larger than the US east of the
                    Mississippi (one million square miles). Before pulling out the Belgian colonial
                    government had stationed some 5,000 professionals in Zaire. The UN staff which
                    was running the country when we arrived numbered 2700.</p>
                <p>The Belgians had not considered it necessary to educate the local women, so
                    except for a few women educated by missionaries, none could read and write. A
                    further problem was that apart from French (and a little Flemish), there was no
                    common language. Most of the country was made up of village states with their
                    own individual languages or dialect — something over 300 to 400. Fortunately,
                    many of the tribes along the Congo River (now called the Zaire River) spoke a
                    composite language called “lingala.”</p>
                <p>Life in the early days was alleviated by the possibility of taking the ferry
                    across the Congo River to Brazzaville. The Republic of the Congo, which had been
                    a French colony, was well stocked with French foods and supplies. Food was very
                    expensive, but a real treat. However, after we had been there for about six
                    months, the two governments got into an argument and the frontiers remained
                    closed for the rest of our stay.In spite of this rocky start, by the end of the
                    year we were well installed and enjoying the post.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the work like under those circumstances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: AID Director, Rob West, had his office at the Embassy, and I had my office
                    along with the rest of the AID contingent in a separate building not far from
                    the Embassy.Since there was no Deputy Director, and I was the only Assistant
                    Director, I managed the AID staff on a daily basis. Rob West was mainly
                    interested in the economy, major aid policy matters, and very important project
                    decisions. The offices were comfortable and well kept. The major problem was
                    that there was a curfew at dusk, and I often had to work late at night. It was
                    really difficult driving home in pitch black darkness hoping that I would not
                    meet military patrols since the soldiers were often illiterate and did not
                    understand French.</p>
                <p>Because of the value of our multi-million dollar commodity assistance program and
                    the counterpart (local currency) it generated, the USAID was entitled to a seat
                    on the United Nations run Economic Planning Commission (EPC). I used to attend
                    their meetings, when Rob West could not make it. Everyone around the table of
                    the Commission were foreigners. The Chairman of the EPC was a UN employee from
                    Algeria, the head of Public Works (buildings, roads, streets) was a UN employee
                    on loan from the French department of public works, and the Governor of the
                    Central Bank was French, etc. Due to the lack of educated citizens from Zaire,
                    the only Zairian national at the Planning Commission meetings (sitting in the
                    back row) was a young man who had just graduated from Louvain University in
                    Belgium, Mr. Endele. (About ten years later he became Governor of the Central
                    Bank). I still remember one of my instructions from Rob West was to inform the
                    Commission that import quota's for toiletries, fountain pens, and ladies
                    brassieres were to be sharply reduced, and quotas increased for chemicals and
                    industrial materials needed by the local factories.I also sat on the EPC
                    subcommittee charged with allocating the counterpart. Most of it went for
                    keeping the road network operational.</p>
                <p>These were exciting times. I went up to northern Zaire with the Minister of
                    Public Works (Mr. DelVaux), a Zairian, and the UN supplied operating head of the
                    Public Works department, Monsieur Larchet (French), to participate in a ribbon
                    cutting ceremony for a stretch of road reopened through work financed by our
                    counterpart funds. The event was also attended by the local chief, the local
                    witch doctor with his crocodile hat and parrot feathers on, the local priest,
                    and the girls in uniform from a nearby Catholic school for girls. One week later
                    communist supported rebels roared down the road in trucks. For a while they
                    controlled the northern part of the country. With help of Belgian paratroopers,
                    Nigerian police, and C-130 air transport provided by the US, the uprising was
                    put down.</p>
                <p>I remember meeting Governor Harriman at that time, and being very impressed. He
                    was in his mid '70s and had come out to Zaire at the request of the President to
                    work out the peace agreement. He was very polished, dynamic, needed very little
                    sleep, and wore out the staff assigned to work with him. The necessary
                    agreements were drafted, negotiated, and signed in just a few days.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>By my second year there, things had settled down considerably. President Kasavubu
                    had invited Moise Tshombe back as Prime Minister and most basic facilities were
                    operational — roads, railway and river transport. Rob West had returned to the
                    Ford Foundation, and an experienced AID Director, Stuart Baron, replaced him.
                    His last posting was in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to know any of the Zairian Ministers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I got to know two of them fairly well. Mr. DelVaux, who was the Minister
                    of Public Works, was one of the few educated indigenous people — perhaps in his
                    mid forties. He had been working in Belgium at independence, and was brought
                    back to head this technical Ministry. On special occasions, like ribbon cutting
                    ceremonies, he would wear his dark Belgian double breasted suit made of heavy
                    100% wool. Needless to say he perspired profusely, but was suitably dignified.
                    He listened to his UN technical advisors and ran his Ministry well considering
                    the circumstances.</p>
                <p>The Minister of Finance, Mr. Bamba, had been the leader of the Kibangist
                    religious movement in Eastern Zaire. He knew nothing about finance or economics,
                    but he was a fine human being. He wisely left the running of the Finance
                    Ministry to his UN staff.</p>
                <p>His church used the Protestant bible, and its founder, Mr. Kibangi, believed that
                    Jesus Christ was a black African. Minister Bamba invited us to dinner several
                    times and also to a number of his Sunday morning church services which were very
                    simple and austere with palm fronds as decoration. Unfortunately the year after
                    we left Zaire, the Minister was hanged for some sort of alleged plot against the
                    government. I find it hard to believe that this mild mannered religious leader
                    deserved such a fate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any personal anecdotes of life in Kinshasa
                        once you were settled in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Actually, we were quite comfortable, and all AID/embassy housing was
                    fenced in. Our local guard was armed with bow and arrow. However, on most nights
                    when we returned from a party or official reception, we would have to wake him
                    up to open the gate. While petty theft was a problem in outlying areas, local
                    police protection was assured by the Nigerian Federal police who were excellent.
                    Their headquarters were only two doors down the street from where we lived, and
                    our two boys would “tricycle” down every evening to take part in the lowering of
                    the Nigerian flag ceremony. As a result, we became quite friendly with the
                    Nigerian Commander, and nothing was ever stolen from our house..</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Our third child was born in Kinshasa at the Lovanium University hospital which
                    was still manned by Belgian doctors and Belgian Catholic Sisters. Because of the
                    curfew still in effect at dusk, when the time for the birth of our third child
                    drew near, I began to study “home delivery” in case we could not drive the 12
                    miles to the University hospital. We also applied to Prime Minister Tshombe
                    office for written permission to travel to the hospital at night during curfew
                    hours should it become necessary. However, the value of such a paper was most
                    uncertain since practically all of the soldiers patrolling were illiterate.
                    Fortunately, one week before “Valerie” was born, the curfew was lifted. The head
                    nurse, a Mother Superior from Belgium, who had stopped counting after her one
                    thousandth delivery, carried out the delivery with the Belgian doctor called in
                    to do a little stitching up. (In those days, AID did not send one's wife home to
                    have a baby.) As it turned out the expatriate medical personnel who had stayed
                    on at the University hospital after independence were excellent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the lessons learned, if any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Good question! Even though we all know from experience that each
                    developing country has its own particular characteristics and set of problems, I
                    think that Zaire was really unique, especially in 1962. Zaire was bereft of the
                    educated indigenous talent needed to run the country. Except for the colonial
                    rule of the Belgians, there was no history of any indigenous government except
                    for small kingdoms in southwestern Zaire (the bas Congo), and southeastern Zaire
                    (Katanga), and these existed a century or two prior to the takeover by Belgium.
                    There were no dominant tribes in a national sense. Most of the country was
                    thinly populated and ruled by village to county level leaders.</p>
                <p>In those early years of independence, Zaire was completely run domestically by
                    the UN staff, with the Belgians and the US having a strong say in any actions
                    taken. I believe the US country team representing the information service
                    (USIS), the economic/social (USAID), the military and political including the
                    CIA, functioned well together under the leadership of the Ambassador. In the
                    short term — the first four to five years after independence, a functioning
                    government was restored (albeit largely expatriates), rebellions were put down,
                    and the economy was restarted. There was an ambiance of impending prosperity
                    down the road. Our relations with the other major donors, the Belgians, French,
                    UN, were excellent. When Mobutu took over in a military coup, no one
                    prognosticated 35 years of despotic rule. In fact in the early years of his
                    regime, before he nationalized all of the major industries, the economy did
                    relatively well.</p>
                <p>With 20/20 hindsight, perhaps our weakest point (and our partners' also) was to
                    have concentrated almost all of our energies in creating the stability needed to
                    allow the economy to function, and to address the political/social needs only in
                    “dire circumstances”. Could we have done more with “democracy programs”, private
                    sector programs to encourage indigenous small businesses, education of the
                    population, public administration training in running a free market economy?It
                    is hard to tell?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Would a firmer hand with Mobutu made a difference when he nationalized the
                    private sector, started siphoning off most of the national wealth, and raised
                    the corruption in his administration to new levels? Perhaps it might have.
                    However, our failure to crack down should be evaluated in the context of the
                    cold war. The US response to Mobutu's dubious, undemocratic actions was governed
                    in large measure by our competition with the USSR during the cold war years.This
                    is a case where the political factors were dominant, and a crucial drawback to
                    the economic and social development of Zaire — a country that should have become
                    the richest country in all of sub-Saharan Africa . Some thirty five years later
                    Zaire (Congo) is not just stuck at the goal line, it is substantially behind
                    it.</p>
                <p>Certainly democracy building programs are not easy. The current on-going
                    experiment in a much smaller country, Haiti (with no history of democratic
                    government and a literacy rate of under 30%), shows how difficult it is to train
                    an effective police force, establish an effective judiciary, organize political
                    parties, assure fair elections, keep corruption to a minimum, carry out the
                    necessary reforms, etc.Even in those developing countries where carefully
                    crafted stabilization programs have been worked out and cooperatively
                    implemented with excellent results, there has been political instability—
                    military coups, civil disorder, etc. Having highlighted the lacuna that existed
                    in 1950s through 1980s on the political side of many development programs, one
                    must not fall into the trap of thinking that “democracy (political action)
                    programs” are the whole solution. It is a question of balance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Overall, how do you rate your posting in Zaire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: While serving in Zaire was tough, in the end my family and I thoroughly
                    enjoyed the post. We felt that our tour of duty there was stimulating and
                    rewarding. I learned a great deal professionally.</p>
                <p>In September of 1964, I was transferred directly to South Korea as Assistant
                    Director for Program and Economic Policy. I was delighted to have the
                    opportunity to work with Dr. Joel Bernstein, who had been USAID Director in
                    Nigeria, when I was the Nigeria Desk Officer in Washington, DC.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you arrive in South Korea, and what was the
                        political, economic and social climate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BROWN: We arrived in Seoul early in the morning of October 3, 1964. Contrary to
                    our arrival in Zaire, everything was handled very efficiently. We were through
                    customs in minutes, and on our way to our home. Our little house was comfortably
                    furnished and waiting for us in a gated area on one side of the UN Military
                    Compound called South Post. As we entered our home, I was informed that I was
                    expected at the office for a meeting. So I left Fran�oise and the children at
                    home to unpack, and went directly to the office to start work. This heavy,
                    urgent work load would continue non-stop during our three years in Korea. I
                    never worked so hard before, nor since.</p>
                <p>The USAID offices took up a whole building in downtown Seoul, not far from the
                    Korean Economic Planning Bureau (EPB). (Actually the USAID office in Korea in
                    those days was called a USOM, United States Operating Mission. But I'll use our
                    current term for an AID mission (USAID) from here on out.)</p>
                <p>Politically, this was a period of great internal stability. President Park
                    Chung-Hee and his political party had been elected with a large majority. The
                    government was firmly established with full support of the military. There was a
                    small opposition party of no serious consequence.The potential threat from North
                    Korea was constantly with us, and provided a strong incentive for unity. While
                    it is no longer the case today, in the ''60s Americans were still considered
                    “blood brothers” having successfully fought together and stopped the Communists.
                    Students were very active in those days as they are now. However, at that time
                    the demonstrations were over issues such as whether to accept reparations from
                    Japan or not. The spirit of team work between the Koreans and the Americans at
                    all levels was at an all time high.</p>
                <p>Economically, while most people were very, very poor the economy was in the early
                    stages of an economic take-off which would remove it from the US economic aid
                    roles after a few years. South Korea had a number of significant pluses. Most of
                    the infrastructure damage caused by the Korean war had been repaired and
                    modernized. The population was 98% literate in Hangul, the Korean language. This
                    literacy made it much easier to introduce new techniques in agriculture, and
                    made its workforce easy to train in the manufacturing sector. Korea's free
                    market economy approach was very attractive to foreign investors, especially the
                    US and Japan as well as a number of Western European countries. The years of
                    supplying the US military based in Korea had taught Korean business men the
                    importance of quality control, and complying with contract specifications and
                    standards on a consistent basis. In 1964 the export drive started in 1960 was
                    beginning to take off. In fact the USAID had a very talented, dynamic, “hands
                    on”, export promotion advisor, Amicus Most from New York City, who was very busy
                    and effective in helping the budding Korean export industry grow faster.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The USAID annual program of Development Loans, Technical Assistance (consultants
                    and participant training), significant food imports, PL 480 (Titles I, II, III,
                    and IV), and Commodity Import Grants totaled close to $260 million a year. When
                    this amount was added to the invisible earnings from the presence of the US
                    military (roughly another $150 million) gave the US considerable economic
                    leverage. In fact the USAID had a joint economic stability agreement under which
                    the USAID jointly monitored the Korean government's economic activities on a
                    monthly basis.</p>
                <p>Socially, the Koreans were and continue to be an extraordinarily homogeneous
                    group (no tribal or ethnic problems as experienced in Zaire). They were
                    traditionally hard workers who put an extraordinary value on education whether
                    from the rural or urban areas. There was tremendous competition to get into the
                    local universities. They had a great sense of humor and were dubbed by those who
                    knew them well as the “Irish of the Orient”.While it tended to be a “man's
                    society”, the wives we met were well educated, and put an extraordinarily high
                    priority on the education of their children in this very competitive
                    society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the scope of your work at the USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN:As Assistant Director for Program and Economic Policy, I was responsible
                    for the overall development of the aid program content and strategy. For example
                    in 1966 the Supporting Assistance component was $66 million, PL 480 Title 1 $50
                    million, II &amp; III $25 million, $5 million Technical Assistance, $120 million
                    for Development Loans plus a won (Korean currency) budget support program for
                    defense and development. The program office I supervised consisted of 27
                    Americans and 38 Koreans. The program office coordinated the preparation of
                    program submissions and their execution by the USAID Divisions. I also served as
                    the principal staff advisor to the Director on overall program content and
                    execution.</p>
                <p>On the Korean side I negotiated at the Vice Minister and Bureau Chief level on
                    matters of program content and execution, and worked out systems of joint
                    planning and consultation. I also accompanied the Mission Director to all of his
                    meetings at Ministerial level. I would be at the office very early, leave late
                    taking documents home to read, work almost every weekend. Three or four nights a
                    week (perhaps more) I was out at official functions related to our work.</p>
                <p>One of the most important sections in the program office was the economic policy
                    and analysis branch headed by a Harvard development economist on loan to AID,
                    Dr. David Cole. He and his staff of US and Korean economists monitored the
                    Korean's economic performance and kept them on the “straight and narrow” in
                    executing our joint economic stabilization agreement and achieving the various
                    goals agreed to in our negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Another of Director Dr. Joel Bernstein's very innovative ideas was the creation
                    of a “think-tank” group in the program office. The small group of staff officers
                    was called something like “New Programs and Initiatives Section.” It was headed
                    up by Dr. Princeton Lyman who went on to become a USAID Director in Ethiopia,
                    and US Ambassador to South Africa. The two other members were Don Cohen and Eric
                    Chetwynd, who in later years became a USAID Director and a Office Director.When
                    a new program initiative was being considered by the USAID, it was given to this
                    group who worked up detailed programs, policies and operating procedures. Some
                    of the programs developed by this office included integrated Rural Development,
                    Export Promotion, and Family Planning.. They also were called upon to help solve
                    problems in existing programs — for example, in Agriculture and Education. This
                    overview of ongoing major programs was a big help in making mid-course
                    corrections before they became a crisis. Something similar might be considered
                    today in the larger, priority USAID missions around the world.</p>
                <p>The Korean officials, staff and private sector managers worked extremely hard. If
                    we sent a letter to the Planning Ministry on Friday requiring a quick, but
                    complicated answer, they would work all weekend and more to meet the deadline.
                    Sometimes they would rent a suite in a down town hotel, so that their
                    professional staff could work uninterrupted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this hard work recognized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes it was! In addition to my regular duties, I served as Deputy Director
                    when the Deputy Director, Roger Ernst, was away on leave, and also when Director
                    Bernstein was away and Roger moved up to be Director. It was a challenging
                    learning experience for which I was very grateful. I should mention that to help
                    me with my work, the USAID recruited an excellent, experienced, Deputy Assistant
                    Program Officer, Garnett Zimmerly, who was of great help in running the program
                    office. He went on to be Director in the Philippines some years later where he
                    was killed in an airplane crash during a field trip.</p>
                <p>The long hours and devotion to the program was recognized. During my three years
                    in Korea I was promoted to FSR-1 (about a GS 16), was decorated with the order
                    of civil merit by the President of Korea for my contribution to Korea's economic
                    development, and received a very laudatory merit award from AID signed by USAID
                    Director Bernstein, and US Ambassador Winthrope Brown from the State side.</p>
                <p>I guess the most wonderful part about the three years that I worked in Korea, was
                    the sense of accomplishment. The economy grew spectacularly in agricultural
                    production as well as the manufacturing sector. The increase in the standard of
                    living of the Korean people was visible to the naked eye.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We all know of South Korea's continued success both
                        economically and as a functioning democracy. The list of countries
                        graduating from our assistance roles is not very long. Are there some
                        lessons to be learned here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN:Before getting into specifics, I should like to point out that by 1964, the
                    USAID had already established itself as a major factor or force in South Korea's
                    economic/social reconstruction period after the end of the fighting in the late
                    ''50s. Although earlier prognostications were that it would take 25 to 50 years
                    before South Korea would be able to “go it alone,” in only 15 years after the
                    end of the fighting, the situation was beginning to change dramatically.I
                    believe this stunning turnaround would not have taken place were it not for the
                    US foreign assistance program.</p>
                <p>During these years, the amounts of technical assistance including participant
                    training, program grants, loans, and emergency food were consistent from year to
                    year and very large. By the mid ''60s South Korea was entering into the
                    “takeoff” phase of development. Although the $150 million a year in 1964
                    represented a substantial reduction in aid levels over previous years, it still
                    was a major help to the Korean economy. The commodity import program still
                    provided much need raw materials for Korean industry.</p>
                <p>The capital development loan program was hitting its stride. Loan financing for
                    private petroleum refineries, chemical plants, and manufacturing industries was
                    stimulating the economy. Public sector projects which assisted agricultural
                    development, roads and dams were already underway. Electric power, and port
                    rehabilitation projects were in their final phases.Almost all of these
                    development activities were financed with a combination of grants and long term
                    low-interest rate loans. The invisible earnings from the presence of the 50,000
                    or so US troops were over a $100 million a year.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, one of the most important development tools of the ''60s was the
                    economic stabilization agreement which made the USAID a full partner with the
                    Ministry of Plan in programming the scarce resources, monitoring the
                    government's collection of domestic revenue, its expenditure levels, and the
                    relative emphasis between development and consumer spending. The USAID Program
                    Office's economic section met monthly with the Planning Commission to review the
                    monthly statistics as well as the allocations of foreign exchange. The needed
                    economic discipline was supplied by the USAID during these joint meetings. Had
                    the USAID not been there, the Planning Commission might have bowed to domestic
                    pressures for excessive government subsidies and consumer spending.
                    Psychologically, this joint programming was palatable to the Koreans because
                    their US colleagues were considered “blood brothers”. Almost all of the civil
                    servants we dealt with had been directly effected by the North Korean invasion
                    and were very grateful for the US standing by their side in time of crisis.
                    Economic stabilization agreements for major USAID programs have become more and
                    more common in recent years. I believe the success of the agreement in South
                    Korea, helped lead the way for more widespread adoption of this technique.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>In addition to the bonding between Americans and Koreans which grew out of the
                    Korean war, I would like to highlight two factors that greatly facilitated our
                    joint cooperation in the development of South Korea:</p>
                <p>Education: Literacy was about 90% in Hangul, the Korean language, and the average
                    Korean family was ready to make great personal sacrifices to assure that their
                    children received a good education. This made it much easier to introduce new
                    concepts and techniques since we could use the written word as well as oral
                    communication to present new ideas.</p>
                <p>Stability:South Korea is about as ethnically homogeneous as a country can be. One
                    hundred percent of the population considered themselves Koreans. The government
                    was stable, and in full control of the country. The threat from the North was an
                    additional reason for the population not to “rock the boat”. This stability was
                    attractive to foreign investors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds very rewarding ? Did you make any lasting
                        friendships?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes. One in particular comes to mind. My primary contact in the government
                    was the head of the Planning section in the Economic Planning Bureau. His name
                    was Yang Yoon Se. He was about my age and also served as the personal advisor to
                    the Deputy Prime Minister, Chang Key Young, who headed the Economic Planning
                    Bureau. The Deputy Prime Minister was called the DPM by most of his staff and
                    was nicknamed the “bulldozer” for his ability to get things done. We (Yang Yoon
                    Se and I) hit it off famously and as a consequence were able to arrange/sort out
                    informally many “difficult and delicate issues” between our respective bosses. I
                    believe this worked in large part because of our mutual respect and trust. In
                    later years, Yang Yoon Se went on to become Minister of Agriculture and Minister
                    of Energy. We kept in touch and our two families renewed contact in the 1980s.
                    By this time he had left government and represented a private Korean company,
                    “Gold Star”, in Washington, DC as their Vice President in charge of US
                    operation. Both of his children eventually obtained their doctorates in US
                    Universities.</p>
                <p>During my last summer in Seoul (1997), I was asked if I would like to become a
                    Fellow at the Harvard Center for International Development. (It was a kind of
                    sabbatical to recharge the intellectual batteries of AID officers likely to move
                    up into policy making positions, and to help prepare them for that step.) I
                    accepted and AID sent me for training as a Harvard Fellow at the Center for
                    International Affairs for an academic year beginning in September 1967.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it difficult finding lodging and getting the family
                        installed, especially since your time in the US was for less than a
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We moved to Lexington, Massachusetts (a historic bedroom community near
                    Boston), and our installation was greatly facilitated with the help of David
                    Cole and his wife who had returned to his teaching post at Harvard that summer.
                    Settling in quickly was necessary, since the Monday after our arrival, I started
                    attending seminars at the Center for International Affairs, and the children
                    started school in Lexington. The Center's program was organized and run by Dr.
                    Benjamin Brown — (no relation).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a special Program offered by the Center? If so,
                        what did it involve and who were the other participants. In short, what were
                        the parameters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Under the Harvard Center for International Affair's program, Fellows were
                    invited from around the world. We were 16 in all. Five were from the US: Lloyd
                    Jonnes and I from AID, John Baker from State, Colonel Harold Moore from the US
                    Army, and Colonel John Smith from the US Air Force. Other Fellows came from
                    Canada, Egypt (UAR), France, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, Pakistan, UN
                    (UNECA), UK, Yugoslavia. We were housed by two's in tiny offices in the top
                    floor of the Center. My roommate was Jacques Le Compte from the French foreign
                    office, later to become Ambassador Le Compte. The Fellows were a mixture of
                    military officers, aid officials, foreign office types, government
                    administrators, and research administrators. Incidentally, Henry Kissinger had
                    his office (much larger) on the ground floor. Besides teaching, he headed up the
                    prestigious US/Soviet joint committee of University professors which met
                    annually — one year in the USSR and the other in the US. Little did I know then
                    that in a few years I would have an opportunity to brief Henry Kissinger several
                    times during my postings to Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>The Center had several themes in which the Fellows were to be jointly briefed in
                    seminar fashion. They included East/West relations (in a cold war context), the
                    developing world, international politics and international economics. The
                    Vietnam war was still very active, so this was included in our list of topics.
                    We attended a two hour seminar three times a week on these various themes. The
                    rest of the time we were free to do our thing. We could write a book, journal
                    articles, take graduate classes, explore the Harvard library with direct access
                    to the stacks, etc. Degree taking was discouraged, although Lloyd Jonnes got
                    permission and earned a masters degree during the academic year. At the end of
                    the year we were all required to do a research paper on a topic of our
                    choice.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I elected to take development economics classes at Harvard's Development
                    Economics Center. (I took classes from Drs. Wally Falcon, Carl Gotch and Gus
                    Popenek, and car pooled with them. I also attended lectures given by Ray Vernon
                    at the Harvard Business School. Both the seminars and the classes constituted a
                    wonderful experience. I learned a great deal in the field of economic and social
                    development.</p>
                <p>The Center's seminars focused on cold war topics, international politics and
                    development issues. The speakers were first class. We were given one or two
                    hours of preparatory reading for each seminar. Usually the Fellows lunched with
                    the guest speaker (usually internationally known at the top of his or her field)
                    who lectured for about an hour. Then the seminar was opened up for questions and
                    answers for about an hour. What a treat it was to participate in the
                    give-and-take expressed, especially given the diverse set of backgrounds of the
                    Fellows. It really expanded one's intellectual horizons — a thought provoking
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Much of program offered by the Center was designed to provide a broad based
                    intellectual foundation for future decision makers. Almost all of the
                    participants (Fellows) were upper middle management who had been selected for
                    their potential to move ahead as policy makers, or decision makers — e.g.
                    Ambassadors, Permanent Secretaries, Ministers, Mission Directors, Research
                    Center heads, etc.</p>
                <p>I wrote my research paper at the Center on one aspect of a country that had
                    fascinated me for many years — Indonesia — where I would have liked to have been
                    posted. It was entitled “Development in Indonesia: The Skilled Manpower
                    Problem.” I'm not too proud of it. Indonesia was not a country of concentration
                    at Harvard. However, I learned a great deal about Indonesia and its problems.
                    The discipline of doing the research and writing a paper summarizing the results
                    was a useful exercise.As it turned out I would never be posted there.</p>
                <p>We enjoyed being back in the United States, and Lexington was a wonderful place
                    to live for the family. Most of our social life was with the Fellows in the
                    Center program and their families, but we also had a chance to meet a good
                    number of the Harvard faculty. The academic year flew by.At the end of the
                    school year in June of 1968, I learned that I had been appointed to Pakistan as
                    Deputy Director. Our first posting would be in Lahore, but only for a few months
                    before moving to Pakistan's new administrative capital, Islamabad.</p>

                        as Deputy Director?</hi>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BROWN: Bill Kontos was the Director when I arrived, and I replaced Dr. Ernst
                    Stern as Deputy Director. Bill Kontos only stayed about one year after my
                    arrival and was replaced by Joe Wheeler. Bill Kontos went on to head up the UN
                    mission on the Gaza strip and became an Ambassador in the State Department. I
                    had known Bill Kontos when he was deputy USAID director in Nigeria under Joel
                    Bernstein and I was the Nigeria Desk Officer in Washington. However, we had
                    never worked closely together.</p>
                <p>Dr. Ernst Stern, the departing Deputy Director, and I debriefed in the Bois de
                    Boulogne one sunny afternoon in Paris. Ernie was on his way back to Washington,
                    DC and I was en route to Pakistan. Ernie had a brilliant career in AID, and
                    several years later he resigned from USAID and joined the World Bank where he
                    eventually rose to second in command.</p>
                <p>Bill Kontos' replacement as Director in September 1969 was Joe Wheeler. Joe
                    remained at post in Pakistan for over four years. He then went on to become
                    Deputy Administrator of AID, and eventually was elected to the prestigious post
                    of Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization
                    for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris where he served for
                    several terms.</p>

                        What did you and the family think about another overseas assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We had always enjoyed our overseas assignments, even tough ones like
                    Zaire. The children were used to the small international schools. I was
                    delighted to be assigned as Deputy Director to a post with a sizable aid
                    program. Also, the Economic Development Institute at Harvard had a long
                    association with the aid program in Pakistan, and some of the Professors who had
                    worked in Pakistan, such as Wally Falcon and Carl Gotch, had very helpful
                    background information to share.</p>

                        Pakistan was Islamabad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: When I arrived in the summer of 1968, the USAID was in transition. Several
                    years earlier the capital of Pakistan had been transferred from Karachi to the
                    newly created town Islamabad in the Northwestern part of the country — near
                    Rawalpindi. Initially there was insufficient housing for the diplomatic
                    community and aid missions to transfer to the newly created capital, so USAID
                    headquarters were transferred to Lahore, provincial capital of the Punjab, with
                    part of the staff left in Karachi. By 1968 the situation had changed. Most of
                    the government ministries had been transferred to Islamabad, and the government
                    was pressuring the US government to transfer the USAID headquarters there as
                    well, even though housing was extremely limited.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay in Lahore for long? Apart from orientation,
                        what were your first tasks as deputy director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We only stayed in Lahore for the summer. After a few weeks orientation, I
                    was assigned the task of preparing the move to Islamabad. This included working
                    with the Pakistan government in Islamabad to find suitable office space, housing
                    for staff, directing the administrative arrangements of the move in stages so
                    that our very busy aid program would not be disrupted. In early Fall, as soon as
                    the executive officer and I could find adequate housing, we moved our families
                    to Islamabad. While the building we contracted for was being built to house the
                    USAID, we rented temporary quarters for the USAID office.</p>
                <p>I remember that Fran�oise and the children were looking forward eagerly to the
                    move. The weather in Lahore had been, humid, dusty and 120 degrees almost every
                    day since our arrival, and Islamabad was 15 to 20 degrees cooler. None of our
                    personal effects, except for the air freight had been unpacked, since we knew we
                    were to move. Even though there was not much in this administrative capital in
                    the early days (Islamabad was declared Pakistan's official capital in 1967,
                    although they had been working on the infrastructure since 1961), our family
                    took to Islamabad immediately. It was well laid out with wide streets and
                    residential neighborhoods that were well-defined as were the commercial and
                    industrial areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size and scope of USAID Pakistan? And in this
                        context what were your duties as Deputy Director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Pakistan was one of the four or five largest aid missions at the time. We
                    administered a sizable non-project commodity import program, a PL 480 program, a
                    large technical cooperation program, and were responsible for one of the largest
                    portfolios of capital projects in the world. The USAID staff (”Mission
                    personnel” as they were called in those days — approximately 190 Americans and
                    490 locals) were distributed between West and East Pakistan (now the independent
                    country of Bangladesh). Provincial offices existed in Lahore, West Pakistan and
                    in Dacca, East Pakistan (3500 miles from headquarters in Islamabad) A small
                    contingent was continued in Karachi which remained the financial and commercial
                    center of Pakistan. I used to go over to Dacca about once a month. Too bad they
                    didn't have Frequent Flyer miles on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>My duties were simply stated in my job description. The Deputy Director:1) served
                    as the Director's alter ego — spoke and acted on his behalf in all aspects of
                    management of the Mission and its program. Participated fully in all program and
                    policy matters and assumed primary responsibility for day-to-day operating
                    matters. 2) Provided operational supervision and guidance, on behalf of the
                    Director, to the Assistant Directors in Lahore and Dacca as well as the Division
                    Chiefs. 3) Served as Acting Director of Mission during absence of the
                    Director.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Mastering the program was a real challenge. It took a full six months to become
                    familiar with all the aspects — especially given the concentration during the
                    early months on arranging for the move of the USAID from Lahore to Islamabad,
                    and almost immediately filling in for Director Kontos during his home leave
                    shortly after my arrival. In addition to the headquarters duties we were always
                    traveling to visit our provincial offices. The trip to Dacca (East Pakistan)
                    required a whole day flying across India at its widest part. Later in my stay
                    when East Pakistan was fighting for independence India closed its borders, and
                    we went to Dacca via Sri Lanka. The span of management control was broad. The
                    Deputy Director supervised six Assistant Directors, one Special Assistant, one
                    Regional Legal Advisor, five Division Chiefs and one American Secretary. We
                    tried to keep in close communication with our staff. As a result both the
                    Director and the Deputy Director were almost always traveling. When one was in
                    Islamabad the other was invariably visiting East or West Pakistan. All of the
                    staff under my supervision turned out to be highly experienced and very
                    competent which greatly facilitated my work.</p>
                <p>All of the technical cooperation projects, commodity assistance, capital
                    projects, PL 480 food were carried out in close consultation with the Pakistan
                    government. This, of course, was a very important dimension to the work, and
                    helped assure the efficacy of the programs and projects.</p>
                <p>Although the work had been started long before my arrival in Pakistan, I should
                    mentioned the success that resulted from the introduction of “Mexi-Pak wheat” in
                    West Pakistan and “IRRI rice” This demanded a tremendous effort, not only in the
                    development of the high yield seeds, but also in teaching indigenous farmers how
                    and when to plant these seedDuring my time in Pakistan the results of the
                    introduction of Mexi-Pak wheat (developed in Mexico), and the IRRI rice
                    (developed in the Philippines) were spectacular. Increases in yield of 25 to 30%
                    for the special rice and wheat were commonplace.(The new seeds were also
                    introduced into India with a huge success, especially in the Punjab.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier that Bill Kontos was replaced by Joe
                        Wheeler after the first year. Did this change your working
                        relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Joe Wheeler arrived in September 1969. By that time I was very comfortable
                    in my position as Deputy Director. Bill Kontos and I had settled down to a good
                    working relationship and I was sorry to see him leave.</p>
                <p>Having said that, Joe Wheeler was in a class by himself — a marvelous Director.
                    The USAID program prospered during the time he was there. He and I got along
                    exceptionally well. For the remaining three years that I worked for Joe, I
                    sincerely felt that I acted as his alter ego. We understood each other very
                    well, and I had no difficulty grasping his program goals and participating in
                    their successful implementation. Along with my tour of duty in South Korea,
                    these three years constituted one of the high spots of my career in AID.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation like at the end of the
                        ''60s and early ''70s? I understand their was considerable turmoil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In November 1970 there had been a tremendous flood wiping out much of East
                    Pakistan's rice crop. General Ayub Khan had resigned and turned over leadership
                    to another military leader, General Yahya. Although AID and other donors made
                    significant food donations under their disaster, the situation remained
                    desperate in the East. The USAID through its PL 480 food program was the largest
                    single donor.</p>
                <p>In 1971, East Pakistan was in ferment. The local political party led by a Bengali
                    leader named Mujibur Rahman, began calling for independence. His call had a
                    tremendous response from the impoverished population. Over one million people
                    showed up in downtown Dacca to hear Mujib advocate independence. The West
                    Pakistan government responded by severe military interventions, which further
                    inflamed the population. By September, not only was tension at boiling point
                    between East and West Pakistan, but India leaning heavily in favor of the
                    Bengali's drive for independence.</p>
                <p>By the Fall of 1970, we had upped the amounts of PL 480 food going into East
                    Pakistan and were going all over the country setting up supply depots to
                    facilitate distribution. All economic assistance to Pakistan had been cut off
                    except for humanitarian aid, as the repressive measures from the Central
                    government (i.e. the West) escalated.</p>
                <p>I still remember one of my East Pakistan field trips near Chittagong. I had spent
                    a sleepless night on the floor of a guest house in a small town in the interior
                    as the Pakistan army lobbed grenades over the roof into a local market. As we
                    left the next morning for Chittagong, there were rumors of the Bengali rebels
                    placing mines in the road. Our carryall came rapidly around a turn in the road
                    only to see that there were a number round spots in the road about a foot or two
                    in diameter where the asphalt had been dug up. All conversation stopped as we
                    roared over these spots, expecting to hear an explosion as we ran over a mine at
                    any second. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief at the next corner when we
                    spotted the provincial road repair crew.In Dacca, there was a curfew, but we
                    could hear shooting in the streets every night.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate to catch one of the last commercial PIA flights out of Dacca for
                    Islamabad before the militarily closed the airport. I slept on the airport floor
                    the night before departure to be sure I would be there on time for the early
                    morning flight.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>In December 1971, East Pakistan succeeded and called itself BangladesAs the
                    violence grew, 10 million East Pakistani's fled to India. India intervened in
                    early December with its army. There were major battles in the Punjab near
                    Lahore. While West Pakistan's air force held its own against the Indian air
                    force, the Pak army was no match for the superior Indian forces. In 13 days the
                    West Pakistan army was defeated. While most of the USAID and Embassy staff had
                    been evacuated to Afghanistan, our family remained in Islamabad. We watched the
                    bombing of Islamabad's airport by two jets fighters from India from the terrace
                    of our home.</p>
                <p>After the surrender, on December 20, 1971, General Yahya turned the government
                    over to Zulfikar Bhutto, who had been the leader of the opposition party. Since
                    Bhutto was a leader elected by the people, the government was under civilian
                    leadership, and the obvious domination by the military had receded, our
                    development program for Pakistan was soon reinstated and back on track.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do any other events stand out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, one involving Henry Kissinger. I believe he had just taken over as
                    Secretary of State a few months prior to his visit. His stopover in Islamabad
                    was the last stop on a trip to the Far East in which he visited Japan, Hong
                    Kong, Thailand, India and Pakistan. Joe Wheeler was in the US on consultation,
                    so as Acting Director I was elected to give Kissinger the economic/aid briefing
                    prior to his seeing the Ministers of Plan and Finance the next day.</p>
                <p>When he arrived at the USAID directly from the airport, he complained of stomach
                    trouble, and after 15 or 20 minutes of briefing excused himself to go to the
                    Embassy nurse for some medication. Winston Lord was with him. Later that evening
                    I received a call at home advising me that Henry Kissinger had decided to spend
                    a few days at the Government's Presidential home in the Hindu Kush mountains
                    near the Kashmir frontier to rest up and recuperate. Winston Lord represented
                    him on our visits to the Finance and Planning Ministers. Four days later we were
                    asked to be at the airport to say good-by to Kissinger who had fully recovered.
                    When I shook his hand, I asked how his health was and he replied “splendid” as
                    he bounded up the ramp into the air force plane.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>The next morning our Ambassador, Joseph Farland, called a special country team
                    meeting at which he announced that Henry Kissinger had been to China, and had
                    made arrangements for President Nixon to visit. The whole visit had been carried
                    out in great secrecy so that if it had failed no one would have known. Several
                    month earlier Ambassador Farland had gone to Palm Springs, California to see
                    about “selling one of his coal mines”. (He was a political appointee who owned a
                    number of coal mines in West Virginia.) At the country team meeting, he
                    explained that his personal visit to the US was a cover story. He left Pakistan,
                    not knowing why he had been asked to set up this subterfuge. When he arrived at
                    Los Angeles airport he was taken to Frank Sinatra's private plane and flown to
                    Palm Springs and taken to Sinatra's estate. When he arrived, there was Henry
                    Kissinger waiting for him, alone. Ambassador Farland was asked to set up
                    Kissinger's secret visit to China via President Yahya. (Pakistan had had
                    excellent relations with China since independence.)</p>
                <p>So it was prearranged that when Kissinger arrived in Islamabad, he would pretend
                    to be sick, and would be taken up the Pakistan president's mountain retreat to
                    rest up and recover. Actually, early the next morning under cover of darkness he
                    was taken in a government car to Islamabad airport. The car drove into one of
                    the hangars where he got into a PIA 707 jet and flew to Beijing. When they came
                    back, they landed at the US air force base in Peshawar (about 90 miles from
                    Islamabad), and he was helicoptered back to the mountain retreat from which he
                    publicly exited the next day. Counting the arrival and departure days, four days
                    had elapsed. We all know, of course, that shortly after President Nixon carried
                    out his historic visit to China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the aid program survive with all of this political
                        upheaval, and the suspension of economic aid for a time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: We were very fortunate in that the permanent civil service, both at
                    federal and provincial level, was very understanding, and did its best to keep
                    the various projects moving during the suspension of aid. So although there was
                    considerable upheaval at the political level, the permanent civil service, who
                    were quite competent, remained at their posts. The dialogue never stopped, and
                    the aid funding that was in the pipeline was permitted to continue. Our
                    technical cooperation consultants, teachers, extension agents, and investment
                    advisors continued to be welcome, although most of the programs were either
                    slowed down significantly or put on hold. As mentioned above the humanitarian
                    assistance (e.g. PL 480 food) was never stopped.</p>
                <p>Our aid office in Dacca converted from the East Pakistan Provincial office to
                    USAID Dacca in Bangladesh. While the staff on the USAID side stayed about the
                    same, there was much more of a shakeup in the civil service since many of the
                    senior personnel serving in Dacca were from West Pakistan and had to be
                    repatriated. Many of the replacements in Dacca were Bengali's who had been
                    working as part of the Pakistan Federal Civil service in Islamabad. They
                    resigned in order to return home, and serve their country.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While Pakistan was one of our priority countries for many
                        years and many positive things have happened from a development standpoint,
                        its political record has not been outstanding. What are some of the lessons
                        to be learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Although Pakistan received only limited physical structures at
                    independence (the colonial capital being New Delhi, which went to India), one of
                    the most important legacies from the British was a trained civil service, and an
                    educated elite capable of running the country. Also the basic infrastructure
                    such as roads, irrigation systems in the Punjab, railroads and ports were
                    already in place. English was widely spoken, and widely used, along with Urdu,
                    in the running of the government. This heritage was an enormous help in running
                    the newly independent country.</p>
                <p>USAID Pakistan was blessed by a succession of talented Directors, such as Maury
                    Williams, and Joe Wheeler who both went on to become deputy Administrators of
                    AID, and successive Chairmen of the multi-national development assistance
                    committee (DAC) at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
                    (OECD) in Paris.</p>
                <p>Probably, our greatest contribution was in the field of agriculture. Tremendous
                    efforts were made to help modernize (electrify) the irrigation system in the
                    Punjab — Pakistan's breadbasket.Major training programs were launched and
                    successfully carried out to train Pakistan's agricultural extension services.
                    They would play a major role in the introduction of the Mexi-Pak wheat and the
                    IRRI rice along with the use of fertilizer. Both of the new varieties produced
                    spectacular increases in production — around 30 to 40% increase in yield. Major
                    programs were introduced to help the Pakistan provincial and federal governments
                    cope with the growing problem of salinization by convincing the farmers to dig
                    and/or pay for the supporting drainage ditches on their land.</p>
                <p>Pakistan had one of the largest loan portfolio's in AID. These low interest long
                    term loans helped jump-start the chemical industries to produce fertilizers and
                    pesticides, and many other basic factories. Commodity import programs helped
                    provide the raw materials needed for these activities. On the technical
                    assistance side, substantial help was provided to the Pakistani business
                    community. Business loan programs were set up in the provinces to expand the
                    industrial/business base beyond the port city of Karachi.</p>
                <p>During my years in Pakistan, we were careful to jointly finance our development
                    programNot only was there substantial Pakistani technical/management input in
                    each project design, we insisted that they also share in the financing of the
                    activity — largely with their payment of most of the local currency
                    expenditures. I believe this helped assure the continued success and financing
                    by the Pakistanis when the levels of US assistance began to decline;
                    essentially, because they considered the projects their own.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Another breakthrough was in the area of Family Planning. Even though there was
                    significant initial and continuing reluctance because of the Muslim orientation.
                    a major program was started which made a good start in reaching the feminine
                    population. While the overall progress has not been spectacular, it did
                    demonstrate that it was possible to make some inroads in family planning in a
                    Muslim country. For example, family planning and training for female family
                    planning field workers was introduced — a significant breakthrough.</p>
                <p>Rural Development represented another area of concentration. In the Northwest
                    Frontier province (in Peshawar) a Rural Development Institute was founded.
                    Cooperatives were encouraged for farm workers and for starting small businesses.
                    Much progress was made in encouraging the start of small businesses in the rural
                    areas and providing low-interest, long term loans. Prior to the small loan
                    program, the farmer or prospective entrepreneur had to go to the “village money
                    lender” for his loan (10 to 20% per month). When I left 1972, both the programs
                    in West Pakistan and East Pakistan (Bangladesh) were well launched and doing
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Pakistan, how did your wife and family
                        like it there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: All of us really enjoyed Pakistan, and living in Islamabad in particular.
                    There was an excellent international school with an US curriculum. Our two sons
                    enjoyed it. Our eldest Chris was student body president and Greg played center
                    on the touch football team. Valerie was in primary school and we felt that her
                    teachers were excellent. The two boys took to the culture and had a number of
                    Pakistani friends who went to the international school. Zulfikar Bhutto's
                    children went to the International School and our two boys were often invited
                    over to the Bhutto's for a swim. They told us that Bhutto always found time
                    during the day to talk to his children and bring them up to date on his
                    political activities. Chris and Greg learned to speak Urdu.</p>
                <p>Fran�oise was very busy. As the wife of the Deputy Director, she had considerable
                    social entertainment responsibilities— i.e. preparing official lunches, dinners,
                    and receptions. We had many official visitors to USAID/Islamabad, and when Joe
                    Wheeler was away we would do the necessary entertaining. In addition since we
                    were both fluent in French we were often invited to dinners at the Ambassadors.
                    We had a beautiful new home with a rose garden that Fran�oise planted as well as
                    gardeners, guards, servants. Fran�oise also worked with a group that helped
                    handicapped Pakistani children. She was active in the international woman's club
                    and participated in many joint activities with the Pakistani woman's club.</p>
                <p>In April 1972, I was transferred next door to USAID Kabul as Deputy Director to
                    replace Victor Skiles (who had already left). It was understood that I would
                    replace Bart Harvey as Director in Afghanistan after his departure in late
                    Fall.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Afghanistan is among the 25 least developed countries of
                        the world. What did your family think about the move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Our family had visited Kabul as tourists two previous times, and had
                    enjoyed our brief visits. However, we were very happy in Pakistan. Fran�oise and
                    the children were great. They were prepared to make the move cheerfully, mainly
                    because they knew the new posting offered an opportunity for me to become a
                    USAID Director in the late Fall.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned earlier, I left for Kabul to take up a post as Deputy Director at
                    the end of April, and Fran�oise stayed behind in Islamabad to allow the children
                    to complete the school year. I returned to Islamabad in early June and we left
                    on home leave returning to Kabul at the end of the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the long overlap with the outgoing Director awkward?
                        You arrived in April and he left in late Fall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It was not difficult; in fact it worked out well. The outgoing Director,
                    Bart Harvey and his wife couldn't have been more charming, and Bart did his best
                    to introduce me to my counterparts in the Afghan government and prepare me for
                    my duties as Director once he left. On my side I tried to be a loyal and
                    effective Deputy Director, understanding that Bart would be fully in charge
                    until he left. I think this approach was effective with the USAID staff, and
                    they were spared having to deal with two management approaches
                    simultaneously.</p>
                <p>During this transition period I also had a chance to get to know the US
                    Ambassador, Edward Neumann, a political appointee ex professor of political
                    science from UCLA, who took a strong, detailed interest in the aid program. He
                    was very supportive, and understood AID's development concerns; however, he saw
                    the AID program very much as a tool of diplomacy. While his priorities were
                    clearly in the political domain, he understood its potential of a successful aid
                    program to produce a positive impact on US/Afghan relations.The deputy chief of
                    mission was Sam Lewis, a career diplomat of great talent, who went on to become
                    our Ambassador to Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Ambassador Neumann was replaced after about a year by a career diplomat, Theodore
                    (Ted) Eliot. Ambassador Eliot did a marvelous job. He was well liked by both the
                    American staff and the Afghans. He and his wife (Pat) both spoke the local
                    language (Farsi) which was a important asset. He was very supportive of the AID
                    program. He allowed the AID Director maximum flexibility, and was always there
                    to help out with senior levels of the Afghan government should the need arise.
                    He left Afghanistan and retired about a year after I left in December 1976,
                    about six months before the communist takeover. After he retired, Ambassador
                    Eliot went on to become the Dean in charge of Fletcher School of Law and
                    Diplomacy (located on the Tufts University campus in Boston).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size of the USAID program? Give me some idea
                        of its composition and goals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The AID mission consisted of about 50 direct hire and 50 contract American
                    employees and 300 Afghan employees. The development program involved $10 million
                    in grants annually and an active loan portfolio of over $50 million. The capital
                    loans were for long term (40 years and a low interest rate.) In addition, during
                    the drought years we provided substantial amounts of PL 480 emergency food
                    relief.</p>
                <p>To give you some background on the conditions at the time, it is worthwhile
                    noting that Afghanistan was identified as one of the “25 least developed
                    countries” by UNCTAD (The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development).
                    Estimates of yearly income averaged out to about $100 per person compared to
                    $690 in Turkey and $900 in Brazil at that time. Fewer than 12% of all Afghans
                    were literate and the percentage in the rural areas was much lower — for rural
                    woman only about 6/10th of one percent. In a public health survey taken around
                    1972, on the average only four children survived to adulthood of an average of
                    eight born to each woman. The infant mortality rate was over 20%, and less than
                    two percent of the woman had ever heard of a modern family planning method.</p>
                <p>The USAID Afghanistan projects were focused on helping the people : to grow more
                    food; be healthier; and live better. While we still had a very active loan
                    portfolio when I joined the mission, new bilateral loans were few and far
                    between. We were no longer a major direct financier of large, capital projects
                    under our program. The capital projects mantle had shifted to the World Bank
                    (IBRD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We, of course, pointed out to the
                    Afghan government that as the major contributor to both banks , we were
                    providing assistance indirectly for major capital projects carried out by the
                    World Bank (IBRD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you be more specific about some of the major
                        development assistance activities while you were Director from 1972 through
                        1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BROWN: I'll be glad to. First, I would like to put our position as a donor in the
                    1970s into perspective. The cold war was still very much with us, but our aid
                    posture had changed from the '50s and '60s when we were major contributors to
                    the building up of Afghanistan's basic infrastructure. Some of the larger
                    projects included: the US financed the Kabul/Khandahar/Herat road to the Iranian
                    border, plus a substantial part of the Kabul/Jalalabad road to the Pakistan
                    border, and most of the costs of the road going north to the Hindu Kush
                    mountain. The Soviet Union financed the only other major paved road in the
                    country covering much of northern Afghanistan to its border. Afghanistan's
                    northern frontier borders on the states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and
                    Tajikistan.</p>
                <p>Another substantial US capital investment was in the Helmand Valley. In the '50s
                    and ''60s the US had made considerable investments in such things as: a dam
                    which supplied the water to the Helmand Valley, a hydro-electric power plant,
                    and the construction of irrigation canals, etc., not to mention a major
                    technical assistance effort to help the Ministry of Agriculture turn desert
                    nomads into irrigation farmers.</p>
                <p>We also contributed to the construction of Kabul University along with the French
                    and Germans.</p>
                <p>By the '70s the nature of our development assistance program had changed. Major
                    capital assistance projects were to be done by the World Bank and the Asian
                    Development Bank.Any talk of balance of payments support, stabilization
                    programs, commodity assistance, infrastructure was the domain of the World Bank
                    (IBRD) Rep. Fortunately, the Bank's reps were excellent and easy to get along
                    with. We had frequent opportunity to meet informally and work together.</p>
                <p>Our program continued to be a major one for the Afghans. Its focus was on people
                    oriented projects and programs, and technical assistance to help open new areas,
                    as well as maximize the value of our earlier capital investments.</p>
                <p>A principal concern from the outset, as Director, was the continued success of
                    the Helmand-Arghandab Valley Authority project (HAVA) in the southern part of
                    Afghanistan which literally made the desert bloom by bringing thousand of acres
                    under irrigation (about 100,000 acres). The US had already provided to the
                    Helmand Valley project more than one hundred million dollars over the past two
                    decades, and this irrigated area was producing increasing amounts of wheat,
                    corn, melons, cotton, and other valuable food and fiber crops. Our focus in 1972
                    was on draining the water from four large irrigated farm areas in the Helmand
                    Province to prevent water-logging and salt build-up that was damaging crop
                    growth. The HAVA as we called it was literally the “bread basket” of the
                    country.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>One very innovative project which went hand in hand with the Helmand Valley
                    project was a US financed fertilizer distribution project to help build an
                    effective fertilizer distribution network utilizing private retailers. Before
                    its establishment fertilizer was virtually unavailable to Afghan farmers, and it
                    was needed to take advantage of the new high-yielding varieties of wheat and
                    corn and to increase production of cotton, grapes and other crops.</p>
                <p>The Afghan Fertilizer company (AFC), an Afghan Government corporation, was set up
                    in 1972, to import much needed fertilizer as well as arranging the distribution
                    of local manufactured nitrogen fertilizer. The government corporation was a new
                    concept for the government long used to doing everything through the Ministry of
                    Agriculture bureaucracy which had very limited capabilities. The AFC also
                    distributed other agricultural inputs (pesticides and seeds). To help assure its
                    operation success the USAID financed a key technical cooperation project which
                    provided four experienced advisers under a contract with Checchi and Company.
                    The advisers were well selected and the project was an outstanding success. When
                    I left Afghanistan in December 1976 there were 400 retail dealers located in
                    every significant farming area in the country.</p>
                <p>Our emergency food program played a vital role in 1973. In the late 1960s and
                    early 1970s Afghanistan experienced a number of unusually dry years, and by 1973
                    the US, UN, Soviet Union and other governments at the request of the Afghan
                    government, were all beginning to contribute important amounts of food to help
                    meet the urgent needs. The crisis had reached famine proportion, and it was
                    estimated that some 80,000 had died of hunger the preceding year before the
                    government formally asked for help from foreign donors. Generally speaking, US
                    assistance went to help the population south of the Hindu Kush mountain range,
                    and the Soviet and UN supplies were distributed north of this mountain range
                    (many peaks over 14,000 feet) which divides the country in half. Given the
                    limited road network, much of our PL 480 food supplies were distributed by a
                    combination of rented trucks and camel caravans (some of the caravans were as
                    long as 100 to 200 camels). Our Assistant Director for Administration, Abe
                    Aschanese, was a tremendous force in helping the Afghan government get organized
                    to deliver the food quickly over almost overwhelming odds. During the “famine”
                    years, the only area which continued to produce food was the Helmand Valley
                    which depended on irrigation, and was instrumental in limiting the loss of life
                    during those years.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Health services for those living in rural areas of Afghanistan were virtually
                    non-existent. A basic health services project was established to help the
                    Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) extend health services to rural areas where 85%
                    of the people lived. Four professional consultants were provided from the US non
                    profit firm Management Sciences for Health, MSH (under USAID contract). The MSH
                    team did an incredible job assisting the Ministry in planning, training,
                    carrying out basic health field demonstrations and analyses, personnel,
                    commodities, administration and general management. The advisors had the full
                    confidence of the Minister and his senior staff. While small relative to the
                    need, the million to two million dollar a year grant budget provided substantial
                    leverage in helping get the primary health care program off the ground. One of
                    the constant battles was to design the program so that it included women and
                    children. Prior to this project, what little public health effort that existed,
                    was limited to the urban area and focused on providing help to the male elements
                    of the population.Grant money was also available to help finance simple primary
                    health care centers around the country. A pilot effort of 50 centers were built
                    and staffed during my stay and plans were under way to expand the effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given what's gone on over the last 17 or 18 years and the
                        political chaos which continues to reign, are there any signs remaining of
                        this highly successful Primary Health Care program carried out by MSH?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN:I'm glad you asked that question! I was just reading a very recent
                    “Afghanistan Trip Report” written by Elisabeth Kvitashvili of the Office of Food
                    for Peace covering the period from April 23 to May 5, 1997. In Section XII.
                    Implementing Partners: (UNICEF), she writes about UNICEF activities in
                    Afghanistan, and I quote: “NB: I questioned UNICEF if they saw any evidence of
                    the cold chain system put in place by Management Sciences for Health (MSH)
                    during the 1980s as part of the AID Cross Border program. UNICEF said that in
                    many places, Jalalabad, Ghazni for example, the MSH cold chain remained intact
                    and functional.”</p>
                <p>Actually the first steps of introducing “cold chain” systems (necessary for
                    preserving vaccines and other medical supplies) in the major primary health care
                    offices was initiated by MSH when they were working with the Ministry of Health
                    in the mid ''70s. This is good example of the lasting impact of work well done,
                    even under chaotic conditions.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>One of the critical needs was to train women to serve as health care workers. The
                    training of Auxiliary Nurse Mid-wives (ANMs) was done at a ANM school partially
                    financed by the USAID with two nurse advisors furnished under contract from the
                    University of California (Santa Cruz) campus. Women mid-wives were essential
                    since cultural taboos inhibited women from seeking medical help unless female
                    personnel were present to serve them. It was extremely difficult to get any of
                    the educated Afghan women to live in the rural areas, so the recruits were
                    carefully recruited from the rural areas so that they could live with their
                    families in the rural areas near the primary health care facilities. By April
                    1976 100 ANMs had been graduated and were working in the field. While this
                    project was very tiny compared to the nationwide needs, it was revolutionary and
                    ground breaking in the male dominated culture.</p>
                <p>In 1976 the USAID made a grant to the Afghan Family Guidance Association (AFGA)
                    to help expand the delivery of family planning and maternal /child health
                    services to provincial areas. This was a small private organization with links
                    to the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London. This was a small
                    beginning, but was indicative of opening of government thinking we were
                    experiencing under President Dad's leadership, with Minister Khorram in charge
                    of the Ministry of Plan.</p>
                <p>Before leaving our aid program, I should mention the outstanding work done in the
                    field of education by Columbia University Teachers College and the Ministry of
                    Education. Together they revised the primary education curriculum and textbooks,
                    especially in Farsi and Pushtu (the local Persian languages) and mathematics.
                    Afghan educators were trained in the US and with the help of American advisors
                    resident in Kabul completely revamped the primary education curriculum, field
                    tested it and supervised its installation in the primary schools. The new
                    textbooks were actually printed at the local Education Press. The learning
                    results in the first year in mathematics were 30% quicker and better, and about
                    25% more effective in the local languages of Farsi and Pushtu.</p>
                <p>At the University level, the University of Nebraska furnished a team of
                    professors (deans) that advised primarily in the fields of agriculture,
                    education and engineering. In addition, the Rector of the Kabul University (a
                    wonderful US trained Afghan) could call on their experienced advice in running
                    the University. Many of the Afghan university professors were educated in the US
                    and contributed to a high quality of instruction in the respective departments.
                    The President of the University of Nebraska took a personal interest in
                    Afghanistan, and later created a Center of Afghan Studies at the University
                    headed by Tom Goutierre, who had worked in Afghanistan on the University of
                    Nebraska contract as an advisor to Kabul University.</p>
                <p>I've gone on at some length about the USAID program which was in its 20th year
                    when I arrived in Kabul. I've done so because I think it made a significant
                    difference in the lives of the Afghan people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that the USSR also served as a major donor to
                        Afghanistan. How did the Afghan government handle the two cold-war
                        powers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The government dealt with us separately. The Soviet Union was largely
                    restricted to Afghanistan north of the Hindu Kush (a western extension of the
                    Himalayas), and the United States and other Western donors restricted to the
                    South. The modest UN agency activities (e.g. UNICEF, the World Food Program,
                    etc.) were permitted to operate throughout the country, as were the World Bank
                    and Asian Development Bank projects. Since Afghanistan was on the periphery of
                    the Soviet Union, their Ambassador was a senior official in his government's
                    hierarchy. Prior to his posting in Afghanistan he had been Prime Minister of
                    Russia, and a member of the politburo. Fraternization of between our two
                    countries' aid personnel was not encouraged by either the Afghan government, or
                    the US or the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Afghanistan politically stable during your stay? Did
                        this have an effect on your aid program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Basically, it was a stable period. When I first arrived, Afghanistan was
                    still a monarchy. The heads of the various Ministries were generally well
                    educated in one of the Western countries — France, Germany, UK and the US.
                    Occasionally one would meet someone at Ministerial level who had done their
                    studies in the USSR. It was rare. Most of the civil servants who were trained in
                    the USSR were at modest management levels in the government.Most of them were
                    unsympathetic to the communist way of life.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1973 the King Zahir was overthrown, and a republic was
                    proclaimed, headed by his first cousin, Muhammad Daud, who had been Prime
                    Minister from 1953-1963.The coup only lasted about 24 hours, and in about a week
                    things were back to normal. The king and his family were exiled to the Isle of
                    Capri in Italy on a generous pension.</p>
                <p>However, during the takeover there was a lot of shooting and some lives were
                    lost. I still remember very clearly the morning of the coup. About 7:30 in the
                    morning of the coup we were on our way to the airport to pickup my cousin and
                    his wife and two children who were coming for a two week visit. Before we left
                    home, I was suspicious. Our telephone would not work, and jet planes were flying
                    over the city. However, our chauffeur who had come to pick us up and take us to
                    the airport explained that he thought there had been a jail break and we could
                    go ahead with our plans.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Fran�oise and I and the children got in the car and started for the airport. At
                    the first major intersection, there was a tank parked with its cannon pointed
                    down the road in our direction. Out in front was an Army sergeant waving his AK
                    47 and signaling us to stop. We all got out —including the wife and children —
                    with our hands held high in the air. The soldier looked terrified and I thought
                    I noticed that the safety latch was off on his AK 47. Fortunately, our chauffeur
                    had the presence of mind to explain in the local language (Pushtu) that we were
                    on our way to the USAID compound which was nearby. He did not reveal that we
                    were headed for the airport. He then asked, very politely, if we could be
                    allowed to proceed to our office compound. The soldier agreed and said we were
                    to stay off the streets. By the time we got to the USAID office most of the
                    staff had arrived. We all stayed inside for the rest of the day with automatic
                    weapon fire heard from time to time in the near-by streets. By late afternoon,
                    we were able to send the staff home — one car at a time.</p>
                <p>We later heard that the Ariana (Afghan airlines) plane our cousins were traveling
                    on had been diverted to Tehran. Four days later they arrived on the first
                    commercial plane to land at Kabul airport since the coup. We met them at the
                    airport and when they came down off the ramp there were two lines of soldiers on
                    each side with fixed bayonets. Our cousins thought it was great fun, and we had
                    a marvelous two weeks together.</p>
                <p>For the balance of the my stay in Afghanistan, President Daud was firmly in
                    control and we had no feeling of political instability. In fact, the government
                    was a bit more open to new ideas and a bit more vigorous. On the political side,
                    the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Bahktari, was a communist. He had been educated
                    at American University in the ''50s and became one there at that time. While we
                    were able to continue with our existing agricultural programs (albeit,
                    reluctantly), no new projects were initiated after his arrival.</p>
                <p>I (we) decided that it might help relations if we sent Minister Bahktari, back to
                    the states on a short term participant training visit.We arranged for him to
                    meet with the then Secretary of Agriculture, visit irrigation sites in the
                    Imperial Valley, the TVA etc. He had a wonderful time, drank himself silly on
                    weekends. When he got back, the first thing he did was to report to the Afghan
                    nation on what he had found in the US. He described the incredibly rich narrow
                    minority, and further explained that most American citizens were worse off than
                    the Afghan farmers in the rural areas. He was very proud of himself.
                    Fortunately, for us after a couple of years he made so many mistakes he was
                    removed by President Daud for incompetence. Moral of the Story: Perhaps it was a
                    bit naive to think that a “VIP” visit to our country would be enough to change
                    the point of view of a dedicated communist — especially one that had never been
                    to the USSR.President Daud's appointment as Minister of Plan, Mr. Khorram was
                    excellent. Within the limits of the local political realities, he did his best
                    to move things along. We got along very well. Unfortunately, a year after I
                    left, Minister Khorram was assassinated in front of the Planning Ministry
                    offices. In April of 1978, about six months later, President Daud was killed
                    during a violent coup d'etat. The new rulers organized a “Revolutionary Council,
                    suspended the constitution and initiated a program of “scientific
                    socialism”.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, much of the good work done during President Daud's reign was lost
                    when the Revolutionary Council took over.</p>

                    The Afghans, on the social side, were very “stand-offish” for the first year. We
                    gradually made a number of close Afghan friends. Our two boys loved it. They
                    learned Farsi and were often invited out into the country to visit with Afghan
                    families.</p>
                <p>Understanding the decision-making dynamics in Afghanistan was very demanding
                    because decisions often depended on tribal politics in the different regions,
                    and within the government structure who would benefit if a certain project was
                    approved. Most of the projects were well appreciated and were moving ahead —
                    albeit slowly.</p>
                <p>I remember one case where we had had an enthusiastic reception from the Governors
                    of Herat and Khandahar and local leaders to a proposal for a Rural Development
                    Project emphasizing village self-help. To help get it started we proposed most
                    of the AID financing to be on a grant basis including a portion of the local
                    financing. Most of the governments contribution was to be in the value of the
                    local labor furnished in the villages. Months went by and the Project Agreement
                    was not signed. The Minister of Plan indicated that although he supported the
                    project, he was helpless to get it approved at cabinet level. Washington was
                    about to deobligate the money. I had recently hired as my “cultural advisor”, an
                    ex-peace corps volunteer (Marti Kumorek), who spoke Farsi fluently and had many
                    contacts in the Afghan community on local contracI asked Marti to look into the
                    matter informally, and he found out that the opposition was purely political.
                    Certain members of the Cabinet did not want the Governors of Herat and Khandahar
                    to benefit from the project. Once I knew this, I was able to go to Ambassador
                    Eliot explain the situation. He was very helpful and spoke to President Daud,
                    who sorted it all out. Shortly afterward, the project agreement was signed. On a
                    number of occasions after that when the government was not reacting “logically”,
                    Marti was able to determine the reason, and help us work out a strategy to get
                    the project or new policy approved.</p>
                <p>In the Fall of 1976, I received an offer of a position with a five country
                    African Development Organization, “le Conseil de l'Entente”, in Abidjan as a
                    Development Counselor in charge of their loan and grant portfolio with the
                    English-speaking donors. I was needed in Abidjan by January 1977. So I decided
                    to retire from the Agency for International Development in the month of December
                    1976.</p>

                <p>Early Retirement (December 1976)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made you want to retire so soon? You must have been
                        in your early '50s when you retired.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: My reasons for retiring were multi-faceted. I was fifty two years old and
                    could have stayed with the Agency for another 10 years or so. With twenty/twenty
                    hindsight, I think one of the principal reasons was that in my over a quarter of
                    a century with AID the development business had become increasingly
                    bureaucratic, complicated and difficult — e.g., the design, approval, and
                    operation and evaluation of projects and programs.</p>
                <p>On the one hand AID, as it learned more about the development process, was more
                    and more sophisticated in its demands, e.g. AID was interested in participating
                    in multi-year development/stabilization plans with sophisticated evaluation and
                    other measurement requirements. On the other hand, levels of assistance were
                    being sharply reduced, particularly the levels of its bilateral aid programs. In
                    a number of countries, we were no longer the major donor.</p>
                <p>AID insisted on increasing the self-help efforts of recipients. Not a bad idea.
                    However, this was happening, in many cases, while we were turning over the
                    capital, non project and commodity assistance to multi-national organizations
                    and other donors. As our aid leverage was reduced, our program demands in the
                    developing countries had become much more complex and time consuming .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there really a change in the way you did business over
                        the years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, and it was significant. When I first joined the Marshall Plan in
                    1950, I worked at the Marshall Plan's European headquarters in Paris (ORS), I
                    remember writing up a technical assistance project for $1.5 million to help
                    facilitate the immigration of German, Austrian and Italian refugees to Latin
                    America using the International Labor Organization (ILO) as the executing Agency
                    on one page and a half. Approval took all of one week. The project was
                    successfully executed by the ILO in a minimum amount of time and cost.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Some of the changes in the way we do our development business were indeed
                    necessary. For example, requiring project proposals to include measurable goals,
                    and requiring evaluation of project performance was very useful. Detailed
                    implementation plans and evaluation plans were only sporadically required in the
                    ''50s and ''60s. However, these reasonable steps turned out to be insufficient.
                    During the Vietnam war years, the political and military expediencies which led
                    to abuses in executing AID managed development programs, led to a number of
                    additional, onerous, paper and reporting requirements. Unfortunately, because of
                    Congressional pressures many of these requirements were applied world wide.
                    While some of them might well have been necessary in the Vietnam case, there was
                    no reason to add the resulting administrative burden to the remaining 90% of the
                    USAIDs which had not experienced the Vietnam abuses. Further, all of these
                    additional administrative burdens and restrictions were coming at a time when
                    the US aid programs were being substantially reduced in size. As mentioned
                    above, at the same time that we were requiring overall multi year development
                    and economic stabilization plans as a condition for our assistance, our total
                    aid efforts to the developing countries were diminishing. In addition, the
                    capital projects component had been spun off to such organizations as the World
                    Bank(IBRD), and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Was financial remuneration a consideration in your decision
                        to retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I don't think it was a major consideration, but in real terms my salary as
                    an FSR-1 (the highest rank) adjusted for inflation had decreased in value since
                    1964 due to salary caps by Congress. In addition, I was reminded in 1976 by the
                    AID Administrator that as a Director ( a political appointee of the President),
                    I could be removed at anytime; and should this happen, I would not automatically
                    be reinstated into the career service. It looked like a form letter that went to
                    all executive appointees. While I wasn't unduly worried, this kind of
                    correspondence did little to increase my desire to hang on; rather it encouraged
                    me to retire at the first opportunity.</p>
                <p>Would I be able to afford to send my children through university if I remained
                    with AID was another consideration? Fortunately, counting my military service, I
                    had almost 30 years of Federal government service, all of which applied toward
                    my retirement annuity. As a Foreign Service officer, I became eligible at 50
                    years of age and twenty years of service. I was aware that after my retirement,
                    I would be able to draw my pension, plus my salary in the private sector, e.g.
                    amounts earned as a contract employee in private sector consulting firm. In
                    addition, if I spent adequate time working in the private sector and paying my
                    share of social security, I would be eligible for Social Security payments at
                    the age of 65 in addition to my State Department annuity.</p>

                        the international field. Could you tell a little bit about that
                        experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I remained in internationally related work for the next 15 years.
                    Essentially it was in three phases: 1) my service with the Entente Fund based in
                    Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), a little less than 2 years; 2) a position
                    as head of the International Department for my church based in Boston, 4 years;
                    and 3) work as an management member and team leader on evaluation and project
                    design teams and as contract manager for contracts carried out by consulting
                    firms working with AID, 10 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like working for the Entente Fund , I
                        understand that your headquarters were in Abidjan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: The Entente fund was an inter-governmental organization composed of five
                    sub-Saharan African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast),
                    Togo, and Niger which had banded together to facilitate their economic
                    cooperation, and to a lesser degree political cooperation in areas of common
                    interest. The Secretary General of the Entente Fund, was Paul Kaya, from
                    Senegal, who had his doctorate in statistics from the Sorbonne in France. He was
                    a brilliant man, and very personable. His Board of Directors were the Presidents
                    of the five countries. He had a very small staff and a comfortable office in
                    downtown Abidjan. All five of the Entente Fund countries had contributed to a
                    common fund which earned interest. The operating expenses of the secretariat
                    were financed from interest earned by the fund. Most of the projects were paid
                    for by direct additional assessments to the country(s) participating in the
                    development project.All of Dr. Kaya's development advisors (4) were expatriates.
                    His main advisor/managers came from the French technical assistance program (3)
                    (mainly in public administration, agriculture and finance). They were
                    responsible for the multi-country projects financed by the French government and
                    any other francophone country. I was responsible for the USAID financed
                    multi-country projects in the private sector, and agriculture, as well as any
                    other projects financed by English speaking countries. The Entente Fund's USAID
                    portfolio was about $10 million. Within the Entente fund, the operational
                    language was French, so I worked in French. As part of my duties, I recruited
                    the American contract personnel, wrote their contracts, and purchased whatever
                    material and supplies were needed using letters of credit. I traveled to the
                    five countries to monitor the progress of our projects. My many years in AID
                    help immeasurably in doing this, since all of the financial documentation had to
                    meet AID standards and procedures as well as the Entente fund requirements.</p>
                <p>The original Entente Fund advisor I replaced was also a retired AID employee. His
                    name was Bob Minges and he had been a Mission Director. My USAID contact office
                    in Abidjan was REDSO/West. Miles Wedeman was the REDSO Director at that
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>After almost two years in Abidjan, I was asked to take up a position as head of
                    the International Department of my church and I accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mandate as head of the International
                        Department Head of your church (1978-1982)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: By way of background I should mention that The First Church of Christ,
                    Scientist in Boston Massachusetts was founded in America at the end of the 19th
                    century. It publishes the Christian Science Monitor, a daily newspaper known
                    around the world. While most of its members live in the US, a number of churches
                    had been established abroad — in about 50 countries around the world. The
                    International Department was organized in the late 1960s because our church's
                    headquarters staff had little or no knowledge of the different cultural settings
                    and the needs of the congregations abroad. The mandate of my department was to
                    help the staff in understanding the particular requirements of our overseas
                    churches, and how to communicate with them more effectively. At headquarters, I
                    managed four staffers each specializing in a specific region, i.e. Europe, Asia,
                    Latin America and Africa. In addition there were four overseas representatives
                    under my supervision — one representative for each continent. They were based
                    overseas, and visited the churches and societies in the countries in their
                    areas. It was a fascinating job. After several years, the Board of Directors
                    decided that the church's line departments should deal directly with overseas
                    churches rather than a staff office, so I stayed on an extra year to dissolve
                    the international department and integrate its work into the line
                    departments.</p>
                <p>We lived in Lexington, Massachusetts and loved it. Our daughter Valerie was in
                    high school, our second son Greg was at Occidental College in Southern
                    California, and our oldest son Chris was working on his doctorate in economics
                    at the Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy based on the Tufts Campus in the
                    Boston area.</p>
                <p>When my work at the church was drawing to an end, I took a one day course on “how
                    to become a consultant”. It turned out to be very helpful. One of the pieces of
                    advice was to contact your previous employer about consulting work, if your work
                    experience had been good. There was a good chance that he might need some “short
                    term” help</p>
                <p>When I retired from the Agency for International Development we were on excellent
                    terms. So, I went back to Washington, DC to see if the Agency might need some
                    help. I presented my curriculum vitae to a number of Consulting firms which were
                    providing services to AID and was soon hired.</p>
                <p>

                <p>BROWN: It was hard at first. Some assignments were back to back so I was away
                    from home two to three months at a time.My first job was an assessment of the
                    REDSO/West project to provide assistance to ECOWAS (The Economic Community for
                    West African States) which had offices in Lagos, Nigeria and Lome, Togo. Next I
                    was hired to manage a project whose job was to inventory, assess, and recommend
                    closer coordination in the agricultural research efforts of the West African
                    states. We worked with the Research departments of the West African states, as
                    well as the principal donors: France, UK, UN, FAO, etc. I spent a considerable
                    amount of time in Senegal and Mali working with the African secretariat set up
                    to coordinate the work. After that I served as management member and team leader
                    on a number of evaluations of the Child Survival Primary Health Care projects in
                    Africa being carried out in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO)
                    by the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. I also was
                    involved in the design and evaluation of a number of Family Planning projects
                    (bilateral and regional), worldwide and in Africa. In the early '90s I was
                    project coordinator (under contract) of a small group of specialists which
                    provided logistic support for the AID regional office dealing with the
                    university community at large, and more specifically with the Association of
                    Universities, mainly in the South which serve the African American Community.
                    These universities had been very active in carrying out research in field of
                    agriculture. We organized and managed a number of seminars for AID bringing
                    together representatives of the university community committed to helping
                    developing countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an ex USAID Director, was it hard not being in charge,
                        or having others to carry out the work for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: Actually, I found certain aspects easier. When one directs a large USAID,
                    there are a myriad of decisions to be taken from administration to program, to
                    policy on many activities — technical assistance, participant training, capital
                    projects, commodity assistance, loans and grants, joint financing, personnel
                    management, annual budgets, evaluations, relations with the Embassy, Country
                    Team, other donors, international organizations, bilateral donors, etc. The
                    amount of time available to spend on any one subject has to be budgeted,
                    prioritized and shared.</p>
                <p>When one is consulting, the assignment is usually limited to designing a single
                    project, or evaluating an existing project or program. While the project or
                    program may be very complex and sometimes involving a worldwide project, the
                    design or assessment is usually a team effort with several weeks to visit the
                    site(s), interview the practitioners and recipients, and write the report. One
                    can concentrate ones intellectual effort on a specific target. While this may
                    require a significant effort over a limited period of time, the objectives of
                    the mission, or terms of reference are usually well defined.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any observations you'd like to make as one who was often a
                        Team Leader charged with producing the final report? For example, the
                        challenge of making the evaluation recommendations or project design
                        practical, useful and reasonably user friendly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I understand what you mean. Too often one hears of “evaluation” reports
                    languishing in the bottom drawer of the host country or USAID officer's
                    desk.</p>
                <p>I found that the Team Leader's job was two fold: first, to assure that the
                    evaluation was carried out effectively including the development of sensible
                    recommendations for improvement, and second, presenting the conclusions in such
                    a way that they could be acted on and the hurdles slowing the progress of a
                    project overcome. While not always easy, the least difficult part in evaluating
                    a project or program was to come up with sensible recommendations and /or
                    conclusions to improve project performance, break-up long jams, solve serious
                    problems, etc. The hardest part was getting the recommendations, first, accepted
                    and then implemented. It was in no one's interest to be highly critical without
                    suggesting solutions, or to write up “theoretically correct” answers to problems
                    that were beyond the resources and/or capacities of the those responsible for
                    the project to carry out. In addition to making positive recommendations for
                    improvement, another important aspect of the evaluation team's job was to help
                    those charged with executing the project to “bite-the -bullet”, and take the
                    hard decisions necessary to move the project forward. Of course, no two project
                    evaluations or project design assignments were alike. All of these aspects made
                    the consulting work challenging and rewarding.</p>
                <p>Another significant plus for me in working with private consulting firms
                    servicing USAID and its host countries, and in managing AID financed contracts
                    into the early '90s was that it allowed me to keep up to date with the evolution
                    of AID's development/performance based policies and operating procedures. These
                    experiences, plus a quarter of a century of work as an AID manager, provide the
                    foundation or backdrop for the observations which follow.</p>
                <p>Lessons learned and US foreign assistance — a 45 year perspective</p>
                <p>The following are a summary of my views on the success of the foreign assistance
                    program and lessons learned based on my experiences as a Technical Assistance
                    Specialist working with the OEEC, Washington Desk Officer, Program Officer in
                    the field, USAID Director, and Management Consultant/Evaluation Team Leader from
                    1950 to the present. My field experience was mainly in Europe, Africa, the Far
                    East and South East Asia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did foreign assistance in the short run and the long run
                        make a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BROWN: Yes, I believe it made a significant difference worldwide. The Marshall
                    Plan, of course, was a resounding success, and saved literally millions of
                    lives. However, most of my comments below deal with the effect of foreign
                    assistance on the developing, or third world countries. Even the most ardent
                    critics would have to admit that US foreign assistance, especially the emergency
                    food and related assistance has saved literally thousands of lives in countries
                    such as Egypt, Sudan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Ecuador, Guatemala,
                    Bangladesh (to name a few) from life threatening natural disasters —
                    earthquakes, floods, lack of rain, civil wars, etc. In addition, we have
                    eradicated some diseases like polio, reduced the incidence of others such as
                    measles and other communicable diseases, and brought fertility rates down in all
                    parts of the world, even in countries like Haiti and Bangladesh where there has
                    been little economic growth.</p>
                <p>One might ask, “At what cost to the US taxpayer”? As AID Administrator after
                    Administrator over the years have tried to explain to Congress and the American
                    Public, almost all of the US foreign assistance moneys expended to buy surplus
                    food (wheat, edible oil, rice, etc.), vitally needed equipment, expert help,
                    transport, build roads and dams, reconstruct ports have been spent in the United
                    States because of the stringent “buy American” policy, i.e., be it materials,
                    equipment, or contract services.Therefore, it can be argued that in addition to
                    the clear benefit to the developing countries receiving our foreign assistance,
                    the aid program has been good for the US economy, created jobs, etc.</p>
                <p>In the longer term, definitely South Korea would not have made it economically in
                    near record time, if it had not been for our economic and technical support.
                    South Korea is also an important trading partner. Argentina, Chili and Brazil
                    received substantial help from the US before going off of the USAID roles for
                    all practical purposes. Pakistan (at least up until recently) and Bangladesh,
                    while still AID recipient countries, both received tremendous boosts in the
                    production of food from the USAID program, not to mention improvements in public
                    administration, public health, education, and private sector development,
                    infrastructure maintenance, etc.</p>
                <p>While there has been some progress in the area of family planning., generally
                    speaking we have been less successful in promoting this activity. The population
                    growth in most developing countries has been well over 2.5% to 3.0%, which means
                    that populations have doubled in 20 years or less. In countries like Pakistan
                    and Bangladesh over the last 30 years many of the gains from increased
                    agricultural/food production have been characterized by temporary food
                    surpluses, only to be wiped out over the years by population increases.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Generally speaking, while the funding levels for AID have gone down dramatically
                    over the last several years, in the '90s the USAID Director has had at his
                    disposal an impressive array of development tools ranging from the traditional
                    help in the fields of agriculture, education, industry, infrastructure, to
                    activities such as stabilization programs, long term low interest rate loans, PL
                    480 foods, democracy programs, crisis management, rural development and small
                    farmer credit, evaluation techniques, etc. In the '90s, some USAID programs are
                    assisting the developing countries become more efficient (and catch up) in the
                    use of new technologies, e.g., the world of computers, electronically assisted
                    management systems, etc.</p>
                <p>To sum up, US foreign assistance has made an important difference for millions
                    throughout the world over the last 50 years, and continues to demonstrate its
                    effectiveness in both the short and long term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How has Program Management changed over the years? Any
                        advice based on your experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: USAID's have gone from staffing composed almost entirely of direct-hire
                    employees in the ''60s, to most USAID services carried out largely by contract
                    employees supervised by a minimal number of direct-hire generalists. As
                    mentioned earlier, Nigeria was a proving ground for the use of university
                    contracts and other contracts to provide technical and other developmental
                    services. Its success helped lead the way for sharp reductions in direct hire
                    employees on AID projects. However, in the late '80s and '90s AID has been
                    forced to go to the extreme of contracting out most jobs, and severely limiting
                    the number of direct-hire career employees left to administer the contracts.
                    This understaffing has led to cases where USAIDs have not always been able to
                    monitor and guide its contractors sufficiently, thus leading to crises which
                    might have been avoided given adequate staffing.</p>
                <p>In the '70s USAID staffing was much better balanced between contract and direct
                    hire staff.The USAID Director in a major aid mission, apart from the basic
                    direct hire support staff, would have resident qualified professional personnel
                    in the major fields of development activity — e.g., agriculture/environment,
                    engineering/capital development, education, public administration, management
                    systems, private sector development, public health including family planning and
                    emergency programs (including food). These direct hire professional skills made
                    the monitoring and use of contracts (Universities, NGOs/PVOs, consulting firms,
                    etc.) more effective.</p>
                <p>Of course, not every USAID has major programs in all of these fields. In a
                    smaller USAID mission the Director, in addition to his generalists, should be
                    able to call on regional technical support services for expertise in the areas
                    mentioned above — perhaps something along the lines of those supplied for Africa
                    by REDSO/West in Abidjan and REDSO/East in Nairobi.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>It would not take a major increase in resources to redress this staffing
                    imbalance and re-approach the staffing that many USAID Directors in major
                    countries had in the 1970s. If such an increase were to be carried out and a
                    select number of professional direct hire staff added in the major USAID
                    missions, it would assure better program monitoring, project design, and promote
                    more effectively sustained contact and continuity with the host government's
                    self-help activities. Continuity and experience are important in a USAID. The
                    “know-how” and experience demonstrated by career oriented direct-hire employees
                    is much harder to assure under contract financed activities in which the
                    personnel tend to rotate each time a contract is renewed. It might, in the
                    longer run, prove more cost effective to supply these skills through
                    direct-hires than by contracts.</p>
                <p>In making the above suggestion, I am well aware that “OE” (Operating Expenditure)
                    funds are much harder to come by than “Program Funds” which are used for
                    contracts. This is a time of “smaller government”, etc. To sum up, my premise is
                    that the few additional professional direct- hires in the key development fields
                    for each major USAID mission would actually save money overall by more effective
                    use of Program Funds even if a small increase in OE funds were required.</p>
                <p>So what about the future? Certainly, the moral, economic, social and security
                    reasons for helping the developing world progress remain today, just as they did
                    forty to fifty years ago. The end of the cold war has not diminished this global
                    need. Over 80% of the world's population is in the third world.</p>
                <p>The Agency for International Development (AID) has developed over the years an
                    impressive “know-how” — an array of projects, programs, implementation and
                    evaluation techniques. This kit of tools, properly applied, along with adequate
                    resources, can rise to the developmental challenges, and continue to move the
                    third world countries forward.</p>
                <p>Having reaffirmed my conviction in the Agency's ability to make a difference and
                    help meet a serious global need, there are still some serious hurdles and
                    pitfalls to overcome. I believe that AID, along with the rest of the donors in
                    the development community, is a relatively novice in designing programs to
                    reduce or avoid social/ethnic and political instability. More applied research,
                    pilot projects and programs are needed in this area.</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, as we assist, push and cajole the developing countries to
                    move toward efficient free market economies (private sector programs, economic
                    stabilization agreements, mullet-donor consortiums, etc.), there is a dire need
                    to be able to determine more accurately the domestic social, and political
                    climate, be better informed on the do's and don'ts, the 'what works and what
                    doesn't'.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>A word of caution is in order. For any successful development program it is a
                    question of balance. If we add a political dimension, it should in no way
                    diminish the importance of the economic and social factors i.e., stabilization
                    agreements, capital projects, non-project assistance, private sector
                    initiatives, community development, self-help efforts, PL 480 resources, etc.
                    Given the diverse and dynamic nature of developmental challenges, there is no
                    single approach to successful development — unfortunately there is no easy
                    panacea.</p>
                <p>To a degree, AID has been hampered over the years by focusing on one dimensional
                    approaches to enhance social and economic development rather than mullet-faceted
                    approaches. In the ''50s, the hope was that technical assistance (transfer of
                    know-how) alone would do the job. Then in the ''60s there was a focus on capital
                    development projects. Capital development officers and programs were prioritized
                    to the detriment of the technical assistance efforts. Again in the ''70s and
                    ''80s, private sector initiatives were the “rage”, and private sector officers
                    replaced capital development officers. In the '90s, the Agency's strong emphasis
                    appears to be on democracy programs/community development, crisis management,
                    etc., which has led to the diminution of private sector initiatives and
                    staff.</p>
                <p>As already stated, experience has shown that there is no quick “one dimensional
                    panacea”.When program elements are interrelated and a multi-faceted approach is
                    used, together they often produce synergistic results. To give one example: If
                    one improves agricultural production, in addition to growing more product per
                    acre, to sustain and build on this success, one also needs to consider farm to
                    market transport, available markets, export as well as domestic demand,
                    continued availability of foreign exchange for imports of fertilizers,
                    pesticides and equipment, as well as agricultural credit, coops for small
                    farmers, etc. etc.</p>
                <p>One of the most dramatic cases of what can happen when only one factor is
                    addressed in an economy occurred in the early days of the Marshall Plan in
                    Turkey (late 1940s until early '50s) Dr. Elmer Starch, who was the head of the
                    Agriculture Division of the aid mission in Turkey during this period told me the
                    following. (Dr. Starch went on to head Agricultural Development programs for
                    both AID and the World Bank.)</p>
                <p>The US mission's agricultural extension agents working with the Turkish
                    Agricultural Ministry were very successful in introducing new wheat seeds, plus
                    fertilizers, pesticides and better farming technics, etc. They a achieved a 50%
                    increase in production in a remarkably short time. However, during the early
                    years, much of the increase in wheat production rotted at the farms. The farmers
                    had out-produced local demand, and no transport or marketing system was
                    available to get the grain to the urban areas, and when this problem was solved
                    even the urban demand was saturated. Wheat exports in the short term were not
                    possible, since the Turkish ports were not constructed to handle the export of
                    grain, even though there was a demand overseas. It took several years to solve
                    these problems. Fortunately, during the Marshall plan, US foreign assistance was
                    available to help Turkey meet these multi-faceted challenges.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>There is another aspect which should be considered in achieving a successful
                    country development program. It is one that both helps and hinders the putting
                    together of the “perfect” assistance package. Most major country assistance
                    programs are made up of a “collage” of different donors, depending upon the
                    circumstances, from the UN ( and its subsidiaries UNICEF, World Food Program,
                    etc.), the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, to the interested bilateral
                    donor countries. The mix of assistance in the aid package often depends on the
                    interests of the various donor countries making up the consortium. Also, any
                    program to be successful must take into account the realities of the host
                    country's ability (desire) to do its share of self-help, plus the economic,
                    social and political effects of the programs proposed in both the short and long
                    term. In a number of third world countries, through the use of host country
                    sponsored donor assistance committees, AID has shown considerable creativity in
                    getting interested donors to contribute the maximum in those areas they have
                    been interested. Then the US assistance funds could be used to finance help in
                    critical areas not covered by other donor financing.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, one of the important lessons here is that in planning future development
                    programs for countries like Zaire, Haiti, Rwanda, Burundi, Angola, Afghanistan,
                    etc., equal consideration (repeat equal not preponderant) should be given to
                    political as well as economic development aspects of these programs. The skills
                    of political scientists, anthropologists, educators, sociologists should be
                    called upon and given equal standing with the economists, financial experts,
                    engineers, technicians, and management specialists.</p>
                <p>Last, but not least, we need to design these programs so that the progress, or
                    lack of it can be measured/evaluated , and the necessary corrective measures
                    taken. Evaluation reports should always be followed up to assure that the
                    pertinent recommendations are carried out.As one who has been the team leader on
                    a number of evaluation teams, 50% of the job is determining what is needed, and
                    the other 50% of the “successful” evaluation is in convincing the decision
                    makers to carry out the team's recommendation. Experience has shown that
                    although evaluations are necessary, they costs money, and are easier said than
                    done.</p>
                <p>To sum up, there is no single “magic wand”, or theme which will handle all
                    development problems. Life is more complicated than that. It is a question of
                    achieving the proper balance between the relevant inputs so that the individual
                    country being helped, can move ahead with all the bases covered — economic,
                    social, and political.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Emergency Assistance Programs/Disaster Response
                        activities of the Agency effective? What are some of the lessons
                        learned?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BROWN: In all of the developing countries I served in we had occasion to use PL
                    480 based programs both for emergency feeding programs connected with natural
                    disasters (earthquakes, droughts, floods, civil disorders disrupting
                    agricultural production). Also, the $25,000 available at the Ambassador's
                    discretion in emergencies has enabled the USAID to respond quickly. While very
                    helpful, the $25,000 used to meet today's emergencies is the same amount that
                    was available when I retired from AID in 1976. The ceiling for this kind of
                    quick action should be raised at least to $100,000 — to keep up with inflation
                    if nothing else.</p>
                <p>PL 480 Titles I, II and III programs have also provided much needed resources for
                    a host of emergency and development based activities. Sales of PL 480
                    commodities have produced counterpart funds which could later be used for a
                    whole gamut of emergency and develop based activities. These programs have added
                    greatly to the kit of humanitarian and economic assistance tools available to
                    the USAID Director. They have been very used very successfully and innovatively
                    over the years.</p>
                <p>One of the areas of difficulty that still exists, I gather, is the time lag
                    between the quick response in emergencies and the transition period after the
                    immediate crisis has past. To design and start the implementation of a
                    development project can easily take from 18 months minimum to several years.
                    This has often created a hiatus between the end of the short term emergency
                    assistance and the urgent need for follow-on projects to help the rural or urban
                    area get on its feet again, e.g., rebuild and recommence production.</p>
                <p>While I have not been directly involved, I've been impressed by the recent
                    activities of the Office of Transition Initiatives in the Bureau for
                    Humanitarian Response. This is a small office of senior officers who have the
                    mandate to ferret out projects, during times of crisis when timing is urgent,
                    and assist in overcoming the bureaucratic hurdles and red tape in their approval
                    and implementation. I understand this office was very helpful in the case of
                    Haiti in moving certain critical projects which were needed to support the
                    fledgling democracy through the approval process in record time. With the full
                    support of the Administrator, this office has been able to help move selected
                    projects through the Agency and gain quick approval and implementation.</p>
                <p>I should mention one danger with feeding programs is that they take on a life of
                    their own. That they are not just their during the “emergency”, but they become
                    straight feeding programs year after year.In the early years in Tunisia, we
                    tried very hard to relate our programs to developmental improvements. For
                    example, our food for work program produced simple farm to market roads, simple
                    rock dams/dikes to slow the run off water during the rainy season, terracing to
                    keep the arable land from being swept away with each downpour. In more recent
                    years, I've noted the use of food in Maternal/Child/Health (MCH) programs to get
                    mothers to participate in vaccination, deworming, family planning programs,
                    etc.. The public health impact of these programs has been to reduce basic
                    malnutrition in the population.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The following comment is in no way designed to take away from the wonderful work
                    done by PVOs in the past, and the much needed work they are doing today. The
                    following suggestion is much more in the spirit of how can we improve the use of
                    an important aid input — food.</p>
                <p>In almost all of the emerging countries in which I've worked (Tunisia, Zaire,
                    South Korea, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc.) and many others I've visited, the
                    Private Voluntary Organizations (Catholic Relief, Church World Services, CARE,
                    etc.) have been helping meet feeding requirements with USAID paying for much of
                    the cost of their operations in food and funding. However, it seems to me that
                    their modus operandi has changed very little in thirty seven years — since the
                    1960s. While the major PVOs seem to have really mastered the logistics side very
                    well, there may have been a tendency to rest on their laurels and do the same
                    feeding programs over and over. Contract awards have become fairly automatic and
                    routine over the years, and they are not necessarily based on competition.</p>
                <p>As we go into the 21st century, it might be wise to seriously reexamine our
                    feeding programs around the world to be sure that they are using the food to
                    provide ways to help the clients get off of welfare, or improve the level of
                    health so that they are more productive, or learn about family planning so that
                    rate of increase in population is reduced, etc. Currently, there are examples of
                    very creative, developmental uses of food for these purposes, but they appear to
                    be in the minority.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, one idea that might be explored is to not only have “feeding”
                    contracts require a developmental dimension, but to have them competed — even if
                    just amongst PVOs. To sum up, I think the Agency can be very proud of its track
                    record of success in the rapid deployment of assistance. The Office of Foreign
                    Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is well run, focused, and not tied up in “red tape”
                    as the other parts of AID. The Agency has a well documented history of almost
                    always being the first one to respond to a disaster, and in being the one whose
                    presence always makes a significant difference in lives saved. Given the success
                    of this activity AID should continue to encourage USAIDs to take the disaster
                    relief function seriously, and to offer training to mission disaster relief
                    officers who have never done the job before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think of the recent emphasis on conflict
                        resolution and the installation of “democracy/ decentralization programs”.
                        Have they been effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I agree fully that there is a need for these kinds of programs. As
                    mentioned in some detail above in discussing some of our shortcomings in Zaire,
                    and Nigeria programs, until recently the Agency had done very little to take
                    into account the extremely volatile political climates in many of the countries
                    in the design of the country development program.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>It is hard to evaluate how effective they have been to date. Where they have been
                    used as an excuse for eliminating or severely reducing the economic, social,
                    environmental, private sector, economic stabilization programs found in most
                    major development programs, the overall long term effect may have been
                    counterproductive. As stated earlier, it is rather a question of finding the
                    right balance of inputs needed for the host country to move ahead. The exact mix
                    will, of course, vary country by country according to the interlocking economic,
                    social, and political factors.</p>
                <p>One aspect this area of “political thrust”, is the absolute need for the USAID
                    Director to be a team player. In my judgment, if the cooperation on the country
                    team under the leadership of the Ambassador is effective, USAID resources can be
                    effectively blended into the effort to establish the emerging country on a
                    stable footing. To put it another way, the economic development effort should
                    not be judged as independent from the political, but as a very important part of
                    the overall team effort in which political stability is also one of the
                    requirements for economic and social development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AID is always hoping that more countries, sooner rather
                        than later, will be graduating from the AID roles. What about the past and
                        future record?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: In the recent past many countries have been taken off AID roles — perhaps
                    20 to 30. However, it is not clear how many of those recent alumni who left
                    “school” really graduated. Countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Chili,
                    Brazil, Mexico, etc. do appear to have turned the corner. The record shows that
                    as these countries have graduated and grown economically, they have shown
                    themselves to be better trading partners for the US.</p>
                <p>Looking at the question regionally, it would appear that Europe (leaving aside
                    the old USSR) , Japan, the Far East, South East Asia, the Middle East and the
                    Caribbean/South America have made it, or are moving in the right direction with
                    occasional exceptions here and there. It is perhaps of interest that most people
                    visiting Vietnam today can't help observe how much more dynamic the South is
                    compared to North. It would appear that the US foreign assistance efforts to
                    strengthen the economy of the South were successful and the benefits continue
                    today,</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The remaining continent with extreme economic/social/political problems requiring
                    sustained long term assistance is Africa — especially sub-Saharan Africa.
                    Economic and social progress appears to be moving backwards rather than forward.
                    Any serious attempt to help the African continent sort out its problems will
                    need to be flexible and innovative. It should not only include democracy
                    building and crisis management, but long term help in education is crucial. US
                    foreign assistance (along with other national and international donors) should
                    also include private sector development programs, family planning and primary
                    health care. In addition, as production increases, there will be a need for
                    infrastructure inputs of major proportion for inter-country roads, farm to
                    market roads, port facilities, communications, electric power and other forms of
                    energy, etc. It is not likely that any country will graduate in the immediate
                    future — 25 to 50 years is a more reasonable time frame. Apart from South
                    Africa, which is a special case, given proper support, countries like Zimbabwe
                    and the Ivory Coast, where modernization is already under way, might be able to
                    turn the corner and graduate in the next fifteen to twenty five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What has been the effect of the interaction of US
                        political security interests and evolving development strategy over the
                        years? Was it mutually supporting or compromising to development
                        efforts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: There is no precise, statistical answer to this question. Certainly most
                    of those countries which received substantial economic/humanitarian assistance
                    because of the cold war, were benefitted. However, the strategic interests have
                    always had a significant impact on the results of the aid agency. For example,
                    the Vietnam war consumed a lion's share of the foreign assistance resources for
                    17 or 18 years, taking away from other developing countries much needed
                    technical and material assistance.</p>
                <p>Ever since the signing of the Israel/Egypt peace agreement some 60 to 70% of the
                    AID budget has gone to those two countries, of the 30 or 40% remaining, most of
                    the balance has gone by priority to assist “cold war” and post-cold war
                    countries. The enormous needs for our neighbors to the South and for the African
                    continent have been second or third priority. While it makes sense to link US
                    assistance to our national security goals and concerns, on balance the need to
                    provide assistance for essentially political/strategic purposes has not always
                    led to the best use of our funds from an economic/social development
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>Now that the cold war is over the criteria for allocation of resources should be
                    carefully reviewed and new criteria and priorities developed to meet the new
                    situation. President Clinton often refers to getting our nation ready for the
                    21st Century. The US foreign assistance strategy, priorities and estimates of
                    resources required need to be overhauled in light of the new world
                    situation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think is the most urgent problem facing
                        developing countries today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: I'm convinced that it is getting their population growth under control —
                    especially in Africa. I realize that this is a politically charged subject both
                    in the US and in the developing world, but the I believe the seriousness of the
                    problem is indisputable. Most developing countries whether in Africa, Asia or
                    South America have populations that are doubling every twenty years or so. Even
                    in the few developing countries with increases in agricultural and industrial
                    production which match their population's annual increase, there is little or no
                    hope that they will be able to keep up with increased demand for food; the
                    infrastructure needs for their populations in the fields of: transport (buses,
                    trains, internal airlines, major roads, farm to market roads, etc.); public
                    health — hospitals, primary health care facilities, vaccination programs, public
                    health information programs; and education: overcrowded (sometimes non-existent)
                    primary schools, limited secondary education not to mention increased demand for
                    higher education geared to modern times. The population age profile in most of
                    the LDCs shows that more than 50% of the people are under 15 or 16 years of
                    age.</p>
                <p>Looking to the 21st Century , the outlook is grim, particularly for Africa. With
                    the rapid growth in communications, technology and the transport of hi
                    tech/mechanized factories to the third world countries, the demand for manual,
                    unskilled labor is diminishing rapidly. In many third world countries even in
                    the field of agriculture, many hi tech solutions are being applied. While the
                    need for skilled workers in LDCs on the increase, the demand for unskilled
                    services is declining rapidly. Increases in productivity, and production are
                    helpful, they are no match for the dramatic increase in the LDC populations.</p>
                <p>Drastic action is needed: leaders of the developing world need to be aware of the
                    sinister economic, social, and political implications of run-away populations if
                    they aren't checked. It is in the interest of the developed world to help solve
                    this problem. While there are a number of good examples of economic progress in
                    Asia, and Latin America, the probability is that these economic advances will be
                    wiped out on a per capita income basis by the unbridled population growth in
                    these countries. Just think what would have happened in China, if they had not
                    controlled their growth rate. If they had not adopted very stringent measures,
                    China would have a population of 3 billion Chinese today instead of 1.5
                    billion.The technology for controlling the population problem is available:
                    contraceptives, extended breast feeding, morning after pills, lowering of child
                    mortality, condoms, etc. The crux of the problem lies in the cultural and social
                    perception of family planning (birth control) — not only in the LDCs, but in the
                    US as well. It is the political difficulties and scarce resources, rather than
                    the technical know-how which is slowing down the worldwide reduction of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand the seriousness of the population problem,
                        but what can one government Agency (USAID, for example) realistically do
                        about it? The political, social and religious obstacles to utilizing the
                        full range of technical solutions you mentioned are enormous.</hi>

                <p>BROWN: That's right! The hurdles are extremely high, but so are the stakes for
                    the world (including the US), especially if the population in the developing
                    world continues to double every 20 years.I don't think there is any quick fix.
                    However, the developed world can and needs to do more to help now. More
                    financial and skilled resources as well as equipment and supplies are needed to
                    solve this problem, preferably with a minimum of strings attached to their
                    use.</p>
                <p>Step by step progress can be made if the global and national implications of this
                    problem continue to be brought to the attention of the leaders of third world
                    countries, as well as the leaders of the developed world including the US. For
                    example, although in general the male dominated Muslim world tends to be against
                    family planning (birth control), in Egypt a number of the Muslim clerical
                    leaders have supported it — especially those from the urban areas. Perhaps they
                    could be enlisted to help convince Mullahs and Imams from other countries. In
                    the early '70s, our USAID mission sent a team of Afghan Mullahs (priests) to
                    Cairo, to meet with their counterparts and discuss family planning and its
                    compatibility with Islam. We got mixed results. The better educated Afghan
                    Muslim mullahs from the urban areas endorsed family planning, and those from the
                    rural areas (generally the least educated) were against it.</p>
                <p>Several years ago, under one of the AID family planning projects, the leaders in
                    Nigeria, received a candid briefing about the damaging economic and social
                    impact of their country's “three percent plus” population growth rate. As a
                    result, the leaders were brought around to support a vigorous contraceptive and
                    condom program which included television advertising on prime time
                    television.</p>
                <p>Even in developing countries with strong religious and social mores against use
                    of contraceptives (birth control), there are measures that can be taken such as
                    extending the breast feeding time of mother's and their children. This not only
                    leads to healthier mothers and babies, it delays pregnancies and as a
                    consequence leads to fewer children.Over time, significant progress in slowing
                    the population growth in the developing world, would diminish significantly the
                    population pressures — ergo, lower the need for developmental and emergency food
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served over ten years of your career in Africa? Many
                        African countries seem to be lagging behind the rest of the developing
                        world. Would you like to comment?</hi>

                <p>BROWN:The sub-Saharan countries are generally starting way behind the goal line.
                    Most of the infrastructure is limited — i.e., sea ports are inadequate, there is
                    a shortage of roads, especially between African countries, and the few railroads
                    that exist link the seacoast with the interior, but not between countries.
                    Perhaps more important is the lacuna in the field of education — literacy rates
                    continue to be less than 50% in many countries. There are a critical lack of
                    educational facilities for the burgeoning population, not to mention lack of
                    primary health care facilities. Illiteracy is a big problem, in teaching new
                    techniques and technology. In addition, electric power and telephone facilities
                    are clearly antiquated and inadequate. Many of the sub-Saharan countries were
                    colonized late in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and the colonial powers
                    really did not get around to installing adequate road systems, ports, railroads,
                    etc., before independence was granted by after World War II.</p>
                <p>To put it candidly, over the last twenty five years, African leadership has not
                    always been up to the task of managing their countries limited resources, and
                    corruption has been and continues to be a major problem. Mobutu's corrupt, 35
                    year reign in Zaire which just ended, is a case. As, natural resource wise, the
                    richest country in sub-Saharan Africa, Zaire is an extreme case in point. Based
                    on its wonderful natural resource base, Zaire should be one of the riches
                    countries in Africa. Today, it is one of the poorest. It is not clear that life
                    will be better under the new leader, Kabila, who is a known Marxist.</p>
                <p>The socialist orientation in many LDCs has been bad for their development.
                    Government enterprises, or collective farms have been notoriously inefficient.
                    This tendency of many a less developed area leader to resist a market oriented
                    development strategies has further delayed development of their economies, and
                    in a number of cases led to their downfall.</p>
                <p>Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, inherited a relatively well
                    developed country with a significant number of trained Nigerian civil servants,
                    and excellent in-country training facilities. However, shortly after
                    independence the military assassinated the British trained Oxford/Cambridge
                    Nigerian leadership (the whole cabinet). Since then, military, and short lived
                    civilian governments, have not been up to the task of governing their country.
                    In spite of a vigorous, relatively well educated population, Nigeria has missed
                    many opportunities to move ahead, and seems to be embroiled in yet another
                    political turmoil (i.e. read quest for power).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You described the problems fairly succinctly, but what's
                        the solution(s)? Any ideas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BROWN: An additional comment or two on the problem and then I'll address one
                    approach to finding a solution. On the positive side, I think that donors in the
                    last 10 to 15 years have become much more sophisticated, and are much more adept
                    in combining the economic, social and political realities in the development of
                    practical development plans with benchmarks built in to enable the recipient
                    country and the donors to monitor the progress. Also, success is no longer
                    measured simply by the amount of increase in GNP, other factors such as civil
                    liberties, environmental effects, child labor, etc. have become part of the
                    equation in evaluating the success of a program. With computers, improved
                    satellite communications, it's easier to design, modify and monitor these
                    factors for agreed upon development plans.</p>
                <p>In recent years USAID has become much more skilled in using its inputs as a
                    catalyst to raise other contributions and help obtain the internal reforms
                    necessary for economic development. However, all of this has come at a time of
                    diminishing foreign aid. Also, our annual contribution arrears to vital
                    international organizations such as the UN (UNDP, FAO, UNICEF, etc.), IBRD and
                    IMF has severely limited our leverage. The last time I looked at our per capita
                    aid contribution worldwide, the US had slipped from the top 10 to 23rd in world.
                    More and more of our limited development related resources are earmarked in
                    advance to two or three countries. For example, about two thirds of our AID's
                    development budget goes to Egypt and Israel. Russia and the newly independent
                    states of what was formerly the USSR represent new high priority claims on
                    resources. The little that is left is divided up between Africa, Asia, the
                    Caribbean, Central and South America. Africa (apart from assistance to the
                    Republic of South Africa) appears to have been given the lowest priority.</p>
                <p>I understand that it is going to be a “ very, very hard sell, for the
                    Administration to convince Congress to vote larger foreign assistance for
                    developing countries, particularly at a time when our attention has been
                    distracted by peace-keeping exercises such as: Haiti, Bosnia, and Somalia, to
                    name a few. Also US public sentiment seems to be at an all time low in the
                    support of using tax-dollars for domestic welfare programs, not to mention
                    assistance for those “strangers” in foreign countries who don't have a vote.</p>
                <p>I don't have any magic wand to wave and solve this vital and growing critical gap
                    between the developed and developing world, especially on the African continent.
                    As we celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Marshall and contemplate its Legacy,
                    we can perhaps hope and pray that:</p>
                <p>“Just as the US (Executive Branch, Congress and the average citizen), after World
                    War II (1947), committed an important share of its GNP to help Europe get back
                    on its feet; perhaps we can persuade the “have” nations (US, Canada, Europe,
                    Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, etc.) to make an multi-national, all
                    out effort to assist the “have not” nations. While any such long term program
                    would require the support of the people of the developed countries, given the
                    right leadership this could be done. Together, the developed countries certainly
                    have the human, financial and material resources to solve this problem, if they
                    are so minded.”</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Impossible! No. Will it be easy? No. However, as the world gets smaller and
                    smaller and smaller, and international trade, and environmental considerations
                    in the LDCs become paramount to our own well-being as well as to the other
                    developed countries, it should be possible to make a “self-interest” argument.
                    For example, one could point out that in helping the third world become good
                    trading partners such as Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the benefits from increased
                    trade far outweigh the costs of the economic and humanitarian assistance. In
                    addition, China, Indonesia, India, and Vietnam, are waiting in the wings,
                    waiting to play their roles as major players on the international export
                    scene.</p>
                <p>We will have to become more creative, flexible and knowledgeable as we work out
                    our strategies to help the third world. While this may sound like heresy, it may
                    be that “benevolent dictators” devoted to free market economies will be more
                    effective in some cases, than insisting on full fledged democracies before
                    economic development takes place — look at Singapore and its single party, or
                    Hong Kong under British tutelage. Immediate adoption of “free market economies”,
                    with minimal but progressive steps towards full civil liberties” may be a better
                    formula in some cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q And who is to do all of this “educating”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BROWN: It should be a bipartisan effort which includes a strong input from our
                    academic community, especially those colleges and universities which
                    participated over the last 35 years in the world-wide development effort. AID is
                    very much in touch with these academic institutions. During the Kennedy years,
                    executive branch staffers worked closely with AID, Peace Corps, USIS, State to
                    establish and move the administration's outreach programs abroad. Congress went
                    along with these initiatives. However, in the '90s Congressional staffers and
                    subcommittees would have to be involved at an early stage.</p>
                <p>One way to get started would be for the Secretary of State, on the proposal of
                    the AID Administrator, would ask the President to initiate a “prestigious task
                    force” (with adequate support staff) to draft a joint bipartisan proposal
                    involving the executive branch, congressional staff, congressmen and women,
                    known leaders form the academic and business communities, etc.). They would be
                    given a year to produce a program and budget (both domestic and international in
                    character) to begin implementation in the 21st century.There might be a need for
                    a subcommittee for Africa. Informal contact would, of course, be maintained with
                    other potential donors, to assure that Committee recommendations were realistic
                    in an international context as well as in the US domestic scene.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>My “best of all worlds timing” for the above approach is urgent. The US and its
                    partners should be ready to move ahead and start implementation of a
                    reinvigorated aid program to help the developing world by the end of the
                    twentieth century. Implementing such a timetable would be difficult to say the
                    least. However, it is well worth it from the US and developed countries points
                    of view: As mentioned earlier, this action is needed not only from a
                    humanitarian standpoint, but also from an economic, political and social points
                    of view.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we close, I would like to conclude with a question

                <p>BROWN: We asked our three children at a family reunion several years ago, if we
                    could do it over again, would they have preferred being raised in the US and
                    having attended school here. The two boys (Chris and Greg) graduated from Kabul
                    International School, and Valerie finished seventh grade at the French school in
                    Abidjan. They were unanimous in saying they enjoyed their upbringing abroad,
                    their friends in the international community and had wonderful memories of those
                    formative years. Two of our three children live and work abroad today.</p>
                <p>Our oldest son and his wife joined AID as management interns when they completed
                    their advanced degrees at Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. They are now
                    assigned to the USAID in Haiti.Our second son is married and works in Singapore
                    as a senior buyer for Darden Restaurants (Olive Garden and Red Lobster
                    Restaurants). He travels all over South East Asia. Our daughter works in San
                    Francisco for Levi Strauss, but would love an overseas assignment. All three
                    read, write and speak French fluently. The two boys speak Farsi (Persian), and a
                    fair amount of Urdu. Our son in Haiti has picked up Creole, and our son in
                    Singapore is learning Mandarin.</p>
                <p>Fran�oise, my wife and co-worker for all those years abroad, says she has
                    wonderful memories from our different assignments in Africa, Asia and the
                    subcontinent. We still have many friends from AID and State as well as from the
                    countries in which we served. Yes, we would be willing to do it over again.</p>
                <p>Having said this we have enjoyed living in the US for the last 20 years — in New
                    England, the Washington, DC area and now California. We both agreed there is no
                    place like the U.S., our home.</p>
