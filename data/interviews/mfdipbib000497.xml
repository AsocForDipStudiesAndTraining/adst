                <p>ERLAND HEGINBOTHAM</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: October 3, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 2001 ADST</p>
                <p>[Note: This interview has not been edited by Mr. Heginbotham.]</p>
                <p>Q: To begin this, could you tell me a bit about when and where you were born and
                    about your family?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. My father was likewise born in
                    Salt Lake. My mother was from Colorado. He is a metalurigical engineer. I am not
                    certain that he ever completed college. But he was certainly very well
                    self-educated as an engineer. My grandfather was a county auditor for the county
                    of Salt Lake City by invitation of an early governor of Utah from where he had
                    been living with my grandmother. So we had fairly deep roots in Salt Lake but
                    non-Mormon. So we were part of the small minority of non-Mormons who then became
                    the majority during World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were born when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: In 1931.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had schooling before the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being a non-Mormon or a “gentile”—I guess was the
                        term.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Exactly. I was going to use that same word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little bit about being a non-Mormon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. I guess I came out something of a highbrid. We were
                    Presbyterians . We had to go all the way across town to church. I lived in a
                    predominantly Mormon community. My closest friends were fascinating Mormon kids.
                    So I became fairly active in the local ward on sort of a non-religious basis. I
                    found everything about the Mormon lifestyle attractive—their focus on the
                    family, their morality, their concern about physical well being; their social
                    welfare system— supporting people who were unfortunate or underprivileged in
                    some way. I found it very difficult to find any reason for wanting to accept the
                    theology. So I found it quite irrational for me. I was always sort of a distant
                    observer but I picked up certain habits. One was a very strong family devotion.
                    And the second was that I neither drank or smoked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are drinking Coca Cola which has caffeine in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Quite shocking! That is my one and only occasional vice in that
                    category. that I cultivate. So I was very interested in the church and its
                    conservative politics although I didn't realize it until I went to Stanford.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am not too familiar with the Mormons. If you don't join
                        thMormon church are you then damned to hell or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: You are just not saved. I am not quite sure exactly what happens to
                    you. One of the more intriguing and difficult bits of theology is that the true
                    word was taken from the earth and that no one that lived in the period not too
                    long after Christ saved unless member when the word was restored with the golden
                    tablets</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The 1820's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: 1830's. This restored the true word. So you had to go back and
                    baptize for your relatives as far back as you could trace them. Thus the sort of
                    intense interest in genealogy and the outstanding records they have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at an age when you might be dating. Was this a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Not at all. I had a very close and dear female frienwhom I dated and
                    with whom I have retained close relations.</p>
                <p>Q: Although you were about as far away from as one could almost get, did you have
                    any feel for World War II ? It is often is one of the major experiences of
                    people of our generation who then ended up dealing with foreign affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. Absolutely. I followed World War II from 1939 when I would have
                    been eight. When Hitler moved into Poland, that was one of the first specific
                    political memories I have. We followed that on the radio. We followed that in
                    the papers. It was a very engaging aspect of life. Furthermore, of course, we
                    became subject to the usual rationing coupons and to all the restrictions that
                    came along with it. So the war effected us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much in the way of international affairs in
                        higschool?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: One of the first confessions that I am going to have to make to you
                    is that I have an appalling memory for a number of personal experiences. My
                    memory tends to be much more selective than I would like it to be. We had an
                    international relations club in high school. I would have gone to Stanford at 15
                    had I gone through the system. Instead, I took an extra year in high school. I
                    wanted to be a research scientist. And the extra year in high school allowed me
                    to take debating and a number of classes that I hadn't been able to take in my
                    previous routine course work. I got involved in the debate class which really
                    changed my life in many ways because subject that year was” Resolved that there
                    should be a world federal government.” An absolutely ridiculous and absurd
                    notion at the time. It just screamed in the face of reality. So my debate
                    partner and I simply refused to debate the affirmative and developed a counter
                    case revolving around economically congenial regions which we called “Ecodes” -
                    a sort of confederations with common interest which then affiliated in a very
                    collegiate kind of structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of different free trade zones?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We didn't premise it on trade. We premised it on economic interests
                    abroad and considered that those were dominant factors and features in
                    international relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was really a very sophisticated approach. What
                        brought thaabout?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I really don't know. I guess I was very intrigued by had the strong
                    sense that economics were to be a factor in international conflicts. It just
                    seemed to me to make a lot of sense. We developed a very elaborate case. I would
                    have to go back to my papers to see how elaborate a sort of logic structure we
                    had in mind. It was fun for me because later I saw and worked with an evolution
                    of regional economic groupings. So it was kind of interesting. Furthermore, I
                    became attracted to the outside world through National Geographic.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I might just add an amusing personal footnote. Among the people in the debate
                    class was a guy who used to puff out his cheeks; he didn't have a great style,
                    but was a very, very bright debater. We had a lot of fun teasing Steve who was
                    one of the brighter guys. His full name is Steven Cubby of the “Seven Habit of
                    Effective People.” He is now President of Brigham Young UniversitSo the debating
                    team was an interesting little cross- section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: So I spent the last high school year reading and debating and as a
                    result of the debate class I became interested in the war.</p>
                <p>Q: The Mormon Church put great emphasis on missionaries. Of course, for most of
                    this time the world was at war, so that it would have been hard to the place
                    missionaries.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I did attend, in high school, a kind of Sunday evening youth group
                    which was Mormon. The leader was a very charismatic and very impressive and very
                    rational, intellectual type who brought some of that missionary zeal iBut not
                    whole lot. At that time the Mormons were focused on Northern Europe although we
                    had a next door neighbor who had been in Australia and worked among the
                    Aborigines, but that tended to be rare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attracted you towards Stanford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: An accident. My family was not at all well situated financially and
                    I knew that if I wanted to go anywhere other than the University of Utah, it
                    would have to be some special. I was interested in international relations. I
                    was attracted to the notion of going to a better university Then came along the
                    opportunity the Navy program in which you volunteered for the Navy in exchange
                    for four year of paid college In that process I was forced to choose a college.
                    I had very little worldly sophistication at that point and Stanford was far
                    away. So I chose Stanford as my first choice. As it happened, I got measles and
                    my eyesight deteriorated just about the time I was scheduled for the medical
                    exam; I had passed the written and oral exams. So I didn't get into the Navy and
                    didn't get that scholarship. But at that point my family decided that we would
                    manage somehow. So I applied for scholarships to Stanford and worked a great
                    deal while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Stanford from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: From 1949-1955 with intermittent periods abroad. went into the Class
                    of 1949 and came out in the Class of 1955.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Q: At Stanford, we are talking now about the post-War period. We were moving into
                    the Cold War. In the first place, what type of courses were you taking and what
                    was being taught ?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The first year at Stanford was pretty rigorous in terms of
                    requirements. There weren't t a lot of options at that point. In any event, as a
                    result of my debate class, I was very fascinated in all the world and that I was
                    going to major in International Relations. I started out with a World
                    Civilization course at Stanford which was a heavy course. The course was taught
                    by a pretty liberal professor who took some considerable pleasure in my
                    conservative viewpoint on Utah history. It was an incredible course although
                    ethnocentric as all courses were at that point. I joined the International
                    Relations club and that stimulated my interests. It included a number of
                    politically oriented folks.</p>
                <p>The course work was. a pretty sad nature, frankly. It consisted of the basic
                    courses in political science, economics, geography, history; those were my main
                    focus. I also took both French and Russian language courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you went overseas, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. My parents, my Dad in particular, was very unhappy with the
                    notion that any one who might to working for the federal government might also
                    be interested in going overseas. For some reason he had this thing although when
                    I was in my senior year, my father worked for the federal government working
                    overseas. So despite any anxieties, he and my mother and brother went out to the
                    South Pacific. Actually he went out initially for a private mining venture in
                    New Caledonia. Since I was getting pretty straight A-pluses and A-minuses, he
                    gave as my graduation present a trip around the world, so that I could visit
                    them in New Caledonia. It turned out that my brother was getting zero schooling
                    in New Caledonia so he and I went to France where we succeeded in getting him
                    into a private school. And I succeeded in getting into “Institute de Politique”
                    in Paris. We had a fabulous year traveling around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be 1953.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: That was 1952-53.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a lot of debate about Vietnam at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: No. At that time there was a lot going on in Algeria as well as
                    problems in former French colonies. I took a good deal of economic geography
                    which related to some of the French interests abroad. But the main preoccupation
                    of the year was the Rosenberg case.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Could you explain what the Rosenberg case
                        was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were accused of spying for the Soviet
                    Union. They had been convicted of espionage and I think then there was a
                    question of pardon. The French were infuriated by the whole affairs which they
                    saw as being conducted with a “McCarthy mentality”. So I learned a great deal
                    more than I ever wanted to or ever planned to about the American judicial and
                    political systems. This was a case which led me to learn more about my own
                    country than I learned about France. I began to see comparisons and differences
                    in many, many ways that I hadn't been aware of before.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Rosenbergs were executed. The fact that they were
                        botJewish raised all sorts of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Terrible ramifications</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was, as you say, the height of the McCarthy
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The case had a profound effect. But I also discovered that not very
                    many French had traveled by the early 1950s. They were still in a recovering
                    economy. I went as far out of my way as possible to avoid Americans because I
                    wanted to immerse myself in the French language and culture. But I found it very
                    difficult to get to know French people. By far and away, my closest friends were
                    all Germans where we had no common language; we exchanged linguistic discoveries
                    and that was kind of an odd experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Paris, then you came back to Stanford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I came back for my senior year. The McCarthy influence was profound
                    to me. I dropped my international relations major because it seemed to me to
                    have little relevance for my future. I decided that if I were to get into the
                    Foreign Service, I should be in a position that would make me so employable that
                    I could in protest to any untoward pressures of any sort, and yet could at the
                    same time be able to rebound and support a family.</p>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Absolutely. Unethical behavior and the influence that McCarthy was
                    perpetrating on the government. The China “group” had been devastated.I had to
                    go into the Foreign Service with a willingness to turn around and walk out the
                    door at any time. Which was not unlike a Foreign Service career today which
                    lasts for a few years and then is subject to review by the officer to see
                    whether he or she wants to continue for a lifetime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:. So you graduated in 1954. And then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I took the Foreign Service exam. In my senior year, I switched my
                    major to economics. Since I only had had two economics courses before then, I
                    had a lot of scrambling to do. I became very keenly interested in economics. I
                    did sufficiently well that I was actually hired as a teaching assistant for the
                    third quarter of my senior year - a job that is normally offered to graduate
                    students with a lot more experience than I had had. I enjoyed that. I worked at
                    the Stanford Research Institute. I decided that I would take the Foreign Service
                    exam, but stay at Stanford. I started in on a graduate degree. I was going for a
                    straight Ph.D. in economics in order to save time and money. But then I was
                    accepted into the Foreign Service. I was also depressed by the mathemiticfation
                    and quantification of economics; it had lost all touch with reality as I saw it.
                    So at that point I decided that I would bail out of academia and into real
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about when you took the Foreign Service
                        exam. You took it in 1953 or 1954?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: 1953 I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you took the three and a half day exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:. Then you took the oral exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. That was very interesting because the Department of State had
                    stopped hiring for a couple of years. But by 1953. they were starting again and
                    were just begun to hire. The Department had just set up traveling panels for the
                    first time. But I was a kid in a hurry. I was very poor. I was literally working
                    my way through Stanford. I had three jobs and I decided that I was going to take
                    my own money and buy a ticket to Washington and not sit around waiting and
                    wondering for the panels. I was going to get as far up in the queue as I could.
                    I don't know why I was in such a hurry. But at the time, it seemed the right
                    thing to do. It was and I fortunately passed.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oral exam. Can you remember any questions and how it
                        waconstituted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: May I back up just a bit? The history to the Foreign Service was
                    very interesting. Prior to the early 1950s, there was a very strong Ivy League
                    bias in the employment practices of the Foreign Service. While Stanford was
                    considered in the same academic standard as the Ivy Leagues, it did not have the
                    right aura. But in the early 1950s, the Department began to emphasize
                    geographical diversity in its employment practices.</p>
                <p>The prevailing view of the oral exam - whether myth or truth I don't know, was
                    that the panel would go out of its way to find all kinds of ways of tripping you
                    up. I didn't find it so. It seemed a pretty straight forward panel. I really
                    remember almost nothing of the exam, except two questions which showed that they
                    were looking for how much you learned from where I had been. They asked me
                    specifically about New Caledonia and what kind of things it did and why it was
                    important, and probed into the mineralization and exploitation - one thing and
                    another. There was labor representative on the panel who wanted to find out if I
                    was aware of or knew about a particular French laborer - quite obscure French
                    laborer. I did happen to know about him and was able to give a fairly extensive
                    comment. I guess those were the subjects that stood out as being out of the
                    ordinary. The others I think are obscure to me now, because they were pretty
                    much in line with what one might expect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were part of a massive infusion of “main street”
                        into thForeign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. I have to say that I probably represented the non-Ivy League
                    group. Whether there was any bias in the selection process or no, I cannot say,
                    but it would be foolish for me to deny that I was part of that “new look”
                    because I was certainly not Ivy League. I was never East before I came to
                    Washington for the oral exam. That was interesting.</p>
                <p>I had one other problem. Some people at Stanford they were furious at me for
                    having passed the Foreign Service exam. Never had anybody gotten in who hadn't
                    been either history or science major. I knew then that I would be a
                    minority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come in to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I came in of September 22, 1955. There was a brief hiatus during
                    which many came in members of the civil service and then were transferred to the
                    Foreign Service after a period of a weekI finished at Stanford. By happenstance
                    I didn't have to pay my way back to the East Coast because I was in the Army
                    Reserves and my summer duty was at the Pentagon. My introduction to the
                    Washington bureaucracy was actually during my six weeks summer training at the
                    Pentagon which was interesting.</p>
                <p>Q: So you took what is now known as the A-100 course, a basic officers course.
                    You must have been in class three, two or something like that. I was class one
                    and I started in July of 1955.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I suppose; I don't remember the number. I might just an odd
                    footnote. Ours is the only entrance class in the Foreign Service which has had
                    an annual reunion every single year without fail with all members present.</p>
                <p>Q: Could you talk a bit about the members, the composition, and if you have any
                    thoughts about maybe the outlook of the class from which the people came?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We had an extremely diverse class. There was a Brooklyn school
                    teacher who had never been out of Brooklyn, who later became an ambassador.
                    There was a pretty good geographic mix - people from pretty much all over. A
                    number of people were veterans. I was by a good margin the youngest in the
                    class. Most of the class were people who had been waiting to take the exam
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>The average class age I think was 30 or possibly over. I was 22; so there was a
                    big age spread. Those who were older who were up in their mid-'30s. By logic it
                    was a very mature class of people with working experience, who had made
                    sacrifices or made a long- term commitment to come into the Foreign Service. I
                    think there was a high degree of commitment. I don't remember that there was any
                    particular political leanings. There was one student who was a lot of fun who
                    had been very active in the University of Chicago politics and that generated a
                    lot of discussion about politics. As I look at our reunions I don't see that
                    there's much change in that. We were a diverse political group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the training? I assume Yen Attleman and Joe

                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes, they were indeed exactly the two. I think it was good. It did
                    what it needed to do. I quickly decided that I didn't never want to do counselor
                    work. But, it introduced me to all the things that were going on. The course was
                    better for some than for others. I was among the less fortunate who were
                    assignment to the department as a result of Wristonization which prevented me
                    from having the kind of rotational assignments that my colleagues who went
                    overseas did. There were some opportunities in the course that I would have
                    liked to do, but didn't get a chance. Overall, I found the A-100 course a very
                    respectable one.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Not really. I have to confess to entered or developed in the Service
                    a certain number of fairly strong negative prejudicious. Later in my career, I
                    found that I had to work in some of these areas. BuI wasn't interested in the
                    commercial function; the lectures on the subject were terribly boring. I was
                    interested in the economic function, because I was much more attracted to
                    economic analysis. It went to INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research), but I
                    didn't develop any very clear concept for my future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, your first assignment, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Well, as I have mentioned, the Wristonization process had began soon
                    after I came to work in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain what Wristonization was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Walter Wriston had recommended that the bifurcation of the Foreign
                    Service and Domestic Service (or Civil Service) was unhealthy. He and his panel
                    members thought that the people in INR and on the country desks who had never
                    served overseas lacked prospective in breath and diversity. Therefore he felt
                    that it was important to integrate these two services and bring some Foreign
                    Service people in to serve in Washington as well as to get some of the Civil
                    Service people out to the field. The department embarked for an extended period
                    to implement the Wriston recommendations to give the people who had spent their
                    whole careers in Washington opportunity to serve abroad as quickly as possible
                    which meant that the number of positions oversea available to the regular
                    Foreign Service were fewer - although the number of positions at home increased
                    for FSOs.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>I would suppose that more senior civil servants who had been Wristonized probably
                    went to the more interesting assignments overseas, leaving the regular Foreign
                    Service with a higher proportion of consular and other entry level assignments.
                    As I mentioned, I was among those whose lot fell to a be assigned to a
                    departmental position. That assignment was in INR, which I was alright with me.
                    I didn't know Washington, I didn't know much about the East Asia, so the
                    assignment was quite alright with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in INR from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was in INR from the end of 1955, basically 195through 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What part of INR were you in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was in East Asia, the East Asian Bureau and I was working with
                    “unwristonized” and “unwashed”people who were very good and fascinating. It was
                    great group to work with. A few Foreign Service people had come from East Asia.
                    I was assigned to the economics branch and had a number interesting assignments.
                    I concentrated on North Korea and on Korean fertilizer problem, which didn't
                    seem like a great glamorous way to begin a career. Also worked on improving
                    relations between the Koreans and the Japanese. Those were some of the things
                    that worked on. .</p>
                <p>Q: And of course in a way, these things are still going on. North Korea is still
                    a threat, a puzzle and a disaster all at the same time and the Koreans and
                    Japanese still haven't reached an accommodation.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Still fighting over islands.</p>
                <p>Q: Still fighting over islands. There is a sort of mutual dislike based on
                    century old problems. Could you describe a little about how people were looking
                    at East Asia. I suppose one of the major issues during this time was whether
                    China, the Tijuans Straits and all that. Even though it wasn't in your field,
                    were you picking up how they people were looking at things? We had a rather
                    hawkish administration, the Dallas Eisenhower Administration, particularly on
                    China, the height of the China lobby and all that. Were you picking up the
                    difference between the professionals and the politicians?</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: What stands out in my memory are two main thrusts. One was the pre
                    occupation with the Communist threat based on what was going on in China
                    economically and also what was going on in North Korea economically. At that
                    time, North Korea was far stronger than South Korea in economic terms and in
                    other respects as well. When the peninsula was partitioned, the North inherited
                    a lot of industrial capacity and energy leaving the South essentially an
                    agricultural society. I should say that I was very much involved with or exposed
                    to people who were working on China on the economics of the area.</p>
                <p>On the political side what I remember mostly vividly were the pre occupations
                    with Japanese politics. There was a lot more turmoil that there were labor
                    problems. There were many riots and public demonstrations in Japan at that time.
                    Possibly because the economic branches were compartmentalized, I didn't get very
                    much involved in China; so I don't really recall any great debates going on on
                    that, but there was a lot of pre- occupation about where Japan was going and how
                    —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to Japan, what was the Korean fertilizer
                        issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We were close to the end of the Korean War. The South Korean economy
                    was in total shambles. The one thing that mattered most was getting fertilizer
                    to the Koreans so that the economy could get going again. By sheer accident, the
                    first INR research study I did was on fertilizer.</p>
                <p>Q: I served in Korea during the Korean War and if there is anything that stuck in
                    one's mind came from how they fertilized the land, which was night soil, known
                    as a honey pit. There were honey wagons and the smell was appalling. They were
                    everywhere and when they weren't in a place they were being transported to a
                    place. One certainly appreciates the fact that later they got regular
                    fertilizer.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It was hard to imagine that there was a shortage ofertilizer -</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Japan? What was the feeling about the Japanese
                        economat that time? Was it going anywhere; were we concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Most of the focus on Japan had to do with the occupation policies. I
                    think a lot had to do with what was, how the demonopolization policies were
                    being implemented and whether you were, in fact, beginning to see the
                    resurrection of the ibotzu in new molds. As I recall, the Japanese had
                    substantial balance of payment problems at that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>Strangely, the politics stick out more in my mind; e.g., Kishe and the transition
                    of politics and the labor strives. The labor problems were major - whether they
                    were going to have enterprise unions or political unions or how that was going
                    to be resolved. It seemed as though the labor movement could become a very
                    disruptive and very contentious and troublesome force. There were many
                    communists in the labor movement, there were actually some communists unions and
                    of course, given our preoccupation with communism this was something that we
                    were watching very closely. Those were the things that stand out in my
                    memory.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about South Korea? Did we see any hope there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I will now have to sort of merge my observations, because at that
                    time again, I was concentrating primarily on North Korea. What I was doing and
                    spending vast amounts of time was on extrapolating percentage increases without
                    any absolute base on which to go. So, the question was, is North Korea really
                    developing industry at the rate it says and what does this really mean and what
                    are these percentages actually telling us? Are there even scraps of evidence
                    that one can build on? I was so involved in the North Korean thing that I didn't
                    spend a lot of time on South Korea which was limping along in a pretty pathetic
                    situation. The AID program was very large. The reliance on military support
                    programs and things of that sort were pretty overwhelming in 1955 when the war
                    had ended. Our contributions were mainly relief and reconstruction. One just
                    didn't see any end in sight at for economic development in South Korea.</p>
                <p>Q: What about this both from the A-100 course, INR, particularly A-100 course.
                    Did you get any feel about John Foster Dulles as the Secretary of State and how
                    he was viewed by the Foreign Service up to this point?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I'm trying to reconstruct when I developed a very strong opinion
                    about John Foster Dulles and it will be a little difficult. It will be very
                    difficult for me to pinpoint exactly. All I know is that during that period when
                    I was here in Washington, I begin to dread waking up in the morning and looking
                    at the newspaper, because of the brinkmanship that this man was about to visit
                    on some unsuspecting country or region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might explain what brinkmanship is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Brinkmanship was basically threatening people that if they didn't
                    tow the American line there would be all kinds of hell to pay. Of course, we had
                    lots of levers at that point with AID programs and military programs and
                    military forces and just all kinds of stuff going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I have to give you a little political aside. Early in Washington through purest
                    accident, I happen to meet my bride-to-be whom I didn't marry until my first
                    tour overseas ended. But, I became very active in her father's church, which
                    happened to be National Presbyterian Church, which was attended by the President
                    and by John Foster Dulles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was an elder in the church?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: He was an elder in the church; the pastor was Eisenhower's chaplain
                    in Battle of the Bulge and during much of World War II in Europe. It was a
                    church that I have come fondly to call a the seat of the military-industrial
                    complex, because it had a lot of connections with large money. Not that that
                    reflects negatively, but that was my first real exposure to the conservative
                    point of view and the mix of political and money.</p>
                <p>Q: You say you came out of a very conservative state, you came out feeling
                    conservative, you were lashed with these liberals at Stanford and all. By the
                    time you got here you had quite a conservative secretary of state and a
                    conservation administration. Did you have a different outlook or not?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. It would be somewhat hard to trace. I think I probably have a
                    more liberal bias. I used to rebel at some of the stories my Dad told and some
                    of his attitudes that I thought were just too sort of pro-private enterprise and
                    pro-business companies. Even in Utah I developed some instincts in that
                    direction. Then of course, in California a numbers of my friends were on the
                    liberal side.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon was the vice president at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes, after the infamous Nixon debates with Helen GahageDouglas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he ran for Senate against her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Right. I had friends who felt very, very strongly about these
                    things. I was still pretty a political naive by the time I got back to
                    Washington. Then I began to, within the church, to become a sort of a young
                    Turk. I gave increasing attention to the youth program and the young people and
                    other social undertakings. I guess at that point I begin to become “ politically
                    involved” in what I guess you would have to describe a more liberal than
                    conservative orientation.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: That was an interesting story; it was my first learning on how to
                    work the bureaucracy. I had enjoyed INR; I had learned a good deal and it was
                    probably the beginning of the salvation of my writing skills, because I got a
                    lot of heavy critique for my writing - which were well deserved and which proved
                    to be invaluablI took a course in writing. The exposure to and learning about
                    Washington was all great stuff, but by the time two years had gone by I was
                    wearing out. It was still very tough getting an acceptable assignment; so I
                    started shopping around. I knew I wasn't going to get anything worthwhile from
                    the State Department and so I started shopping around in AID (Agency for
                    International Development). Low and behold, I found that there was a really
                    great job opening up in the AID mission in Korea. I volunteered for the job and
                    AID requested my assignment to Korea and that's how I escaped from
                    Wristonization in Washington.</p>
                <p>I went to Korea which was a bit of a trauma, because I was engaged at that point
                    in time, but my wife who is six years younger was still finishing her degree and
                    we didn't want to take her out of college, but anyway that was worked out. So I
                    went to Korea.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked there from 1958 till what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was there from 1958 until 1960. I don't remember the months, but I
                    suspect it was probably mid year. I had a fabulous job. While most of my
                    colleagues were going to non-substantive, non-challenging, uninteresting work, I
                    was assigned to the non-project branch of the AID mission. The AID program at
                    that time was probably in the six or seven hundred million dollar range and of
                    that about two hundred and fifty million dollars was granted to Korea as
                    non-project AID - unspecified allocations foKorean and American agencies to use
                    for bidding by Koreans for the purchase of essential commodities. Those
                    commodities were paid for the foreign exchange rights; when they were sold in
                    the local market, the proceeds in local currency in a loan or grant funds. These
                    funds were called “counterpart funds” and were used to pay the local currency
                    costs of projects which also had some dollar contributions. The non-project
                    program generated both resources to get the economy going again and put a lid on
                    inflationary pressures by taking local currency out of the local market. We
                    could control the flow of these counterparts funds into the economy, thereby
                    expanding it while keeping inflation under control.The AID mission had probably
                    had four or five hundred people in the project implementation phase. Our office
                    managed a little two hundred and fifty million dollar program staffed, I think,
                    by two Americans and six or eight local Korean staff. It was a very, very,
                    fascinating job. Absolutely, unbelievable. The Koreans have been referred to,
                    among other things, as the Irish of the Orient. They are very tough; they are
                    very stubborn, so it made for a very challenging environment in which to
                    negotiate. The amounts of U.S. non-project AID were allocated into quarterly
                    traunches and for each quarter we would negotiated with the Korean government on
                    the composition of the commodities to be brought in for the economy. The Koreans
                    being very, very stubborn had adamantly refused to create a realistic exchange
                    rate. They were determined to keep it as low as possible, so that imports came
                    in very inexpensively; they didn't worry about exports because there weren't
                    any. The American government was not about to be provided very small amounts of
                    won for their dollar input. As a result, it was agreed that the bidders would
                    bid for the foreign exchange for the dollars and there would be “competitive”
                    bidding for these commodities.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The first thing I observed was that in effect, we had a foreign exchange auction
                    system. Very rare experience in world history. My eyes lit up and I found the
                    process fascinating. I discovered that strangely enough a lot of commodities
                    went at the minimum or official exchange rate. There were others that didn't.
                    The foreign exchange allocations were literally, as I said, by commodity. I
                    begin educating myself on why these differences and it became quite clear that
                    the Korean government was following Japanese management practices and was seeing
                    to it that there was no competition in the sensitive commodities; but the less
                    important imports were up for grabs. So, you had this extremely wide
                    discrepancy. I would probably be far off on the numbers, but let's say that the
                    base rate was 181 won per dollar, but there were imports worth six and seven
                    hundred won per dollar - 701 won per dollar for a certain more popular
                    commodities such as plastics; plastics, raw materials, etc. The largest amount
                    of funding we supplied was for fertilizer. So, I was right back in my own old
                    business again.It appeared that capital formation in Korea in the period before
                    I got there - after the war - had fallen in to the hands of those who were able
                    to make large amounts of money relatively easily. “I-E” as they are known in the
                    United States - the madams and the women who controlled the kisang houses and
                    other houses that were frequented by the GIs - had accumulated large amounts of
                    money. In Korea, it was customary that the women controlled the household
                    budget; they were also beginning to control the national budget. As a result, it
                    was the madams who had the money to buy the fertilizer and had the monopoly on
                    fertilizer acquisition and distribution. So it was usually the case that those
                    who held the monopolies were not often the owners; the madams and others simply
                    held the chits and they could then resell these chits for very large amounts.
                    They were getting the fertilizer chits, let's say for 181 won and then reselling
                    them probably for four or five times this amount, because fertilizer was just
                    very, very scare.</p>
                <p>There were other interesting areas which became very political. For example,
                    there was news print. In a very closed society where newspapers were not very
                    aggressive or active, that wouldn't have seemed like a very interesting
                    commodity. But, it happened that all the school books were printed on news
                    prints at that time. It also happened, as one came to discover, that Madam Rhee
                    was very involved in the school print monopoly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Syngman Rhee being the President.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Syngman Rhee being the President. His wife, Madam Rhee was of
                    Austrian origin and I can't remember how and when they married. Anyway, she wore
                    Korean clothes and was very, very integrated in Korea in more ways than one can
                    tell.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I figured that Korea was going nowhere fast as long as it didn't begin to
                    consolidate these exchange rates. I took it as my task over the two years there
                    to go as far as I could toward achieving a unitary rate of exchange for the
                    Korean won - not as my communist friends wanted to do by negotiating an
                    agreement with the Korean government, but by simply bringing about reality
                    through the auction markets. I begin to experiment with very much tougher
                    negotiations, for example, on quantities, and I began also to get approval for
                    grouping closely related groups of commodities where there was insufficient
                    bidding. In other words, I would take, say plastics, raw materials and other
                    industrial chemicals and there might have been a significant discrepancy between
                    the grades. I would combine them and make them undifferentiated. We couldn't
                    specify. The Koreans got the dollars and it was up to them what they did with
                    them. During this process I learned a great deal about Korean economy, but I
                    learned even more about Korean politics; I started getting late night telephone
                    calls; I started getting threats; I started getting visitors who were clearly
                    connected with Madam Rhee who literally issues fairly dire threats on my
                    existence if I persisted in this sort of thing. It was fun nevertheless because
                    I could tell immediately when I was getting into territory that was going to be
                    interesting and that of course, increased my determination.</p>
                <p>Q: Some Koreans are, very tough looking people. Can you tell both how the threats
                    were made and whether you got any support from our AID mission?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: This is an extremely interesting and painful question. I was able to
                    do some relatively minor things without attracting very much attention. But on
                    several occasions, the negotiations which I carried on with a Korean counterpart
                    lasted a couple of days. They were very vigorous. My counterpart was an
                    economist and so we really enjoyed the substance of what we were dealing with
                    and we debated very substantive questions. I would take the agreed package back
                    and I could absolutely count on it that the ministry of reconstruction would
                    come to see Joe Brent, who was our mission director, and that somehow the
                    Koreans wound up virtually with their original position despite the negotiations
                    that had taken place. Joe Brent would listen to the Koreans every time. He
                    believed in them; he thought they were great. No matter how strong a case we
                    had, he simply discounted it and dismissed out-of-hand the arguments of staff on
                    these issues. He was apparently determined to be revered by the Koreans and so
                    it was an extremely painful and unhappy situation. But, it didn't at all deter
                    me and I was able to get Washington approval for consolidating some of
                    commodities. In some cases, in order to get consolidation I had to go across
                    major categories, and to do that I had to get approval from Washington. There
                    were cases when I was successful in doing that. Joe Brent didn't last forever,
                    so we had Loyal Giner later come in and he was a much more reasonable and less
                    malleable mission director.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find that in the AID bureaucracy one could make one's discontent known
                    back in Washington through visitors, mail or what have you?</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: You know, you'll have to forgive me. This goes back a ways and I
                    don't remember. I started out as an assistant in the non-project branch. I
                    became the chief of the non-project branch. I had a very supportive boss, Tom
                    Niblock, and my recollection is that Tom was very supportive, especially with
                    Loyal Giner. I think that by the time I had gained enough credibility and enough
                    support from Tom that when we had a change of mission directors, I was able to
                    get more done within the mission so that it didn't become a problem.</p>
                <p>There was major issue that I would like to relate. This happened at a time when
                    the program was down around 230 million dollars. We shaved the all programs
                    slightly. It was quite clear to me that the non-project program was a positive
                    impediment now to the change that was necessary for Korea to become competitive
                    both as an importer and as an exporter. I had succeeded in moving quite a good
                    distance toward a unitary exchange rate. I think by the time I left we were
                    close to three or at most four rates instead of about 20 or 25 that we had when
                    I first began. So, we'd moved quite a distance and there was almost nothing
                    selling at 181 won per dollar anymore. That's a notional figure. I went to
                    Washington with the proposition that we should begin an evolutionary process of
                    reducing the AID program I felt that in order to get the Koreans' attention we
                    needed to reduce non-project assistance by a minimum of 20 million dollars. It
                    wasn't needed; the Koreans were beginning to generate their own savings; the
                    madams were doing nicely, thank you from all those illicit rates which were
                    bringing in fat profits. There was plenty of money around. I didn't think that
                    money, local currency, was not really an issues. The issue was the profitability
                    of enterprises which were being challenged by large imports of American goods at
                    still below market rates of foreign exchange. My argument was that rather than
                    going through the excruciating political pain of making the last consolidations
                    on the exchange rate, which they would have been fought very, very bitterly by
                    the Koreans, that it was better simply to get the message across that the trough
                    was drying out. We are cutting this program and that this is the first crunch
                    you can count on its progressive elimination.</p>
                <p>Washington at that time would not hear of it. It was only after I left that they
                    hired Jim Killen as mission director. He came in and started cutting the
                    non-project program and created what I had recommended. I hope that I was
                    instrumental in helping soften Washington up to the notion that this was the
                    essential way to go. But, Killen certainly had his own instincts and he was
                    aptly named. He was the opposite of Joe Brent. He came in determined to change
                    the assistance program, but he was after my tine so I didn't have the pleasure
                    of doing that myself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there you say the issue was money. Bribery
                        has beethe mother's milk of Korean enterprise right from the start.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Let's be broad: Asian enterprise.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Q: Asian enterprise. I ran the counselor section at one time in Korea and
                    corruption was a major problem and continues to be a major problem. You were
                    dealing with the same sort of thing, something people wanted. During the time
                    you were there how about corruption?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It was such a fascination to me that I determined that if I should
                    leave the Foreign Service soon after my Korean tour I would spend my next two or
                    three years writing a book - an analysis on the economics of corruption. The
                    question was to what extent is corruption economically functional and to what
                    extent is it economically dysfunctional? I thought I could see at the end of my
                    tour that there the beginnings of a transition. First of all, many of the
                    madams, as well as many men, begin to understand what was going on. They found
                    other non-monopolized enterprises outside of fertilizer which were beginning to
                    be very rewarding. The Koreans were hell bent to industrialize and so a lot of
                    industrialization was going on. The presence of the military greatly facilitated
                    that, because instead of having to export the products initially, a lot of the
                    production was expendables for the U.S. military. They got used to producing to
                    world standards by producing expendables for the GIs in Korea, which was great.
                    What was beginning to happen was the corrupt officials in the government who
                    were the key to issuing permits - endless permits and all kinds of discretionary
                    opportunities including the non-project import program - began to see that more
                    money could be made by going into enterprises than by staying in government.</p>
                <p>I was beginning to see the very early stages of the transition where people were
                    beginning to leave government before their retirement time to establish an
                    existing relationship with the private sector. Incidentally, where corruption
                    was most painful was at the school level. It got vicious in the area of school
                    books and the school uniforms where the grafters would take their cuts, at the
                    expense, of the lowest levels of society. That upset me no end. The big boys
                    could defend for themselves. It started to affect the poor people and that was
                    really rough. I was faced with a dilemma because on the one hand, I wanted to
                    raise the price of textbooks and the news print prices up, but on the other
                    hand, I didn't want to deny a good education to the many poor children. I must
                    say that my efforts on prices had very little affect on the cost of school books
                    because all the changes in the dollar exchange rate was going into hands of the
                    profiteers and that was not affecting the price of books at all.I was involved
                    with a young Presbyterian group and there was a very charismatic Presbyterian
                    minister who appealed greatly to the young. He was determined to create a legal
                    system and a legal structure for Korea that would limit the opportunities for
                    discretionary action. I can say that through that approach and through the
                    non-project program, I saw just about every aspect of corruption. There should
                    have been more of a rule of law than a rule of men as the minister had wanted.
                    On the other hand, the corruption I saw was in part responsible for the vast
                    amounts of capital formation in Korea. Some of that capital went in to
                    speculation and made many people quite rich so that they were able to afford
                    mistresses, live the high life and leave their wives at home to take care of the
                    kids. But, others began enterprises that socially redeeming and really began to
                    form a base which ultimately led to Korean industrialization.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is the 13th of November, 1996. You are in Korea. I wanted to ask whether
                    there was ever have any pressure put on you by Koreans or others? Were there
                    bribes offered and that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I never had any bribes offered me directly. I had pressure put on
                    me; I had frequent telephone calls, very agitated telephone calls from
                    government officials; I had late night telephone calls from people asserting
                    that school children were going to go without books and all kinds of dire
                    consequences would happen if I didn't relent on some of my views. I was
                    protected by two extremely upright and fine Korean employees and I never thought
                    to ask them whether they were getting pressured, but I think I would have heard
                    if they were. Although, again one never knows.</p>
                <p>The other thing was that I was also protected by the wishy-washy behavior of the
                    AID mission director who, as I mentioned previously, after I concluded
                    negotiations, heard several complaints from the minister of reconstruction
                    concerning the unreasonable positions I was taking on these various issues. He
                    would always give in without any reference back to me. Had this not been my
                    first tour, think I would have stood up more aggressively against this kind of
                    behavior. In the final analysis, the Koreans suffered relatively little. The
                    unfortunate part is that they would have benefitted from what I was trying to
                    do, which was to unify the exchange rate gradually. The fact that the mission
                    director caved in, I think may also have reduced the pressure on met. Although,
                    I never thought about it until this minute.</p>
                <p>Q: What about, what was your feeling about the rest of the embassy? You've talked
                    about the AID mission. What was your feeling about the caliber in the embassy
                    and how it was operating and all that?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Oh, well, I had a couple of friends who were just absolutely
                    outstanding like Tom Schutz, who was just terrific. He was extraordinary. He was
                    kind enough to include me on various social events. He was in the political
                    section so there was no reason particularly for us to work together, but he
                    included me in a lot of things that he didn't need to and I remain in his debt
                    for that.</p>
                <p>Besides that, my contacts with the embassy were not that frequent. First of all,
                    I had a very heavy work load and secondly, I felt that I was learning more about
                    the politics and the economics of Korea than the embassy was. I was quite
                    content to go about doing my thing, because I knew the inner workings of Korea
                    lot better than they did, primarily due tp the kinds of reaction feedback I
                    would get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, was there any sort of connect between you and
                        theconomic section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Not that I recall. My principle interactions were with the rest of
                    the AID mission, because we were importing not only basic commodities that were
                    intermediary goods for production processes, but we also imported a lot of
                    equipment and spare parts and other things that were directly relevant to a lot
                    of the AID projects that were being undertaken in the country. I really just
                    didn't have a lot of time and we were sort of at the opposite ends of town from
                    the embassy, so I really didn't do a lot with the embassy at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think last, what was your impression so overall and
                        maybe yowere getting from your colleagues about the Syngman Rhee
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I found it very disturbing. This was my first overseas tour so I
                    didn't have any benchmark. But, as I mentioned, I was active with a young church
                    group in which was led by a Korean pastor whom I felt, was just an extraordinary
                    person. From that young church group I got a lot of inside views as to how
                    things were working and weren't working and kinds of corruptions that were going
                    on. We began some projects that had to do with rule of law and were also
                    supporting some indigenous activities, such as the building of a Korean legal
                    center. As I recall, that effort got integrated to a degree into my non-project
                    program. So, I was very aware of a lot of the problems even though I didn't have
                    CIA contacts or anything like that. I didn't know a lot of the darker side, I am
                    sure, but it was an extremely distressing situation. The corruption that was
                    pretty rampart the government at that time and Madam Syngman Rhee participated
                    fully. I was not happy in the way that student activities were being cracked
                    down on. I was not all that surprised when the coup that overthrew Syngman Rhee
                    broke out. I was still in Seoul and that was a very fascinating event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about your experiences during the
                        coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Often I got more experience than I bargained for, because on the day
                    of the coup we were expecting someone back from a trip to the states and I
                    volunteered to go to the airport to transport him back in. On my way to the
                    airport, I was caught right in the middle of the streets filled with people
                    running wild in cars and yelling from military vehicles that they had
                    commandeered with the flags flying. This was pretty much after most of the
                    over-throw had taken place. But, it was a tremendous and emotional moment</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your Korean people working with you respond when
                        this wahappening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I just don't really have any recollection. My basirecollection is
                    that everybody was very pleased.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Q: Do you recall how you and the people around you felt about the coup that
                    overthreRhee and, what did you think about whoever would replace him. Would the
                    new leadership hurt our the programs or did you feel it couldn't help but be
                    better?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I think it was the latter, because in the ministry of reconstruction
                    we worked with some very fine people and there was some qualified highly trained
                    people, many of whom had done studies in the United States. I had no problems or
                    quibbles with them. I mentioned that the principle negotiator on the Korean side
                    was a very, very close personal friend. I just had no doubts that if these
                    people were freed from some of the perversions that took place under Rhee that
                    things would be better. It was pretty inevitable that a military government
                    would succeed the Rhee regime however, given the circumstances and the fact that
                    the country might not been ready for a democratically elected government. There
                    was certainly a lot of hope that the new regime that the students and the
                    popular reaction would sort of help keep things on track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Korea when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I left Korea in 1960, about mid year as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I had a quick trip back to the United States for home leave and I
                    got married at that time, within about two weeks of returning, which was a
                    little traumatic, because in those days you were lucky to get a telephone call
                    through from Korea with all the GIs who were waiting for the few circuits that
                    were available. Letters weren't always very reliable either. We had a very quick
                    two weeks to get reacquainted. My wife accused me of having a psychosomatic
                    disease. I think it was scary for her and for me since we had been apart as long
                    as we had been together. But, anyway we got married and after a very quick
                    honeymoon in the Blue Ridge we took off on the USS United States for,
                    indirectly, Liberia. We were able in those days to take the ship. It was a brand
                    new ship at that time. We crossed and we honeymooned in Scotland and England. We
                    flew from London to Stuttgart. We went to the Mercedes factory and we got a
                    diplomatic discount plus the reduction that came with picking up the car at the
                    factory. I paid just slightly, as I recall, $2,100 for a 190 SL, whatever it was
                    in those days, Mercedes, which is just a little bit more than I paid for my
                    Chevrolet two years before when I was in Korea. It was wild. Anyway, we drove
                    through Germany and France and England and Scotland and put the car on a ship
                    and flew to Liberia.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You flew to Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We flew to Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Liberia from 1960 till when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: 1962. We were there two years to the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Liberia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Very little. I was in the economic and commercial section and it
                    took a great deal of effort to figure out what one could usefully do. I was
                    number two in the section. The job consisted of writing world trade directory
                    reports on various Liberians firms and there were extremely few native Liberian
                    enterprises that were worth reporting on. Most of them were Lebanese and a good
                    deal of my time was spent chasing after Lebanese merchants who hadn't paid their
                    bills to American exporters. More often than not, I didn't find them or they had
                    only post office boxes addresses. Eventually, I notified the Commerce Department
                    that I was not going to do any WTDRs on any except the firms that I had
                    indicated were worthy of reporting on. They just wouldn't get any more from me
                    on these other businesses. I was very close to the Ford people and to some of
                    the academics who were there for various lengths of time. I always trying to
                    figure out what was going on in the economy. Firestone was there growing rubber
                    as well as Lamco which was a big iron mining venture - a huge venture that was
                    active, especially in the second year I was there. So, there was a fair amount
                    of mining minerals reporting and rubber. But, most of the American companies
                    that were there had been there forever and there was nothing that you could tell
                    them about Liberia that they didn't already know.</p>
                <p>There were a couple of other things, I did the first and only report that had
                    ever been done on the road network in Liberia, which was sort of nice. First of
                    all, it was important, because when you are opening roads you are opening the
                    economy. But, secondly it was also very convenient, because it gave my wife and
                    a reason to travel practically every weekend we could get away.</p>
                <p>Q: In the 1960-1962 period, things were really beginning to pop in Africa as far
                    as former colonies becoming independent. Liberia that has been independent for a
                    long time, but not very impressively. So, what was the situation in Liberia when
                    you were there?</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Independence has a very special meaning in Liberia. Independence
                    meant that the American Liberians were free of their bonds from the United
                    States. They were also free to exercise dominion over the people they called the
                    bush niggers. That pretty much typified the attitudes at that time. You had the
                    dramatic and colorful showmen, William Canarack, Shadrack, and William Tubman
                    who was the president assisted a little by William Tulbert who was the vice
                    president. I literally heard a state of the union address at which Tubman, the
                    politician that he was, admit that they were essentially exercising imperial
                    power over the tribes in Liberia, which constituted, I don't know, at least 90
                    percent of the population. No one tribe was large enough to be of any great
                    consequence, although there were a couple that were definitely larger than
                    others. There was virtually no tribal friction in those days at all. You began
                    to see the brief awakenings of a labor movement; there was some activity by a
                    couple of Liberians who were trying to be a more traditional labor relationship
                    types. Tubman quickly squelched that. Then, in one of the classic all time sorts
                    of nepotism, arrangements were made to put Tubman's son (or Tolbert's, I don't
                    remember) as made head of the labor union. At the same time, Tubman set up a
                    public relations firm which claimed certain privileged entre to the executive
                    mansion and, for a fee, arranged meetings for various American and foreign
                    investor companies with the president on any labor problems they might be
                    having. The notion of conflict of interest was very alive and well, but with a
                    new twist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We had a wonderful ambassador. His name was Albert G. Matthews. He
                    was tall and distinguished and about as diametrically opposite in character from
                    the Liberian style as you could imagine. He was quite courtly; he must have been
                    I guess, 6'2; grey mustache; just a really super guy. It was difficult to come
                    up with very much new at the staff meetings. The most memorable staff meeting I
                    recall is when we were discussing Tubman's various extramarital liaisons and
                    what ripples that might cause in U.S. relationships. I think he was having an
                    affair with the wife of the Liberian ambassador to the United States at that
                    time. That was about as dicey as it got. It was a period when there was some
                    ferment in Africa. We had next door to us Guinea, headed by Sekou Toure.</p>
                <p>While we were in Liberia, the Africans established the Organization of African
                    Unity. In any event, we had some very distinguished Africans who visited; so
                    that was a highlight of Liberia. I think as the senior independent country they
                    laid claim to the first meeting and that was quite distinguished.</p>
                <p>Q: I assume that almost all your contacts were with American Liberians. What was
                    their attitude towards the other countries that were becoming independent around
                    them?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was not a very good amateur sociologist, but I think it is fair
                    both then and now to interpret their behavior as basically stemming from an
                    incredible inferiority complex. I think many of them recognized that some of the
                    other African countries had benefitted from certain aspects of colonialism while
                    at the same time suffering from others. The American Liberians generally tended
                    to put on pretty haughty airs and were quite difficult to deal with. At the same
                    time I can't say enough about some of my Liberian colleagues, those who didn't
                    have to affect this kind of front and who were just really genuinely great
                    people to work with. I had very affectionate feelings toward those folks.</p>
                <p>Just a footnote. At some point in your assignment, you get pretty stir crazy,
                    even in a country that is 43 thousand square miles big. But, it was very easy.
                    So my wife and I took off on a 6,000 mile trip through West Africa by car. At
                    the time I planned the trip there were 33 ferry crossings. I think that we were
                    going to have to allow a half day for each of those. As it happened, there was
                    only one major ferry crossing by the time we got to Botswana. All of the
                    countries we transited were basically oriented from the coast inward for a
                    variety of reasons. One, there was usually a tensions between Liberia and the
                    Franco-speaking countries on two sides or with the English control of Sierra
                    Leone in another and that tended to be the case all along the coast.
                    Furthermore, there were huge tropical rivers which would have been very
                    expensive to bridge which meant that in order to get from one country to
                    another, you would drive from the coast virtually all the way as far inland,
                    then you would cross over to the next country and the then return to the coast
                    where the action was. We went from Liberia up through the Ivory Coast, Ghana,
                    Togo and Benin and then a big circuit through Nigeria. We didn't get up to
                    Ouagadougou as we had planned, because the roads were all washed out. That was
                    very interesting trip because we then were able to compare and contrast what was
                    going on in Liberia with other parts of Africa.</p>
                <p>Q: President Kennedy came in during the time you were there and Soapy Williams
                    had become the assistant secretary of the African Bureau and things. All of a
                    sudden a lot of young Foreign Service officers would say, “Wow, this is for me.
                    There are lots of countries and Africa is the future both from U.S. policy point
                    of view as well as from a career point of view”I would have thought that Liberia
                    would be sort be almost odd man out. Things weren't going to change there. How
                    did you all feel about it?</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I didn't feel that Liberia was necessarily less well positioned than
                    other countries along the coast with the exception of Nigeria, because
                    investments in Liberia by the time I left, were quite substantial. Lots of new
                    roads were being built; new rubber plantations were opening up; there was a lot
                    of small enterprises run by Liberians. They were spin offs from the rubber
                    plantations of Firestone, which was assisting them. Furthermore, a totally
                    disproportion of the amount of American aid was going to Liberia. There was no
                    reason to expect that Liberia was going to fare any less well and certainly
                    probably better than places like Guinea or Upper Volta and Ghana was certainly
                    questionable under Kwame Nkrumah. Ghana was lavishing tons of money on the show
                    place universities. Nothing much else was going on. I didn't feel that Liberia
                    was being left behind.</p>
                <p>I also was privileged to make a lot of visits to the hinterlands with a wonderful
                    guy who was the education advisor for AID. I was overwhelmed by the incredibly
                    thin layer of education and confidence that I perceived. I had the same
                    impression throughout West Africa. So, I had very little expectation that West
                    Africa was going to gain any kind of stability or any kind of economic
                    sustainable growth, because the leadership was so incredibly vulnerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an immigration of African Americans from
                        thUnited States to look for their roots or did this come later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: There were some very sad cases of that. It wasn't a big rush. Of
                    course, the Marxist garden movement had been active a long time. They went back
                    on a communal basis to try to set up communities in Africa. They really were odd
                    people who came back and more often than not were just totally estranged from
                    the kind of society that existed in Liberia.</p>
                <p>I might just note some of the peculiarities of Liberia - the things that were
                    really different. One of the audacities of the American Liberian society was
                    that it took so many things from its American experiences which it then grafted
                    them on the local society. They took the Masonic rights with them and then they
                    grafted it on top of native secret societies. There was a lot of black magic and
                    occasional cases of cannibalism or rights that were associated with the secret
                    societies. They got inter mixed and I think some of the African Americans were
                    spooked by threats of black magic and a variety of other secret society
                    activities. A couple of them cracked up and others went back to the U.S. very
                    disillusioned by what they had found.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I would say probably 75 percent of the really amusing Foreign Service stories
                    took place in Liberia. One of my tasks was to analyze the Liberian budget. Among
                    other things there was a passing interest in what they spent on defense. As I
                    was going through the budget one day I noticed that they had an item for the
                    Liberian Navy. I didn't know anything about Liberian Navy. I started nosing
                    around to find out what I could about the Liberian Navy. It turned out that the
                    Liberian Navy was a euphuism for the President's yacht. At one point the
                    President's yacht was in need of restoration and so they sent it off to England
                    to be refitted and upgraded. The day came for the return of the “Navy” and the
                    yacht was greeted by crowds on the docks. The port of Monrovia was built by
                    Americans as thanks for the World War II use of the Liberian air bases But it
                    was a very long break water with a relatively narrow opening. The break water
                    was on two sides. It so happened that at this time there were a lot of heavy
                    freighters going in and out with iron ore and other commodity cargoes. As usual,
                    things were a little behind schedule and the ship didn't shown up. So there were
                    ships coming and going and there was one particularly large ship which was
                    heading out the exit of the port Just as it reached the exit of the port the
                    “Navy” rounded into sight and there was a collision. The “Navy” was off budget
                    for the next two years.</p>
                <p>We ran into those were the kinds of things— it was wild. We just had a great time
                    traveling around and learning about the different tribes and visiting the
                    missionaries. D.J. Hayes was the education specialist who was such a prince and
                    very well known throughout the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got ready to leave in 1962, did you have any
                        desire tbecome an African specialist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I went in to the Foreign Service with my main interest being in
                    Asia. There was nothing I saw in Africa in my two years there that changed that
                    interest in the tiniest little bit. I felt the culture; we traveled around with
                    a cultural anthropologist quite a bit and I was just not socially or
                    temperamentally attuned to stay around in that part of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in 1962?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We rushed home to permit my wife to give birth to our first child.
                    She was certified to be in her third trimester which means that she could have
                    been up to nine months pregnant as far as the airline was concerned. But, anyway
                    we got back and two weeks later she gave very swift birth to our daughter before
                    I could even get from the office to the hospital. After that, I went tMIT.
                    First, I had a short course at FSI - a sort of preliminary economics course for
                    MIT. Of course, I had an undergraduate degree in economics; so I was extremely
                    pleased to be going to MIT - that was my first choice for my next
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a year's course?</hi>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. Unfortunately it took two years to get a masterin economics at
                    MIT; so I didn't have a chance to get a degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a special course at MIT?</hi>

                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: This was the precursor to the economics course that FSI eventually
                    set up. At this time, the Department used universities for training and I think
                    economics was the principle area. Economic assistance was the big and growing
                    activity at that time and I think the Department knew that it had a shortage of
                    economists, although it was never clear in later years that they were quite sure
                    what to do with economists when they had them. I was part of the Department's
                    effort to bolster its economic knowledge. I felt fortunate having had economics,
                    because many who were sent to graduate economics schools had undergraduate
                    degrees in economics. It was a terrific opportunity for me, because MIT had the
                    best economics department in the country as far as I was concerned. It was
                    great, but it was also probably the hardest year that we spent in the Foreign
                    Service. It was tough on my wife raising a tiny baby in basement apartment in
                    winter in Boston. I was taking courses that presumed previous calculus
                    knowledge, but I hadn't had it; so I was taking calculus at the same time. That
                    was challenging.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Right. At that point I realized the benevolence of the State
                    Department personnel system because despite that I was still a very junior
                    officer, I was offered a choice of three assignments. But, of course it was
                    possible to be a little bit cynical about those, because the choices were
                    Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I asked for Asia. I guess we took a day or two to think about it,
                    but it wasn't really too hard. I opted for Vietnam, which was a wise choice,
                    because if we had chosen to go to Cambodia, our household effects would have
                    been on their way to Nam Pen and we would have been evacuated the day we
                    arrived.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1963 was a rather crucial year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We got to San Francisco and discovered that Pan Am had not made the
                    hotel reservations that we thought they would, so we wound up sleeping on
                    benches at the airport that night because there was nothing available within 50
                    miles of the airport. An over-zealous guard kept coming around and waking us up
                    and waking the baby up, so we would move and then try and find some place where
                    he couldn't find us. We were in miserable shape when we got on board of our
                    plane. When we picked up the newspaper, the headline was that martial law had
                    been declared and that the Saigon airport was closed. We were alerted two and a
                    half hours before we got to Tokyo that the hydraulic system was out and that the
                    crew would have to use a manual breaking process; they gave us lurid description
                    how we should protect ourselves on landing, in view of the likelihood of fire
                    and all those good things. So, when we got to Tokyo we were not in excessively
                    great humor and we had to cool our heels for three days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I guess it was June of 1963. I was in Saigon from 1963 to November
                    1965. In any event, we spent three days cooling our heels in Tokyo that were un-
                    programmed We finally left on either the same flight or the flight immediately
                    after the ambassador's. It was Cabot Lodge who had just been appointed
                    ambassador. I guess we were on the plane immediately after the one that brought
                    Lodge. Things were not too cozy in Saigon at that time. American personnel was
                    under such suspicion by the Vietnamese that they had been ordered not to
                    associate or have any contacts with their American counterparts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Because of suspicion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of suspicion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The regime suspected that Americans were up to no good and were
                    plotting against President Nguyen Van Thieu and his wife, Madam Thieu. They were
                    trying to prevent contacts and made whatever contacts existed more visible. So,
                    having arrived in June, we had a couple of months where we had literally no
                    contact with any Vietnamese officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job at the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was in the AID mission in the program division. I was in the
                    office of economic policy which was responsible for assessing the needs of the
                    Vietnamese economy for supporting assistance - basically military support
                    assistance - which was designed to absorb the spending power - that was
                    generated by the Vietnamese printing presses - with commodities that Vietnam
                    needed to keep its economy going and to support AID projects, much like what I
                    did in Korea.</p>
                <p>Q: What were you getting from the people you were working with iAID and elsewhere
                    within the American mission abouVietnam and the Van Thieu regime and his
                    family?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Actually it was very much like picking up where I had left off in
                    Korea. As I said, we had virtually no contact with any Vietnamese with the
                    exception of a few locals who worked for AID. So, it was very difficult to find
                    out what the Vietnamese were thinking. But it was quite clear from contacts with
                    a lot of our American colleagues what was going on, because, of course, they had
                    their feelers out in all parts of the country. There was a provincial
                    representatives system at that time which required Americans to be in all of the
                    provinces of Vietnam, so it was relatively easy to get a feel pretty good feel
                    of what was going on in the country. It was a very depressing situation. We
                    arrived shortly after the first monk had emulated himself about a block and a
                    half down the street from where we lived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about Buddhist monks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Right. There were a lot of demonstrations and there had been a lot
                    of emulations. A new wave had begun and it wasn't long after we had arrived that
                    President Diem was, in fact, overthrown and killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting a feel about Ambassador Lodge's attitude
                        towarthe government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I think the impression was that he had come to talk tough to the
                    Vietnamese in an effort to get them to put their house in order. But I was
                    pretty cut off from the embassy and really didn't get a lot of inside scoop
                    about what was going on. I guess what disturbed me was the sense that the
                    autocratic management of the government seemed to be disappointing a lot of
                    people who normally would supported the government if they had been given a
                    chance to do so. I can't now recall what was wishful thinking and what was
                    suspected with regard to Lodge's job there.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Q: You were part of the program to try and absorb the surplus currency. I came
                    there in 1969 and we were cursing that Vietnam was awash with consumer goods
                    mainly Japanese, like little Honda motor bikes and other thing; it seemed to be
                    a hell of a way to running a war with all these consumer goods flooding the
                    country. What was the feeling at the time you were there on what was being done;
                    how was it being done; and what was your impression of that?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: At the time I arrived and for about six months at least, very little
                    was being done; things were chaotic situation. I was trying to learn the whole
                    of the macro- economics of the country and so, I wasn't so involved with the
                    non-project assistance program and what was going on mechanically. Basically we
                    were just trying to do the best we could with the ministry of finance to figure
                    out what was happening in terms of inflationary pressures and what was going to
                    be needed in the countryside to meet the essential needs. We were trying to keep
                    the production processes running as best as could be to avoid having to import
                    still more than we already were. Obviously, in incredibly rich agricultural
                    areas, there was a lot done to focus on the agriculture, but efforts were also
                    being made to try and build up the Vietnamese capacity to produce expendables
                    for the military. So, our focus was really not at all on the consumer economy;
                    it was on the productive element of the economy. The visible consumerism that
                    existed was much more associated in my mind with the PXs and the GIs who started
                    pouring into Saigon after Kennedy's assassination. That was really quite
                    visible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you and what were you doing when November 1963
                        wheDiem was overthrown and he and his brother killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was living not very far from the U.S. AID building and therefore
                    my life consisted basically of going back and forth from home to the office with
                    a lot of alerts in terms of disturbances and things of that sort. We practically
                    backed on one of the Buddhist temples that was the scene of a lot of the
                    politics; there was a great deal of disruption of life. I learned to ride a
                    motorcycle because I figured that was the safest, quickest and best way to
                    commute. Our lives were very unsettled and there were a lot of worries. My wife
                    was teaching out near the airport and there were a lot of concerns about family
                    security. In fact, we had three very close calls with the family in relatively a
                    short period of time. Even once things begin to ease up, unless you had very
                    good reason, I didn't travel outside of Saigon very much. There was no way for
                    me to do what I had done in Korea, which was really to get out and get to know
                    the countryside. It was very clustered, sort of catastrophic existence. When we
                    did venture out, we encountered three rather close calls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of? How?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The first one involved one of the first incidence of a VC kidnapping
                    of an American, a guy who I had come to know, Guy Serts. We had gone out to the
                    edge of Saigon for the idle task of picking up some of the sculptured plants
                    that the Vietnamese were adept at creating .We had gone to a particular block on
                    the edge of town and bought a couple of plants for the stoop and came back; we
                    were enjoying them until we picked up the paper the next day and discovered that
                    Guy Serts had been kidnaped from the very block that we had been shopping in.
                    The exact same location.Then although we weren't directly involved in the
                    theater, there was a grenade thrown into the theater and a soldier threw himself
                    on the grenade which protected everyone else but killed himself.</p>
                <p>A third incidence was when we took some Vietnamese friends - a family with whom I
                    had become close to in my official work - for a Sunday lunch including a ride on
                    the river on an embassy lunch Clueneteek where the French used to water ski.
                    When we got back someone asked if we had been shot at. We said, no. They said,
                    “Well, they were just shooting there.” Apparently, the VC were on the far bank
                    and were shooting at the water skiers and the motor boats a little while
                    earlier. So, that seemed to be a dubious past time, too.</p>
                <p>Then, I guess it was after the family left, I was literally within three blocks
                    of the embassy when it was blown up. We began to take these things a little bit
                    personally after awhile.</p>
                <p>Q: After the assassination of Diem, there began a revolving door in the
                    government. What were you doing? Did things open up more; there wasn't much to
                    see?</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: That is an interesting story, because we used to invite some of the
                    provincial representatives in to our house when they would come into Saigon for
                    weekends. We were sort of a local watering hole for people who came back from
                    the provinces. I very quickly became disenchanted with what I was doing in the
                    office and started talking to my colleagues and we decided that we would
                    undertake a little project assessing how economic development might be conducted
                    under conditions of warfare on military action. We set up a little cross
                    disciplinary group with somebody from the military, and somebody from AID, and
                    somebody from the embassy, a couple of different agencies and we started
                    meeting. My boss didn't like this. He told me that I would have to do this on my
                    own time; the project had nothing to do with what we were supposed to be doing
                    in the office. So I did that. Eventually, I would spend weekends in a province
                    that we selected where we could observe the situation to see what the conditions
                    were and to try to see if we could figure out some answers. We picked Tangin
                    Providence, because it was sort of a transitional province between the north and
                    the south. We used to make frequent trips to look at the province program and
                    work with the AID program to see what was being planned for the province. We
                    very quickly begin to see that it was hard to divorce that from what was being
                    done with the military management. We became quite disillusioned with the way
                    the military operations were being run. So, we began to try to push some new
                    policies even though we were all were junior officers in various agencies. We
                    begin to develop some fairly elaborate plans for the province. The military was
                    very fascinated by this and they invited us to make a presentation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. At this point my boss saw a way of burnishing his credentials a
                    little bit by letting me spend some of my office time on this project. As I
                    said, we became very frustrated with some of the military operations and started
                    developing some proposals to change some of the way things were being done. We
                    would meet and we would decide which agency was likely to be most receptive to a
                    particular idea and then we would propose our idea to that agency. We would all
                    be alert to position ourselves to respond. We would usually try to cast the
                    proposals in such a way that we were sure it would end up on the action list. We
                    begin to have some interesting success at trying to get some relatively minor
                    things changed from the way things were being done. We became aware of the three
                    wars that were being fought and developed a rather strong partiality to the
                    things that were being done in fighting one of the wars over the way things were
                    done fighting in the other wars. We became more and more involved with
                    critiquing the military activities in Vietnam and eventually I became totally
                    disillusioned with what was being done with the military forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I guess General Harkins was there when I first arrived and he was quite notorious
                    for cooking the numbers, no negative reports and so on. Among the things we
                    became painfully aware of were just how completely misleading the reports that
                    were coming from headquarters. When you got an honest report from a provincial
                    military advisor, it wasn't getting through; that was very disillusioning.</p>
                <p>Q: One person I interviewed was saying that he was there when Harkins left and
                    Westmoreland took over. He said that Harkins had the staff draw up a list
                    showing all the successes; when Westmoreland came, he had the staff draw up a
                    list the failures in order to build a benchmark so he could later show how he
                    had improved matters. All the same matters were on both lists, except in
                    reverse. What was the problem, as you saw it as an economist looking at what the
                    military was doing?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: What we saw happening was that there would be Viet Cong attacks on
                    various hamlets or villages and the ARVIN (army of the Republic of
                    Vietnam)forces would either not bother the show up or often they would be
                    ambushed and severely beaten and retreat before they ever got there. The
                    subsequent evidence and the scuttle- butt was that there were lots of spies
                    inside the ARVIN and therefore the army was extremely vulnerable. Consequently,
                    the result was that the villages, if anything, got a little mortar cover and
                    that was about as much as they could hope for. The other activity that you had
                    going on were the green berets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were our special forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: They were special forces. They were working with in small units,
                    independent of any regular forces, basically as guerilla force to counter the
                    guerilla activities of the VC. We also haCIA assisted village and popular
                    forces, provided support under AID auspices. To us, it made sense to support the
                    village and popular forces and to expand the green beret activities so that they
                    could get behind the enemy lines, where such existed. We could combat the enemy
                    with these forces—probably even better than using regular Vietnamese and
                    American ground troops—and at the same time, gather village and hamlet support.
                    As the military assessed their program later they found out that of the officers
                    who graduated from their training courses the top three officers almost
                    invariably defected or disappeared. It was their military operating procedures
                    which friends and foes alike knew. The ARVIN was just so badly infiltrated that
                    it was just hopeless. So, we became increasingly supporters of the war that was
                    being prosecuted by the CIA with the hamlet forces and green berets and wanted
                    that effort enlarged. After Kennedy's death, the green berets lost their luster.
                    They were very much mistrusted and detested by the regular military; so it
                    didn't take long to undercut and undermine the green beret activity, which I
                    thought was a great tragedy. Furthermore, the U.S. forces were coming in
                    over-equipped for the job that they had to do, which meant that the VC were able
                    to arm themselves with weaponry that was much more suited against U.S. forces
                    than it was against them. They picked up 50 caliber machine guns and were able
                    to start shooting down choppers and planes; it was just a nightmare. We quickly
                    became convinced that much, if not most, of what we were doing with the regular
                    forces was simply building up support for VC by alienating the villagers where
                    the ARVIN had ran over the roughshod thereby disillusioning the locals.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. The Tonkin Gulf incident precipitated evacuations. That
                    happened about a year and a half after we got there. It was about February 1965
                    as I recall.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Since I was expecting to go to a completely location after Vietnam,
                    we decided it made more sense to evacuate them back to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of AID operations? Did they
                        change whilyou were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: They evolved rather radically as the military build-up occurred. I
                    am not quite clear when there was some restructuring of the provincial
                    representatives function. At some point, they changed the whole structure and I
                    don't really have the details of that at my grasp. But the AID process did not
                    change a lot. We were still providing defense support funds and we were still
                    trying to build up plants, more and more of which tended to get cloistered
                    around Saigon as the military areas in the rest of Vietnam became more tenuous.
                    Basically, I was so preoccupied with the general interaction of the military and
                    the AID programs that that was what I focused on just exclusively. As I said, we
                    started with our little group to do everything we could possibly do to promote
                    the village and hamlet popular forces because that it seemed to be the only
                    possible way to achieve our goals. At the village level you could expect that
                    while there might be a some infiltration it was likely to be known. I guess what
                    was most over- whelming was the preoccupation by Washington with statistics body
                    count - the McNamara approach to winning the war with numbers which was just
                    incredibly frustrating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that continue up through when you left in 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. I went back to Washington then. I'll have to double check
                    again, because my memory on the dates is a bit fuzzy. I was back in Washington
                    in 1965, but basically I spent most of my time back in Vietnam. One of my
                    principle tasks was recruiting people for the economic and program functions in
                    Vietnam. In the Washington frenzy to win the war; the Johnson years were filled
                    with just crazy proposals. We spent a lot of our time trying to argue against
                    some of the more outlandish ones.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The mentality that took over was that people in the field weren't
                    using enough imagination. So Washington tried to throw resources at the
                    problems. Washington was trying to come up with ideas - which people wouldn't
                    consider or which wouldn't have been considered in Saigon and in Vietnam.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: You earlier referred to the revolving door. There was just a
                    constant exchange of leaders and no real conviction that any of them had a
                    strong grip. Big men seemed to be a very imposing type, but they certainly
                    didn't change things just as little men didn't change things. Tal Key, the Air
                    Force general, that didn't do any better, but was at least more colorful about
                    it, but essentially we just seemed to be moving nowhere. The ARVIN were
                    afflicted by their constant susceptibility to being out-flanked and ambushed
                    with their weapons stolen. Basically, they were sort of a supply depot for the
                    VC, it seemed. It was not an encouraging scene. It was just hard to see any way
                    out. The irony of Vietnam was that there were so many people in Vietnam who were
                    sincerely and deeply concerned about the outcome, that it was very hard not to
                    feel terribly committed to try and do whatever one could do. It was like
                    watching the dike gradually giving way and you knew that ultimately you couldn't
                    do anything about it, but you wanted to save as much as you could while you were
                    there. We had a million plus Catholic refuges who had come down from the North;
                    there were whole sects that could and should have been fighting the VC, but who
                    were sometimes fighting against the government forces. There was always that
                    hope that somebody with some sense would come in and allow some local autonomy
                    and regain some support from those sects which were in a powerful position in
                    the areas they controlled. Eventually it became very apparent to me and to many
                    others that the costs of what was being done in the United States - in both
                    political and the economic - terms was just greatly outweighing any possible
                    benefit from our failing efforts in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You broke away from Vietnam in 1967?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was in the Vietnam Bureau in AID and as I say, my principle task
                    was to recruit people to go to Vietnam to serve either as program economists or
                    as program officers. The AID mission had quite a substantial need for program
                    officers at that point, because we were doing so much to support. Incidentally,
                    one of the things that I was doing was trying to see to it that funds got down
                    to the villages, so that they could carry out projects that were of primary
                    interest to them, rather than having all development being pushed from the
                    center downward. We spent a lot of time trying to work with the ministry of
                    finance and through the provincial governments to try to get money out of
                    Saigon; that was very difficult and never very successful.</p>
                <p>I felt great frustration doing the core activity to which I was assigned. It was
                    an interesting experience trying to recruit people for Vietnam, because I was
                    told that people were busy fighting a war, so they allowed me a lot of
                    authority. I was told that I would authority to assign people to Vietnam from
                    anywhere in the AID and if they choose not to go, then they would be terminated
                    - just as easy as that. I told my bosses that I wouldn't work on those terms,
                    but if they would accept my terms, I will be happy to do it. My terms were to
                    give them a third choice.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The third choice was that if they did not accept an assignment to Vietnam for the
                    two year period, they had to accept the assignment to what was then the Vietnam
                    Bureau in Washington, including a requirement to spend at least six months out
                    of the year on TDY in Saigon. I don't recall how many people I sent out - I
                    would guess 20 people - but I did not have to fire anyone, because they mostly
                    settled on my terms. We had an anti-war guy working in the bureau at that time.
                    On weekdays he would work in the AID office and on weekends he would go out and
                    demonstrate with his friends. We sent him out on a TDY to Vietnam; he had been
                    out there about two weeks when we got a message asking for a full duty
                    assignment there. It was just the result of going out there and seeing how many
                    people who were desperate to try and win the war on the South Vietnamese side.
                    It was just hard to walk away from it. I think that was basically what made the
                    TDY route attractive.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I had actually been designated to go to work foRichard Cooper who
                    was the deputy and secretary for international monetary affairs in the E
                    (Economic Affairs Bureau). I had been designated for that job when I returned
                    from Saigon, but AID had simply exercised its priority and insisted on my coming
                    back to work for the Office of Vietnamese Affairs. I fought the assignment to E,
                    but unsuccessfully and so I then went to work in the Office of International
                    Monetary Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in that office from 1967 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Until 1970.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The Officer of International Monetary Affairs is responsible for
                    developing the Department's positions on matters which were the primary
                    responsibility of the Treasury Department and AID at that time and possibly some
                    other agencies. The office had two branches at that time; one had to do with the
                    broader international monetary affairs; and the other dealt with monetary
                    affairs for the less developed countries. So, I was not preoccupied with U.S.
                    developmental policies toward the developing world. I particularly wanted to go
                    in to the office that was responsible for the international monetary operations
                    of the United States. I was interested in that because a lot was happening with
                    the impact of the Vietnam war on the devaluation of the dollar. There were a lot
                    going on in 1967 and 1968; e.g. the currency crisis, international currency
                    crisis, U.S. balance of payment deficit. I wanted to find out what it was all
                    about, because this was just an area in which I hadn't had a lot of experience.
                    A great deal of what we had to do in the office was about as far away from
                    Vietnam as you could imagine. It was assessing what was happening in the global
                    monetary field - what kind of exchange rate structure we should have. Should we
                    have a floating rate system or moving pegs and fixed rates with periodic
                    readjustments? We were also involved in a lot of World War II death claims and
                    other miscellany.</p>
                <p>Q: I would have thought that there would be a real bureaucratic war between the
                    State Department and the Treasury Department over monetary matters, because the
                    State Department tends to look about what U.S. policy will do to other
                    countries. The Treasury Department looks about what will this do to the United
                    States. Did you find that the Treasury had a different attitude than that which
                    existed iState?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Generally speaking, the State Department's attitude didn't matter,
                    because Treasury was so totally overwhelmingly dominant in this field. But that
                    situation was changing and that was one of the things that made the job exciting
                    at the time I was there. The relationship between the two departments changed
                    quite substantially because when you have persons of the intellectual caliber of
                    Richard Cooper and Tony Salomon they are bound to make an impact. Cooper had
                    been one of the youngest professors at Yale while I was there. Anthony “Tony”
                    Solomon had came in as assistant secretary for the E Bureau. Between the two of
                    them they were a very powerful force. For the first time in quite a while,
                    people were inviting Tony Solomon or Dick Cooper to meetings and sometimes that
                    even filtered down to the director of my office. It was very fascinating. I
                    don't know how much you want to get into personalities, but they were
                    important.</p>
                <p>Q: I do, because one of the great strengths I think this oral history program is
                    that it brings out the personalities and the effect they have on foreign
                    affairs.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I hesitated doing that earlier, but I would like to return
                    momentarily to Vietnam, because among the people I came to know and I worked
                    with in Vietnam were Dick Holbrook who was a provincial rep at that point and
                    Tony Lake who also was a provincial rep. There were also a number of military
                    people who also were very impressive. Both of those acquaintances would turn out
                    to be interesting later on in my career.</p>
                <p>As I said, Richard Cooper was the deputy assistant secretary for international
                    monetary affairs. I became the office director for international monetary
                    affairs. It was quite fascinating to work with him. The reason I was so
                    interested in going into international monetary affairs was that I basically saw
                    myself at that point as a developmental economist. I was interested in the
                    development process in Asia and recognized that these countries were very much
                    dominated by the whole international monetary structure that basically directed
                    by the IMF and the OECD and other international bodies. I wanted this assignment
                    as background for understanding what was going on in this are.</p>
                <p>Among other things we mounted a special mission with the general responsible for
                    logistics and went back to Vietnam at one point to look at the currency and
                    inflation problems of Vietnam. That was about a year after I had left the
                    Vietnam Bureau. So again I did a little doubling back on Vietnam. I might also
                    mention that when I became director of the office or slightly before that, we
                    had in E a young Civil Service employee come in by the name of Fred Bergsten who
                    has since gone on to much bigger and better things that I ever went onto. It was
                    stimulating to work with Fred. He was obviously immensely bright and extremely
                    effective. So, we had a pretty strong team with the combination of Fred - I
                    don't know how to include myself in that—, Dick Cooper and Tony Solomon. With
                    them, the State Department became fairly heavy players in the international
                    monetary affairs. There were a number of times during which there were currency
                    crises; we would have meetings over at the Treasury some of which I attended
                    with Tony and Paul Volker who was then assistant secretary of the Treasury
                    anDewey Dane and others at the Federal Reserve Board. There were some fairly
                    intense meetings about what U.S. monetary policy should be and particularly what
                    our policy on exchange rates should be. All that is quite interesting in
                    retrospect, because at that point I am sure that our balance payment deficit was
                    a relatively small fraction compared with what it became later on. It was a
                    testing period for the international monetary system.</p>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: My recollection of that is that everybody was really preoccupied
                    with the technical attributes of the various systems and what the economic
                    ramifications were. There was no particular parochial interest being reflected
                    as far as I could determine. The discussion were on the technical merits of
                    doing one thing as opposed to another and I don't think that there were any
                    particular predetermined positions. I think it was a period when all of the old
                    ground rules were thrown out the window and we were trying to figure out what
                    the changed world circumstances would mean to the U.S.—this was the period of
                    the OPEC oil shocks and all. It was a wild time in international monetary
                    affairs.</p>

                    the work was all done in the technical bureau. He may have been involved, I
                    don't know, I can't say that, but I don't ever recall preparing materials for

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: No, I think not. We were already in sort of a floating, semi
                    floating, moving peg system by that time. One other dimension of what we were
                    doing that became quite important was, this was a period when some assessed that
                    the Americans were going to overwhelm Europe. In that in this respect there was
                    a rivalry with Treasury. I was convinced that we were giving far too little
                    attention in the Department to U.S. foreign direct investment. By this time Tom
                    Andrews had come in as deputy assistant secretary and I pushed for the better
                    part of the year to have an office of international investment affairs set up
                    under his authority. He never agreed to it. He didn't feel that it was that
                    important, but soon after we left, it was set up. It was long over due and at
                    the time I originally proposed it, it would have been a great opportunity for
                    the State Department to take the lead in a little niche area that Treasury was
                    completely or seemed quite disinterested in. So I became was very aware of the
                    weakness of the Department in its ability to play a leading role.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: There were a great many ramifications that the people were not
                    totally clear about. The question of whether we were exporting jobs; what the
                    impact was there on the U.S. balance of payments at this kind of activity;
                    whether there were various conditions being applied to foreign direct investment
                    in some cases by the developed countries and in other cases much more so by the
                    developing countries. A question of how the United States should deal with what
                    had subsequently came to be called the trade related investment systems which
                    requires the investor either put a plant up in the country or to export X
                    percent of his production. There were lots and lots of issues. The international
                    economic impact of foreign direct investment was really at the very early stages
                    of rapid development and assessment. Then, of course, there were all the issues
                    associated with the OPEC and the oil investments - alternative energy sources-.
                    There was just an incredible variety of stuff going on.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any concern at the time that the European economic community as it
                    developed, might not be a particularly good thing for the United States. In that
                    we might be excluded or be made less competitive with them on the market. Was
                    that a concern at that time?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Suspicions were in the wings. I think it was sort of a minority
                    concern focusing especially on the common agricultural program. The main
                    preoccupation was that, in this particular sector, the Europeans were really
                    totally out of control at that point. They were locked into a system that
                    threatened to do severe financial damage to the community and was certainly
                    detrimental to our interest. But, I think the agricultural sector was viewed as
                    an exception and an aberration; generally speaking we thought the Europeans were
                    yet to be encouraged to do still more. There was an associated concern that in
                    the foreign investment area they might start imposing some conditions and
                    restrictions on U.S. foreign investment, but that was seen as a sort of new
                    thing that could be dealt with on its own terms and on its own time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
                        Countries)viewed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: OPEC created an effective cartel which affected both the developed
                    and the whole developing world, premising their polices on the notion that they
                    had been had been tricked by the developed world. That began whole idea that a
                    new economic policy should be developed to establish a series of cartels,
                    imitating OPEC, in order to try to get a fairer deal for what the commodity
                    production. This was also a period of the Club of Rome, if I recall correctly,
                    which came to the conclusion that the world would simply exhaust all the
                    resources of the world over some visible period and create economic
                    catastrophe.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Obviously OPEC was a major problem for us and we spent quite a bit of time
                    focusing on what the Middle East was doing. The biggest challenge for the Office
                    of International Monetary Affairs was generated when a part of the world created
                    a cartel, which then was able to extort tremendous amount of income from the
                    rest of the world and run up huge, huge surpluses. The normal international
                    adjustment to that situation is that the producers' currencies go up in value
                    and the rest of the world's currencies go down in value until a balances is
                    restored. That would have necessitated such a tremendous depreciation of the
                    U.S. dollar at that time, that it was considered a non-viable option; that gave
                    rise to the effort to assure that the petro-dollars (or oil dollars) would be
                    recycled as aid, or loans, or credit, or balance of payment support, or any
                    number of programs which would result was in a less hostile relationship. As
                    long as the producing countries were cooperating in recycling these surplus
                    funds and preventing or precluding the kind of dramatic exchange rate that it
                    would have resulted otherwise, the cartel did not pose any monetary problems.
                    But it clearly led in to a period of great tensions and probably generated the
                    worst period of relationships between the developing and the developed worlds at
                    that point, because OPEC's actions basically dramatized to the world that trade
                    for agricultural and mineral products had been deteriorating in favor of the
                    goods of the industrial world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1970, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I then went to the Brookings Institute for a year. I had an
                    opportunity to take a federal executive fellowship. I had proposed to the
                    Institute that a study of U.S. foreign investment and its implications for U.S.
                    economic interests be undertaken. Unfortunately, that was probably the least
                    successful, the least productive period of my Foreign Service career . Partly,
                    it was my fault because I wasn't more aggressive in finding somebody at
                    Brookings who might interested in this issue. Consequently, I really didn't have
                    a mentor there. I spent most of my time in the Department's library and in other
                    libraries and very little time at Brookings, which was most regrettable. The
                    Institute didn't really provide any facilities or give me any real sense that I
                    had a home there; so the year was kind of a downer. I did make one very
                    interesting discovery about which I tried to write an article for publication,
                    but was unsuccessful at that. I discovered that there was a lot of
                    under-reported American investment. I made some estimates as to just how
                    substantial this was and it was something like one-third higher than was ever
                    shown in the official statistics for a number of technical reasons that had to
                    do with the way the Commerce Department kept the numbers. My year at Brookings
                    was a year of education, but it didn't lead anywhere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was then assigned as head of the economic ancommercial section of
                    our embassy in Indonesia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was there from 1971 to 1975.</p>
                <p>Q: Now this is six years after Sukarno had been eased out and was replaced by
                    Suharto who is still in charge. Can you describe how you saw Indonesia in 1971
                    and any changes that occurred during your tour?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Indonesia figured to be a very exciting place to go, because with
                    the advent of Suharto, the U.S. was able to resume its economic aid. There was
                    essentially a policy of doing away with the Indonesian policy to bulling its
                    neighbors and pursing a lot of selfish nationalistic interests. It was assumed
                    that Indonesia would resolve all frictions with its neighbors would develop a
                    cooperative spirit in the area. Therefore not only was Indonesia working
                    intensively on economic development, but there was also the beginnings of the
                    Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). I was very keenly interested in
                    the prospect for regional development. When I began as economic counselor there,
                    there were abou45 to 50 American companies working in Indonesia. When I left
                    there four years later there had been over 250 American companies established in
                    Indonesia. So, it was a period in which there was a great deal of U.S.
                    investment interest and activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time? I imagine there were

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Frank Galbraith was the ambassador when we arrivethere.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of how the Embassy was run? As a counselor of embassy
                    you were part of the country team and you were part of the executive arm of the
                    embassy. How was it run when you arrived and were there any changes during your
                    tour?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We had a pretty substantial operation. We were in still the glory
                    days of AID; so there was a very large AID mission in Jakarta at that time.
                    There was also quite substantial military assistance program run by our the
                    military mission. USIA was fairly substantial. So, the embassy was not a small
                    one; in fact it was quite large with varied activities. In a country of then 70
                    million people we were a major player. The ambassador seemed to run a good ship.
                    He was interested in matters pretty much across the board. He was very business
                    oriented; it was not difficult to arrange meetings with him for visiting
                    significant business visitors. I really didn't have any I didn't have a solid
                    benchmark for comparing how an embassy was run, but it seemed to be we had top
                    drawer staff in all areas. It was just a very professional operation as far as I
                    could see.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government of Suharto like from your economic
                        ancommercial perspective at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: When I first arrived, I had to learn to appreciate how extensively
                    and deeply ingrained the socialist mentality was in Indonesia. Suharto had
                    something like 120 ministers and just an incredibly complex governmental
                    structure. He ruled by decree, so the whole thing was pretty much of a nightmare
                    when American companies arrived—often with their lawyers. The Indonesians were
                    pretty sporadic and dyspeptic about which things to enforce and which things not
                    to. It was very hard to sort of persuade people that lawyers were not
                    necessarily. The issues were not legal, but companies had to out what how the
                    game is played. Basically, there were the politics of Indonesia which Suharto
                    was quite masterful at managing in terms of keeping the revolving door going in
                    the military so that no one was able to establish a little fiefdom might
                    challenge his political primacy. At the same time he had the wisdom to employ a
                    group of outstanding technocrats mostly with U.S. PhD. training in Brooklyn and
                    MIT and half dozen other outstanding US educational institutions. They were
                    clearly fighting tough up-hill battle against the bureaucracy. When you have a
                    bureaucracy as extensive as it was in Indonesia and when you had as much
                    opportunity for discretionary decision- making as existed then, the corruption
                    problems and the problems that Americans had to deal with were just horrific
                    across the board. At the same time it was quite clear that the technocrats
                    recognized these problems and were trying to nibble away at them. Generally,
                    they got support on the important issues from the president, even if it
                    sometimes ran against his political interests. There was also sort of a second
                    government if you will, in the hands of General Evenosuetoa who was the
                    president or, director- general, oPermenena which was the state oil monopoly
                    with the growing investment and activity in oil and later in natural gas. He had
                    his hands on, not only on the oil taps, but on the money taps. So, he became
                    increasingly a power in his own right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself getting whip-sawed between the
                        two?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. I guess I should give a little flavor of what the economics
                    section involved at that time. Of course, we had a substantial commercial
                    component to it, but one of our officers was the petroleum reporting officer;
                    another officer was covering minerals, other than petroleum and others were
                    focused on more general and commercial matters. I had a particularly aggressive
                    and dynamic petroleum officer. We were able to keep tabs on what was happening
                    quite well, and to be quite influential, I think. We had some very aggressive
                    American banks who were increasingly willing to lend to the government on a
                    sovereign risk basis and Permanena in particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me. Could you explain what a sovereign risk basis
                        is?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. A loan on which you are not looking to the potential success of
                    a particular project or necessarily even to the financial stability of the
                    country as a whole, but to the expectation that the government would not permit
                    default and tarnish its name and ability to borrow further in the market place.
                    Basically the banks were counting onon the government to bail out any problems
                    if they happen to occur.</p>
                <p>Gradually, as Permanena became more and more of a cash cow for the Indonesian
                    economy, banks began to see the oil monopoly as a sovereign risk in of itself
                    and began to loan to Permanena for various projects. At the same time, Suharto
                    was quite happy to task General Ignew with carrying out certain projects that he
                    didn't see any particular way to finance in other ways. He didn't worry and he
                    didn't ask Ignew how he was going to get the money to do it, and so some of the
                    banks begin to finance some of this kind of project as well, figuring that
                    eventually the oil money would be there to pay for it. The IMF and we in the
                    embassy got very nervous about the levels of foreign debt that the combination
                    of the Indonesian government and Permanena were beginning to amass.</p>
                <p>I am going to get a little bit technical here for a few minutes because the story
                    is fairly spectacular. We began to notice that some of the smaller regional
                    banks got wind of this; they also began to see Indonesia as a gravy train; so
                    some of them came in and made some rather generous loans. The margin of risk
                    interest that Indonesia was paying over the lending inter-bank operating rate
                    was very thin for a country as much uncertainty as it had. Some of the banks
                    began to put in what were called “cross default provisions” on their loans so
                    that their loan would be declared in default, not only if the government failed
                    for some reason to make their payment to them on time, but if anybody else's
                    loan in this cross default structure was not met on time. For example, the
                    Republic National Bank of Dallas, if I recall correctly, had in its agreement
                    with Indonesia a cross default provision which included loans to Permanena,
                    which meant that - and other banks had similar provisions - if Republic were not
                    paid, the whole structure could collapse and everybody could come in with their
                    chips.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Probably about 1974, Permanena's borrowing had just really got out of hand and
                    rumors begin to circulate that Permanena had stopped sending its oil revenues to
                    the government and that there was the danger that these loans would be in
                    default. I went to see the governor of the Central Bank and we discussed what
                    this situation was. I met with him several times; it finally became clear that
                    Permanena was going to default or had defaulted on a payment to Republic
                    National Bank of Dallas. I went to see the governor of the Central Bank again to
                    determine what his position was on this. Was the government, in fact, going to
                    see to it that this debt was repaid or were they going to bail out. If they
                    were, what were the consequences for the Indonesian government, the AID programs
                    and all other issues of this kind. The up-shot was that the Central Bank
                    governor told me that the government, off the record, was not going to let the
                    default take place. But, he also told me that he was not going to make any
                    public statement to that effect. I told him that my understanding was that all
                    banks were about to call in all of their chips, unless they were reassured by
                    the governor that no default would be permitted. They didn't want to be last in
                    the line; they wanted to be first so they didn't wind up short. Things got very
                    dicey. I had a couple of very late night, early morning lengthy meetings with
                    the Japanese embassy minister-counselor as they had a lot at stake in this as
                    well. I went to see the governor again and I told the governor that, I
                    understood clearly why he did not want to indicate that he was going to bail
                    Permanena out of this or any other loans. I told him however that he were
                    willing to give me his personal assurance that the Central Bank would not permit
                    this default to occur, I was in a position to get the U.S. banks to accept his
                    pledge ,as transmitted to them through me, which would restrain them from
                    declaring a default. Fortunately, he agreed to do that. I was able to report
                    back to the banks that the governor had personally assured me that he was not
                    going to allow any defaults and for some reason he took it upon himself to trust
                    me to be the intermediator with that message. So, that was kind of an
                    interesting experience. It was a huge amount of money involved in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Indonesia get out of this fix?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: With a lot of encouragement and interest from the IMF. It really put
                    the clamps on General Ignew and several of his projects were either postponed or
                    canceled. Staff at Bopanas, which was the state planning agency, began to
                    investigate some of the deals that General Ignew had undertaken and found out to
                    no one's great surprise that there was a lot of water in these deals, particular
                    with a couple of European countries. Companies had, made some pretty scandalous
                    deals. They had to do some fast restructuring. Bopanas brought in some foreign
                    experts to help reshape and restructure some of the projects. This event really
                    scared the Indonesian government into recognizing that they had to get their
                    fiscal house in order; from that point on President Suharto backed off of giving
                    Ignew any more responsibilities. Eventually he was ousted, because of all the
                    diversions.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Q: I believe that by 1970 the Chinese business community had been pretty well
                    much decimated after Sukarno's earlier purge. What was the commercial side of
                    the Indonesian economy?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I don't know in terms of numbers what happened to the Chinese
                    community during the riots and the military suppressions following the “night of
                    the long knives.” When I arrived, I found a substantial and extremely
                    influential and basically dominant Chinese entrepreneurial class in place, which
                    was doing very well. In fact, it would be interesting to trace back just how
                    early this happened, but already from my very first days there it was well known
                    that the so-called Tukans, who were the Chinese business leaders, were very cozy
                    with Suharto. For example, Lens Sui Yang has been from that time to this very
                    day his principle economic agent. All of the biggest businesses were run by the
                    Chinese. There was a gradually emerging entrepreneurial class of native
                    Indonesians, but so many were Chinese-Indonesian. Most of them had reinvented
                    themselves with Indonesian names. This was not only true in business, but some
                    of the major think tanks were headed by or had major leadership from Chinese-
                    Indonesians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they intermarry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I never heard that described as a major means of integration.
                    Certainly the assimilation was not remotely what it was in Thailand, nor was it
                    quite the government supported conflict between the Chinese and the boomy pua
                    trap in Malaysia. It was a rather more a below the surface acquiescence to their
                    continued place n society even while the government was trying to do everything
                    it could administratively and programmatically to try to encourage and build-up
                    native businessmen. That has been a prolonged process.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there concern on anybody's part between, that the Americans investors were
                    essentially looking for cheap labor to do things that had been done in the
                    United States before? Was this a problem when you were there?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: That concern carried on from the earlier years that I had talked
                    about. The peak of that came in the mid 1960s when there were restrictions
                    placed on what American companies. But, that sort of died down. These developing
                    economies are so grossly inefficient and expensive to operate in that the only
                    kinds of goods that were being produced in Indonesia at that time those that
                    hadn't been produced in the States for quite a while. I refer to textiles, a
                    very limited amount of footwear, some basic chemical processing. Indonesia was
                    able to into raw material processing on a fairly large scale which also
                    minimized the job export issue, because you can't really prevent a developing
                    country from developing its own resources. I don't think that was a “job
                    exports” was a particularly big issue in the 1970s. The U.S. investments that
                    were being made - even to this day - predominantly for oil, natural gas and
                    mineral development. That does not raise the “job export” issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>OPIC (the overseas project investment corporation) had to do its own evaluation
                    whether it would provide any guarantees to U.S. investment based in part on the
                    issue of the potential adverse effect on U.S. balance of payments effect from
                    any project and in part of the political risk of supporting that investment.
                    That was about as much as there was. I don't recall that ever limited a U.S.
                    investment.</p>
                <p>There are a few more subjects that I would like to discuss in relations to my
                    tour in Indonesia. For example, the problems of income equity. We were at
                    various points very concerned about whether the regime would come unglued;
                    whether there was enough concern about the exploitation by the Suharto family
                    which had become quite apparent by that time; the importance of American
                    investment; the competition with the Japanese in the economy; the gross
                    ineffectiveness of U.S. support programs for U.S. economic interests in
                    Indonesia. That was a key issue because we were just completely out-classed by
                    all of our competition in supporting U.S. firm in getting business in
                    Indonesia.</p>
                <p>Indonesia had began to grow fairly rapidly, as is so often the case, as an urban
                    than a rural society; that is not unusual in Asia. Jakarta was the dominant
                    force in Indonesia. As a result, a great deal of the development tended to
                    concentrate at the west end of Java— from Jakarta westward. The result was also
                    that the Suharto family particularly the wife of the president became known as
                    Madam Ten Percent . She was known to be in on all the best deals. There were
                    land transactions and a number of other activities which tended to reenforce
                    some of the equity and income problems. There was a tight bond between the
                    Suharto regime and the Chinese. There were tensions that were in differing
                    degrees evident throughout Asia with the Chinese tending to do much better than
                    the pre boomy or the boomy picture as they were called in Malaysia. The more
                    rural and more remote areas were a great problem. There were large sugar
                    plantations which were severely exploitive of labor. As our tour wore on -
                    toward the end of 1974 and getting in to 1975 - there were a lot of tensions
                    building up and we were very concerned that the political situation could blow
                    up.</p>
                <p>Japanese Prime Minister Kanoka visited Djakarta which gave rise to very rabid
                    anti Japanese riots. They were seen as such, but the riots were also interpreted
                    as having a very strong anti regime, anti Suharto cast. That shook the power
                    structure up somewhat. There was a real concern that the whole situation would
                    blow up, because the Indonesians are much like their volcanoes, they pent up
                    these pressures and then explode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indonesia going amok.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Amok, exactly. That was one aspect of what was going on. One thing
                    that I neglected to point out earlier was that on the international scene there
                    were some things happening that were very important to what was going on in
                    Indonesia. As I have mentioned earlier I had developed in the Office of Monetary
                    Affairs a very strong interest in U.S. foreign direct investment policy. I
                    followed that up at Brookings and then I witnessed the investment boom in
                    Indonesia where American businesses grew by five fold in their numbers and much
                    more in terms of their impact on the economy. That really steeped me in the
                    problems of foreign investment even while watching the struggle we were involved
                    in in competition with the Japanese for a role in the Indonesian economy. We
                    found that U.S. Export-Import Bank was a very reluctant dance partner. Usually
                    it would join the process only after somebody else had proposed outrageous terms
                    which had basically been already accepted. With all the rip-offs that were going
                    on in Indonesia, it got very difficult for Americans to do business, even if
                    they offered the best of deals. We discovered in the work I did with the Harvard
                    Advisory group that Siemens, the German company, had offered outrageous terms
                    for the big huge steel project. There were huge kick-backs involved in that
                    deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The Harvard group was very much inside. You know one of the
                    advantages of being an American was that it is easy to develop very close
                    working relationships with local academic groups. The Harvard group was there
                    advising the Indonesian government. I mentioned the tension and the conflict
                    between the bureaucrats and the Indonesian economic team that Suharto had
                    brought in from Berkeley and other American universities. Suharto didn't really
                    care about the costs of a project if it gave Indonesia international prestige.
                    There were these uneconomic deals that raised tremendous tension in the
                    governmenThe Ibnews and the Ha bee bees were building up huge debts and
                    undermining potentially the good work that the economists were doing. The
                    Harvard advisory team did a lot of sleuthing for the economists to find out what
                    was going on. After the financial crisis that I mentioned, they were about to
                    pull one little financial card out that would cause the whole house of cards to
                    collapse. The Harvard team went after these various deals with a vengeance,
                    especially the ones that General Sutohe had been involved in.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Sutohe was a general, a colleague of Suharto. He had been appointed head of the
                    oil monopoly of Pernanema. With the oil revenues he was able and with the
                    companies and the command he had in international trade and international
                    investment, he was able to suck up all kinds of money for big deals and all
                    kinds of special deals on the assumption that anything he agreed to would be
                    backed by the Indonesian government, which was a fair assumption until the
                    financial crisis and then the bluff was called. So, these tensions were very
                    strong and the Harvard advisory group found the siemens and other corrupt
                    practices that had gone on. Eventually, Ignew was kicked out and the government
                    got in to looking at some of the deals, where the money had gone and all these
                    good things. That was exciting. But, the upshot was that I became very
                    interested in the major defects of the EX-IM Bank program, the problems we had
                    with OPEC, the project insurance corporation and just our terrible inability to
                    really support American companies in a very competitive way, which was really
                    putting the Japanese in the catbird seat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you compare and contrast how we and the Japanese
                        operated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: By this time, the Japanese had began to develop a fairly large
                    assistance program. The Japanese didn't have an AID mission, so they would ask
                    the government what kind of projects they wanted financed and the Japanese
                    companies were there to be sure that the Indonesian government understood what
                    kinds of projects they needed most. There was a very tight and growing
                    relationship between the Japanese assistance program and the Japanese investors;
                    then the Japanese Export-Import Bank could come in and under cut all
                    competitors. Not only were the loan terms quite generous, but Japanese did not
                    flinch from making loans of amounts our EX-IM wouldn't touch, because they were
                    too great. The U.S. EX-IM insisted on sovereign risks, on government guarantees,
                    which the Japanese didn't care about. There were just lots of terms that made a
                    big difference. OPIC was okay, but it didn't cover the things that were most
                    valuable in Indonesia, which was the political risks in mining and in petroleum;
                    that is where probably 85 percent of American investment in Indonesia was
                    going.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you also find that you were inhibited by whaI have seen so often,
                    particularly in military aircraft, where we can't pick one and say, go with the
                    Grumman fighter as opposed to the Northrop fighter whereas the French would come
                    and say, go with the Desalt fighter and that was it. They could support that,
                    whereas we had to be even handed, even though we knew one fighter plane was
                    clearly better for that particular country.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: That was definitely one of the issues, but I wouldn't say it was the
                    dominant feature. I think the financing was really a more important factor.
                    American companies were beginning to work with European consortia on the theory
                    that if you couldn't beat them, join them.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>One other thing I wanted to be sure to mention as background, because it carries
                    on over in to subsequent career moves, was that we had the OPEC oil crisis which
                    took place in the early 1970s after the Israel war of 1973. That put Indonesia
                    in a favored position with the United States, because although it supported
                    OPEC, it didn't impose all of the restrictions that the Arab countries did;
                    Indonesian terms were somewhat more favorable to us. The oil crisis then gave
                    rise to the period where other commodity producers, mineral and tropical product
                    producers, saw the advantage of what the OPEC countries had put together. The
                    new economic policy of natural resource producers began to try to create little
                    mini cartels and create international agreements to control supply and prices.
                    That was important, because Indonesia was sitting not only on tremendous energy
                    resources, but on incredible untold wealth in minerals as well. The new policy
                    was really a big boost to the Indonesian economy. One could notice the
                    development in the process of one of the characteristic that haunts Indonesia to
                    this day. I have alluded to it previously; that they tend to be so nationalistic
                    and want to be sure that they are getting the best of deals that they often mis
                    the window of opportunity before they realize that they've imposed conditions
                    that were too tough. Ignew Su Toe developed a very innovative, flexible and very
                    effective contract with the oil companies which was unique at the time and set a
                    pattern for oil contracts around the world after that. The mining ministry was
                    not; it didn't show the necessary flexibility and therefore often didn't
                    conclude deals. There was the one huge deal out in Airongia that did go through,
                    but a lot of the others fell through and to this day minerals haven't really
                    done a lot.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have any feeling at this time, because it became very important just
                    in the last few months in the United States, that the Indonesians, particularly
                    the major financial interest there began to know how to operate within the
                    American system, not necessarily political contributions, but in other ways.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: They didn't have clue one at that point. I don't think it mattered
                    all that much, because what was really important to them were the AID programs
                    and the U.S. military assistance and those things were working reasonably well.
                    U.S. was generally leading those processes and was still the significant donor.
                    They didn't really have a whole lot of political problems they needed attention.
                    Even the Chinese at that time were not the big players as they are now, even on
                    a regional basis. I would say that the Indonesians were much more preoccupied
                    with making a fast buck in the neighborhood. The big transactions with the
                    Indonesian and Chinese at that time were more likely to be in Singapore and
                    nearby neighboring countries.</p>
                <p>Q: Were we excessively concerned about unrest might over-throw Suharto which
                    might precipitate a return to Sukarno in some form or other? Was that a theme
                    that no matter what we did, we always had to keep our eye on what might
                    happen?</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Suharto had been extremely effective at getting rid of any
                    meaningful opposition. The concern really was more of a throw back to the
                    immediate post-Dutch period when the 3,000 islands might just simply go their
                    separate way, creating a chaotic situation. The feeling was that the anger
                    against the Suharto family was such that there just that events might spin out
                    of control. The military, of course, was by far the most cohesive force, there
                    wasn't really much prospect that it would implode; it was much more likely that
                    Indonesia would wind up with another military regime, but probably not a Sukarno
                    type of regime. I've already alluded to the terribly socialist, terribly corrupt
                    mentality that made Indonesia such a difficult place. For example, the East
                    Timor problem had really come to a head during my time there and that was very
                    tragic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the East Timor problem at that time and
                        how iaffected what we were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The effect of the East Timor on what we were doing was very remote.
                    Timor is a far out of the way place. It was a part of Indonesia that just not
                    been developed; it was very neglected, very difficult to reach, very isolated.
                    When the Portuguese decided to pull out, it gave the Indonesian military a
                    golden opportunity annex it without benefit of a U.N.-supervised referendum. We
                    were put in a very difficult position, because practically no one recognized
                    Indonesia's annexation of Portuguese Timor; the blood bath was horrendous; it
                    was just really brutal. It opened a lot of eyes to the real nature of some of
                    the military leadership in Indonesia. It was more of an embarrassment; it didn't
                    have any direct impact on our efforts, but it was so difficult to be supporting
                    what was going on elsewhere in Indonesia when you had this kind of behavior
                    which was repeated in other parts of Indonesia, where different cultures
                    existed.</p>
                <p>Q: Did we try to ameliorate government actions in East Timor through our
                    assistance program?.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I'm not sure that we did. The situation was so horrific that AID
                    just didn't want to be associated with anything that Indonesia tried to do in
                    Timor. The issue was never settled. I mean, it was a constant state of warfare
                    all during the time I was there. What we were doing was putting pressure on the
                    Indonesians through canceling IMET, (the international military education
                    program) which was one of the best programs we had for Indonesia. We tried to
                    put the squeeze on them in terms of military supplies, rather than the AID
                    program, because we didn't really want to put the pressure on through the AID
                    program which might have undercut and discredited the technocrats That was the
                    very group in Indonesia that you wanted to support and encourage; so I think it
                    was a reasonably compartmentalized approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we think about doing something for West New Guinea—
                        IriaJava?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I think not. I was distressed by our policies. I felt we should take
                    much tougher position toward the Indonesians on Irian Java. There was a rebel
                    group that was border-crossers taking refugees in Papua New Guinea to keep them
                    away from the Indonesian authorities. The also were doing hit and runs across
                    the border and I felt that that was going to grow and become a more serious
                    problem. The problem didn't reach proportions that I was expecting. There were a
                    lot of American missionaries there working with the natives. I'm sure we tried
                    to encourage the Indonesians to be more humanitarian. We were heavily into the
                    basic human needs as the basic justification of AID program at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you left there when and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Mid 1975, I think. During my last year in Djakarta , we had a visit
                    from the president of the overseas private investment corporation (OPIC). As I
                    indicated this was the U.S. organization that provides basic political risk
                    insurance and some financing for American foreign investments. The president,
                    Marshall Mays and I had hit it off very well and I was doing good things for
                    them out in Indonesia. At the end of his visit, he invited me to come back and
                    take a position with OPIC as the vice president for development. I thought that
                    would be great, because as I have said before, this was a continuation of my
                    strong and abiding interest in foreign direct investment as a mechanism for
                    development and many other things. So, I was very excited about that. That was
                    one of many of my assignments that took place outside of the assignment process.
                    I probably had fewer assignments that came through the assignment process than I
                    did that outside the system. I came back to Washington and, I probably should
                    check the record, but I think I went directly to OPIC and that was very
                    exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1975 to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: 1975 to 1977. That was a good period. I mentioned earlier that there
                    was a Club of Rome which suggested that the world would be running short of
                    resources and which supported a new economic policy which in part was to
                    discourage a world forming cartels to control resources. OPIC for a variety of
                    reasons didn't provide political risk insurance for mining projects or for oil
                    projects; they were considered too politically risky. OPIC already had a
                    tradition of making more money off of its insurance than it lost on its bad
                    risks. In fact, it prided itself on never having to pay off any of its insurance
                    policies. It was turning money back to the U.S. government. Part of its
                    successes was that there were a lot of bad oil projects in tiny AID developing
                    countries for which OPIC hadn't provided political risk insurance.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>As vice president for development, I was responsible for a couple of different
                    things. The most active aspect for some time was to continue to assure the
                    United States Congress that OPIC was not contributing to the export of U.S. jobs
                    through the support of U.S. foreign direct investment. We haven't talked about
                    this before, but with the U.S. balance of payment deficit, there was a great and
                    growing concern that U.S. direct investment was moving jobs abroad to lower wage
                    economies thereby undermining the U.S. economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is still a major political issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It's still politically, but it has taken a different justification.
                    It is now reviewed by the labor movement for unfair labor practices and by
                    others for child labor and human rights. We don't hear quite so much today about
                    the job exports, but the concern is still there. One other function in the
                    development division was to develop new polices for OPIC. As a result of my
                    Indonesian experience, I was a firm and devout believer that U.S. direct foreign
                    investment far from being detrimental to the U.S. economic interests was the
                    most essential feature of our international involvements. Inevitably we saw case
                    after case after case that real export levels did not really improve until there
                    was an investment presence. What would happen is that a board of directors of a
                    company couldn't care less about exports to a particular country, because the
                    company didn't have any assets invested there. But, as soon as the board had
                    some assets invested in the country, it really started to really paying
                    attention. More often than not, maybe ten percent of the exports would be to
                    tied to that particular investment and 90 percent was all the other stuff that
                    that particular country imported, because it had discovered that by the U.S.
                    company's virtuous presence, there that there were always markets. I was an easy
                    touch for that role at OPIC, because, as I said, I was a true believer. I was
                    not completely undiscriminating. I could smell a bad deal from a good deal, but
                    in final analysis I felt our deals were very positive. The much more fun and
                    active aspect of this work was that I brought in a good intern or two. We worked
                    on developing a new program for OPIC and sold to the Congress the idea of
                    supporting OPIC political risk insurance for both mining and oil projects. So, I
                    was able to see during my three years a program that went from zero to full
                    fruition.</p>
                <p>Q: were you getting support from the outfits like from the extractive industries
                    in the United States. Were they strong supporters? Were they your allies?</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Interestingly, we didn't have to think or worry too much about that.
                    It was the right time in history for to do this, because with the OPEC crisis
                    and because of the new economic policies, there was a lot of national interest
                    wrapped up in developing alternative fuel sources. This meant that we approach
                    other countries, and by the same token, I think the political risk was somewhat
                    less, because it was really to their interest to play it straight and make
                    projects work and be sure that they could pick up some of the OPEC market share
                    or that of some other mineral resources. One of the ironies is that a when the
                    Republicans come in to office, the first thing they want to do on the
                    international side is get rid of the EX-IM Bank and OPIC, even though private
                    business is its main benefactors. If I recall correctly we were in quite a
                    struggle. There were questions about OPIC's survival, but happily we overcame
                    those. We had a good congressional relations operations. No doubt we had at the
                    Marshall Mays level we had support that he had mustered, but it wasn't at all
                    critical because we had the right logic and the right moment in history going
                    for us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I hope I'm not indulging a bias here, but Africa was always one of
                    the worst places to go, because their political structure and substructure was
                    so fragile and the depth of leadership was so precarious and so violable. One
                    just had to have severe doubts. One of the very first oil projects was done in
                    Cameron, which it was believed to be one of the sort of relatively few quite
                    places; it has not been in the news on any of the horror stories out of Africa.
                    That was probably a good bet. Central America was both, among the better and
                    among the worst prospects at the time; South America was still trying to emerge
                    from its military dictatorships.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. Some of the worst places again - Haiti, and Jamaica - raised a
                    lot of concerns about whether some out guaranties were at risk. So, there was a
                    lot of CYA going on.</p>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Asia was a risk; it was still in major developing mode. It had lots
                    of problems. There weren't any bargains evident which was one of the things that
                    made OPIC interesting, because one really did have to take a close look at what
                    was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're talking about taking a close look ,where did

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The project promoters were required to come in with a proposal which
                    required very elaborate accounting and explanation of the project. That was the
                    point of departure, but then we checked in with the State Department and AID and
                    anyone else around town who might have some insights as to whether the proposal
                    was for real or not. By and large, the history had shown the projects not to be
                    too bad. One of the great merits and demerits of American business abroad is
                    that the vast majority of it is done by the major corporations which were
                    increasingly falling into the hands of lawyers and accountants and people who
                    didn't like to do anything that was likely to create problems for the corporate
                    logo, which had this world wide image. So, by in large, one didn't find too many
                    highly questionable outfits that to deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about places like Iran at that time? Was that
                        considered good safe place to invest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The Middle East was so caught up in the politics of OPEC that few
                    investors were interested. Furthermore, most of these countries weren't eligible
                    for OPIC financing anyway, which made it easier, because their per capita were
                    just way beyond our limits. Sometimes I am confused between OPEC and OPIC
                    because they were so inter-twined at that time; you couldn't separate them. OPIC
                    is one of the very few organizations in government that draws about half of its
                    staff from the private sector for its personnel and half from the government. It
                    has a mixed government private board. It got the best of cross breeding. One of
                    the things was that within OPIC, there were people who came from outside; they
                    had come from Wall Street and other places and they knew business and knew the
                    insurance business. That meant that within the organization, you had a good
                    balance of personnel with wide experience.</p>
                <p>Q: You could pick up the phone and call someone who had returned to either the
                    private or the public sector. You had a very “good old boy” network.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The most painful part of leaving OPIC was that I knew I was going
                    from a part of the government that had class back to the poor Department of
                    State which had absolutely no class at all. I don't blame the State Department
                    for that; I blame the idiots in the Congress who cannot see that if you are
                    going to have a meaningful diplomatic presence, you have to be able to do things
                    with a style fit for a country that has some power. We certainly did not do that
                    in Indonesia. I was hugely out of pocket trying to support our representation
                    activities. Enough of those snide comments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left OPEC in 1977, and where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was very happy at OPIC and had no intention of pulling up stakes
                    when I got a call from an old friend from Vietnam days, one Richard Holbrook. He
                    had just been asked to become an assistant secretary in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was for Far Eastern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: For Far Eastern Affairs. I think he called me and I told him I would
                    have to think about; I didn't know whether I was serious when I told him I would
                    think about it because the job he offered me was exactly the job I was hoping to
                    get sometime down the road. Didn't think I was quite there yet. That was the
                    deputy assistant secretary for economic and commercial affairs in East Asia.
                    Dick called me and I told him I would really like to think about it, because I
                    was having such a great time; I thought OPIC was such a great organization and
                    we were doing such exciting things. We were opening new areas of business, etc.
                    So, he had Phil Habib, the undersecretary, call me. I thought that was pretty
                    amazing. Phil called to persuade me that I should come on board and take this
                    job and I don't think I hesitated very long and accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, this is the Holbrook team that came in with the
                        CarteAdministration? He'd been out and out of government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Right. He had been in the private sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he came back in 1977 with the Carter Administration.
                        When weryou in this East Asia job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: From then until sometime in 1980.</p>
                <p>Q: 1976 to 1980. Pretty much through the Carter period. What were your principal
                    responsibilities?</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The one really over-riding concern that the Department had at that
                    time was the American withdrawal from Vietnam. This was the kind of concern that
                    Dick brought in. I know a lot of it was Dick's emphasis, but certainly it was a
                    concern of the Carter administration broadly. Our withdrawal from Vietnam raised
                    great concern that the Asians would resort to an arms build-up to balance a
                    power vacuum created by the sense that the United States was really pulling out
                    of Asia and that we were tucking our tail between our legs and pulling out
                    across the board. There was a great hope in the Department that the
                    administration do everything possible to try to persuade Asians that this was
                    not the case and that we were a Pacific power which intended to remain as such.
                    Virtually everything we did was oriented through that main broad objective.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression of the Democratic Carter administration which had
                    taken over from the Republicans. There is usually an awful lot of fumbling
                    around in an effort to do things differently. I was in Korea at the time and we
                    were terribly concerned about promises that Carter had made about during the
                    campaign about withdrawing the 2nd division.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The one really serious and obvious misplay that thadministration
                    made was that was that decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounded like one of the facile things that you can say
                        in campaign even if you really don't know the territory fully.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It's the Clinton equivalent of coddling the Chinese. Clearly this
                    was, as I was saying earlier, the one really major blunder with which the bureau
                    had to deal with. Dick was very quick to do all he could to appeal the decision
                    and to try to get it reversed. Dick, incidentally had a very good system in the
                    bureau which harked back to his Vietnam days. He very quickly developed a little
                    brain trust, consisting of Mike Armacost who was in the Office for International
                    Affairs at the Defense Department, someone from Policy Planning and someone from
                    the NSC. Dick had a little coordinating— sort of sub cabinet— through which he
                    tried to build consensus so that all the agencies approached the White House
                    from the same vantage point on Asian issues. Although this issue was not
                    directly of concern to me, I know that Dick was very vocal in trying to get the
                    Carter campaign promise reversed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came in, was it immediately apparent from
                        Holbrook thathis was something that we really couldn't do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Absolutely, yes. There was no question Korea decision, if allowed to
                    stand, would have broader ramifications in terms of what the Japanese might do
                    in rearming and what Chinese reaction might be. Our withdrawal from Korea ran
                    completely counter to Holbrook's basic tenet which was to convince the Asians
                    that we intended to stay in the Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do? How did you approach what you were doing
                        and hodid you go about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I had been around the circuit with international monetary affairs; I
                    had worked with Treasury before; I had worked with the AID program; I had worked
                    with the Commerce Department. I had personal familiarity with most of the
                    economic agencies of the U.S. government. I had worked with the Federal Reserve
                    Board. I was concerned that the U.S. should develop a coherent, cohesive
                    approach to Asia at a time when we were under pressures to reduce foreign
                    affairs budgets - e.g. the AID program was being cut. We had to find the most
                    effective use of the diminishing resources which required closer than normal
                    coordination. The second problem was that as it became clearer that our primary
                    emphasis was to persuade the Asians that we intended to remain a Pacific power,
                    those of us who were sitting around the room figuring out how to do this when
                    clearly emperor had no clothes. We didn't have incremental amounts of aid that
                    we could give. In fact, we were having to cut our aid, both economic and
                    military, so that we didn't have the tools on the economic and commercial side
                    as I described in Indonesia. It just became extremely clear that we didn't
                    really have anything to go with. I organized a task force and called together
                    people from across the government. We used to have regular, as I recall, monthly
                    meetings—strategy meetings during which we would brain- storm how we could we
                    take all of the disparate programs in existence and put them into something that
                    began to look like a coherent program which would further signal that to remain
                    in Asia. I was particularly concerned with the difficulty we had in working with
                    the Treasury Department, because it had its own little agenda which very rarely
                    encompasses the trade implications of the policies they were following. Only
                    when Fred Bergsten came along, I think Treasury began to participate in a really
                    meaningful way. I tried to represent our interests as effectively as I could in
                    any interagency meetings. Eventually we evolved the concept of identifying all
                    of the Asian countries areas where we had pending problems or pending agreements
                    that had been languishing and not going anywhere. In addition we had a sort of a
                    two pronged approach. We first tried to identify all the programs that we had
                    and looked how we could make them more visible so that they would have a greater
                    impact. As I said earlier, the second thing was to pull together a list of all
                    of the activities that were going on which were on dead center. At that point we
                    begin to work with the White House and in particular with Bob Strauss who was
                    U.S. Trade Representative. We began to work and coordinate closely with Bob
                    Strauss. I had a unique and privileged position as a DAS, because it wasn't long
                    before Dick told the secretary and all of his colleagues in the government that
                    they did not need to contact him on economic and commercial affairs. He wanted
                    me to speak directly for him and to represent him directly, even in meetings
                    where he would normally was not going to be present. As a result I was able to
                    work very directly with the White House and Bob Strauss. Dicks's support and
                    confidence affected my staff because they in effect became White House staff
                    aides. We were literally staffing Bob Strauss at the USTR.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>The second thing that was really very, very fascinating was working with the
                    coordinating group. We developed an action agenda for the entire U.S.
                    government. At this time, the very first word processing units began to come in
                    and there was a little thing called a Viadeck The Viadeck was the first attempt
                    to use a computer; they developed some word processing software. It was a
                    computer, but essentially it was good for absolutely nothing but word
                    processing. I was able by type my own papers directly on to the Viadeck and make
                    the corrections, allowing me to get the paper out the door the same hour or at
                    least on the same day. I was able literally to take control of the interagency
                    process by just being on top of the paper work. Everybody else had to dictate
                    their papers which had to be typed by their secretaries, and then reviewed and
                    probably in most cases, retyped.</p>
                <p>Our work with Strauss eventually gave way to the idea that we should work with
                    the office of the vice president and put together a package of deals which vice
                    president would then offer to other countries during make a trip around the
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about Walter Mondale.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Right. The idea was for Mondale to go around the region visiting all
                    the countries, signing the agreements that had been pending, closing the deals
                    that had never been closed, and in the process, trying to make a visible
                    demonstration that the U.S. was very interested in Asia in general and each
                    country specifically. We also put some projects together that involved some
                    incremental aid, in part because ASEAN (the Association of South East Nations)
                    was just beginning to be active in areas other than trade. So, we worked with
                    USTR on various trade issues; we worked with the vice president's office in
                    organizing the trip to fit into the basic concept of what we were about to do.
                    That trip came off; it was very successful. I was privileged to go on the trip
                    and that was very exciting because we went even to New Zealand, which is one of
                    the countries that always complains about never being included. That was above
                    and beyond the call.</p>
                <p>Bob Strauss was the real eminence in economic affairs outside of the secretary of
                    Treasury. We were finishing the Kennedy trade at this point. Strauss remained in
                    government with tremendous power until the end of the round and then he
                    withdrew. At that point, through Dick, we reattached ourselves to the White
                    House through the summit coordinator who was Henry Owen. We sort of shifted our
                    staffing support function to Henry Owen. That made a lot of sense, because most
                    of the summit issues at that time were economic issues that revolved around the
                    Japanese problems. After the end of the trade negotiations, it was a natural
                    transition for us from USTR to the White House.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How engaged were Carter and Vice President Mondale on
                        Japanestrade issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Not very. There was no point or there wasn't much need for them to
                    be. Strauss had such clout in Congress that there was no need to get the
                    president and the vice president engaged; you needed to get the Congress on
                    board and Strauss carried all that water. He had no problem. He had to convince
                    the president that the terms of the deals he was cutting were viable and
                    reasonable, but he knew the Congress and he knew what was going to sell up
                    there. I am sure he had no problem persuading Carter or Mondale on the terms of
                    any deal that he might have been cutting.</p>
                <p>The Mondale trip had a real positive serious impact in persuading the Asians that
                    we were serious about the relationship them. This was during a period when we
                    were suffering from major government fiscal deficits and from major balance
                    payments deficits. Therefore, within six months of the trip, the agreements that
                    involved money, were undone by the combination of the Treasury Department and
                    the OMB. Fortunately the vice president himself had conveyed that some of the
                    agreements involved significant financial problems. I learned, much to my
                    regret, that the power of foreign policy resided by default in the Congress and
                    in the Treasury Department and in the Office of Management and Budget. That
                    meant that the Department needed extremely adroit and aggressive management if
                    it were going to have much influence in the process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: In all honesty, none of the deals were earth shaking. What we were
                    seeking to do was by the cumulative quantity to achieve a critical mass that got
                    people's attention. That warranted a vice presidential visit but I would be very
                    hard pressed to tell you now what any of those agreements were. I would have to
                    say in retrospect I don't think that any of them would rewrite history, even if
                    they had been fully implemented.</p>

                        problemwith Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was. I spent probably a third of my years on Japan. One of the
                    reasons that so much of our early work was with the U.S. Trade Representative
                    was because we were constantly involved in the U.S.-Japan trade relationship.
                    That was extremely interesting. I was the first deputy assistant secretary for
                    economic and commercial affairs that I know of who was not a Japan specialist.
                    That position had always gone to a Japan specialist which I was not. I made a
                    lot of trips to Japan. We had some very good people on the Japan desk. We had
                    some very good people in the embassy. : Alan Rombery and Nick Platt worked on
                    the desk at different times. They were really excellent. We were very much
                    involved with the negotiations in part becausHolbrook was so adept and so far
                    superior to almost anybody who was an assistant secretary was in his ability to
                    develop relationships on the Hill. There was a lot of activism on the Hill
                    including a lot of proposals that would have really done a lot of damage to the
                    U.S.- Japan relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Retaliatory actions? HEGINBOTHAM: Retaliatory and
                        unilateral.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Q: We're speaking at a time, for the record, that there was then and still is a
                    horrendous trade imbalance between the United States and Japan, which gets us
                    mad as hell.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. At that time, it seemed, very large; now it seems that the
                    deficit at that time was quite small as comparison as what it grew to be. We
                    were very obviously very concerned about that. After a few trips to Japan I
                    became very frustrated with the Japanese who seemed to have - and still do - an
                    incredible capacity for resisting changes that really would have had no
                    substantial impact on their economy. Then once they finally agreed, people were
                    so fed up that they haven't done it sooner that they get no credit for it. This
                    was a pattern that was so evident to us who worked on that trade relationship.
                    We worked on individual issues, with USTR in charge of most of the direct
                    negotiation. I was concerned that our ability to assess the balance of payments
                    aspect was not as good as it should be.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Let me just mention briefly the interagency political problem. Treasury had the
                    monopoly on determining the balance of payments and economic forecasting. I
                    would go to Japan and sit down with a whole variety of embassy people who would
                    help me to get together with a group of economic forecasters from the various
                    Japanese security houses and elsewhere. I became increasingly frustrated with
                    the quality of Treasury's balance of payments forecasting. I discovered that the
                    Central Intelligence Agency had a superb economic analysis unit which had its
                    own model in their main frame. We begin to work very closely with the CIA, which
                    was refreshing for them, because this outfit had never had this kind of direct
                    policy involvement. Part of our ability to reduce a lot of Treasury's influence
                    was by finding the modeling that CIA did which I felt, was vastly superior to
                    what Treasury was doing. That helped us to shape our policy and frankly, I took
                    a tough policy line toward the Japanese in this period. I had four reasons for
                    doing so; one, because I had seen how the Japanese behaved in Southeast Asia;
                    two, I had no vested career interest in Japan; three, I was very frustrated by
                    what I saw in Japanese behavior; and four, there I was concerned that if the
                    administration did not take an aggressive control of foreign policy then I was
                    sure that the Congress would run the American foreign policy. That is a lesson
                    that I am not sure the Clinton administration has yet learned. So, we were very
                    active; I was very active in briefing the key figures on the Hill on what our
                    objectives were and what we were doing; we closely coordinated with USTR.</p>
                <p>The Japanese have a wonderful tactic of sending unofficial emissaries of very
                    high levels- - people who have no official governmental status— who would go to
                    see the various the heads of various U.S. government departments and agencies.
                    They would look for the weak spots in the policy development process and they
                    would make their own head count as to where the different agencies will come out
                    on policy proposal. This was killing us, because the Japanese could then bypass
                    us or they would design their policy so as to appeal to the elements in the U.S.
                    government that would support them. Through the inter agency group that I
                    organized, we literally wrote a script that cabinet members would follow for any
                    Japanese visits, official or unofficial. We took care not to preclude a
                    department or agency from taking a position on issues which fell under their
                    jurisdiction. But, as far as the rest of the issues were concerned, everybody
                    read from the same script. This blew the Japanese tactics because they had never
                    encountered this kind of situation before and they couldn't penetrate it and
                    they couldn't figure out how to beat it.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Because of our close working relationship with the USTR and our concern that we
                    were getting nowhere with the Japanese on the individual negotiations, we
                    finally evolved a policy to press the Japanese at the highest levels which would
                    have required substantial pump-priming for the Japanese economy to build it up
                    their economy to increase their imports. A guy named Richard Rivers, who was the
                    deputy counsel for USTR, and I were tasked to go to Japan and deliver this new
                    policy approach. We actually met with the prime minister which was quite
                    extraordinary for a deputy assistant secretary I don't know how often that had
                    happened before. We met with the prime minister and we took a very tough line on
                    U.S. concerns and interests. But the Japanese defeated us, because Dick was very
                    concerned that there that we not breech what he referred to as the “fire wall”
                    between politics and economics. The Japanese, as is their want, did want us to
                    hold a press conference. The Japanese held the press conference and, as usual,
                    pulled out all the emotive stops and made it look like a tremendous crisis in
                    U.S. Japan relations. I got a telephone call at three o'clock in the morning
                    from Dick Holbrook and I know the conversation was bugged. He said that he
                    thought the situation had gotten too dicey. The secretary of the Treasury was
                    very upset and concerned about events and felt that he was being undermined in
                    his relationships. He would call his counterpart in Tokyo, which I thought was a
                    really serious defeat. I think it was very destructive to our credibility.</p>
                <p>Q: What was your impression during this period of the Japanese negotiating
                    techniques? Was it orchestrated, or was it a natural Japanese bureaucratic
                    response?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: First of all they had the tremendous advantage, because it is very
                    easy to negotiate if you don't want any change; all you have to do is sit tight.
                    Our ability to threaten them was greatly reduced since the Nixon shocks of
                    refusing to export soybeans and other things of that sort; he also introduced a
                    surtax on imports. Since that time, people were not disposed to make threats so
                    that we didn't have any really big sticks to wave and the Japanese were superb.
                    They wanted to engage in quiet diplomacy, but that was the last thing they did.
                    As soon as there had been a discussion or a negotiation they would d go out and
                    brief their press which would carry the story the next day with only the
                    Japanese side of the story. After my time, very wisely, the Department became
                    very aggressive at holding its own press conferences in Japan; I think the U.S.
                    government as a whole did more of this. We did have the clout of Bob Strauss who
                    had tremendous rapport with the Hill. We did better than we might have done in
                    light of the situation. I observed time after time the Japanese would extend the
                    barriers, like the Maginot line. We would negotiate the termination of one
                    barrier only to discover that there were five additional rows with the
                    equivalent effect right behind that one. It was just really a hopeless
                    situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I was toying with the possibility of selective retaliation, but I could never
                    find a legal basis. I was not a great maneuver on the Hill, so I was never
                    effective at ginning up legislation with people up there. As I was about to wind
                    up to go out and do something else, I was developed what later became the
                    structural impediments initiative. The idea was that since there was no way that
                    we were going to defeat these endless Maginot lines, the only way we were going
                    to have any impact on dismantling trade barriers was to really bring about
                    structural changes in both economies. I could see some potential for real
                    structural changes in U.S. economic policies and I felt that it was possible to
                    negotiate some really meaningful changes in Japan. I was also, to a limited
                    degree, a follower of the Fred Bergsten school which maintained that failing
                    anything else, a change the exchange rate might be sought. If the yen
                    appreciated, than that was the best prospect we had to demolish some of trade
                    barriers. That was not a very good deal for us. It did increase the cost of
                    Japanese exports to the U.S., but it never had much impact on Japanese imports.
                    The Japanese were able to underwrite their exports because of the tremendous
                    monopolistic profits that they were generating in the domestic market. Their
                    ability to defeat the exchange rate mechanism was very strong, but that was by
                    far the most effective means we had of getting a change in the balance of
                    payments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Carter policy of disengagement from Taiwan and
                        closerelations with the PRC engage you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: No. It was the offsprings of former American missionaries in China
                    who had joined the Foreign Service who were excited by this policy because they
                    saw that for the first time in their lives, there was a possibility of actually
                    returning to China. That was the level of excitement rather than in any sense
                    that this was going to be any great economic boon for us. The reform process in
                    the PRC did not really begin until 1978-79 when Mao Zedong started it with an
                    emphasis on agriculture which didn't seem to have a lot of immediacy for
                    American interest. So the Carter administration policies on Taiwan and the PRC
                    were more than the political.</p>

                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: No. There probably were the odd matters. I was interested in Korea
                    because of my own sort of unofficial portfolio on foreign investment. I was
                    persuaded that we had wonderful opportunities for joint ventures with the
                    Koreans - beating the Japanese at their own game. What I only have to come to
                    appreciate much more recently is how much the Koreans are so like the Japanese
                    in wanting to do everything themselves. that even when, although it looked like
                    there were really prospects for doing that, there really weren't. They're just

                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: There were two other very fascinating activities. We were very
                    activist group I must say, as I think back about it. The Association of
                    Southeast Asian Nations was becoming an increasingly important player in the
                    area and even beyond. It starting out to be basically an avenue to integrate the
                    region economically, but that was a non-starter. They begin to discover that by
                    coordinating policies and taking the united stands, they could have more
                    measurable impact relating on the outside world. So, they became quite important
                    in shaping the way the region went. I was persuaded, even more so than my boss,
                    that Asia was the future, but that we totally lacked the kind of institutional
                    relationships with the region that characterized our relationship with Europe.
                    While in the International Monetary Affairs Office, I had been to Europe
                    constantly—for an OECD meeting or a G-7 meeting or whatever. There were just
                    endless numbers of meetings. The cabinet and sub-cabinet contacts with Europe
                    were on a continuing basis. We were already reaching the point where our trade
                    with Asia was equivalent to our trade with Europe, yet we had none of these
                    institutional relationships. When you don't have meetings, the bureaucracy tends
                    not to do anything that relates to these area. I felt that a major part of our
                    inability to understand and relate effectively in Asia stemmed from this total
                    lack of regionally related institutions. It was a difficult issue because there
                    were still a lot of politics of the Cold War in the area. That tended to create
                    divisive forces that separated these countries from each other and put them in
                    to conflict with each other. On the other hand, there was an economic fear, with
                    every country was trying to get ahead of its neighbors by one means or another.
                    So there seemed to be a really good basis for trying gradually to achieve some
                    kind of regional institution.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We worked very closely with the academic community. That was another very nice
                    feature working for Dick who actively promoted and interacted with a wide
                    variety of academics throughout the entire period. That was very stimulating and
                    very useful, very productive. The academic community and the business community
                    had both developed various regional organizations and had proposed more
                    ambitious ones. It was my belief that we ought to try and take an active role in
                    trying to promote something like that. But, it was also painfully clear that any
                    initiative that was going to be taken by, worst of all Japan, second worst the
                    United States, and third worst Australia, would meet with immediate ASEAN
                    suspicion and rejection. The whole point of ASEAN was that Asians wanted to be
                    independent of the major powers. . They didn't want to be run according to
                    American or Japanese, particularly not Japanese, rules of the road. If ASEAN
                    thought of taking an action that both the Japanese and the Americans supported,
                    the idea was in deep trouble. Our challenge therefore was to craft something
                    that could be developed as an American initiative, but acceptable to the Asians.
                    It was my proposal that we should develop an organization that would be
                    simultaneously stimulate a series of research institutes in each of the
                    countries of the region with official participation, but not in official
                    capacity. I worked to identify some of these institutes. This was the area where
                    an interest already existed; so it was no great struggle to identify one
                    institute in each country which would be willing to undertake this kind of
                    initiative or would work together on this kind of an initiative. I then proposed
                    to take a trip to the region to talk to government officials to muster support
                    for our initiative. On this occasion I don't think Dick he mistrusted me, but he
                    also wanted a less biased voice to make sure that I wasn't going to sell him on
                    anything when I came back. He asked Don Zgoria to go with me on this trip. We
                    worked out an agenda that took us around through the region first and then ended
                    in Japan, because we had to try and persuade the Japanese of the extreme
                    delicacy of this effort so they wouldn't upset the apple cart by being either
                    too interested or too dis interested in it—either way. I had informal assurances
                    that both Taiwanese and the PRC would be willing to consider participating with
                    officials in an unofficial status if we got something like this started. We went
                    around and talked to officials in all of the ASEAN countries and then came back
                    to Japan and had what, I thought, was a very good meeting with the Japanese. I
                    thought that everything looked really good and I was prepared to go back home
                    and start the ball rolling by reporting that everything seems to be in place. I
                    could specify who the players were in each of the countries and could recommend
                    that we launch my proposal. The Australian were quite enthusiastic about the
                    idea. The next thing I knew, when I got back to the States, I picked up the
                    newspaper and discovered that Prime Minister Orita had taken the idea and had
                    proposed it as an Japanese initiative. That kissed the whole thing good-bye. It
                    went down like the Titanic at that point. It was just dead as a door nail,
                    because the Japanese did exactly the wrong thing and just killed it absolutely
                    dead. That I think, postponed the birth of the new organization by maybe a
                    couple or three years. That was an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you walk us through how something like that might
                        havworked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Sure. The idea was first of all to emphasize that the organization -
                    or the meetings (I've forgotten exactly what kind of terminology we used) - was
                    to be strictly discussion oriented with a focus on upcoming issues which would
                    important in the future and outside any current contentious policy issues. Under
                    the aegis of the research institutes, officials from all around the region would
                    meet in one place and one time, not representing their governments and with no
                    official capacity, at least at the outset. These meetings were simply designed
                    to permit contacts of Asians in the same field. Hopefully, they would begin to
                    develop a community of interest. Since they had the inputs from the research
                    institutes they had a reasonably objective and research base for the
                    discussions. Papers would be prepared by the research organizations so that
                    there would be a well prepared meeting. If a level of comfort could be reached,
                    given the delicacy of the relationships in the region at that time, the
                    organization should have good prospect of evolving by persuading people of the
                    value of this kind of get-togethers which would focus on forthcoming issues.
                    Without threatening any existing bureaucracy and having build a solid comfort
                    level, I hoped that over time the organization could become more ambitious and
                    therefore evolve into something more important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese trying to expand this in to something
                        more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: They were just trying to take credit for it. All the work had been
                    done. Ohira wanted to put his stamp on the region. Japanese prime ministers
                    don't last very long; this looked like a great chance for him to take an
                    initiative to make the Japanese leaders in Asia. I don't have any inside
                    information on exactly what it was.</p>
                <p>Q: It sound from what I hear that the Japanese are a sort of an unreliable group
                    to deal with. I know that one of the major concerns was that the Japanese they
                    leaked like hell. I have always heard that deals with them with a great deal of
                    caution because they have a hard time maintaining confidentiality.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Japanese are extremely difficult to deal with. The power of the
                    Japanese bureaucracy is enormous which until only recent times was unchallenged.
                    They are very used to dealing as a very close tight knit club with nationally
                    determined objectives. It seems that they don't really care much about what
                    tactics they have to use as long as they get what they are after. There are
                    sociologically factors at work as well, as best that I can understand. One is
                    that they convinced about Japanese uniqueness; they believe that no one can ever
                    understand Japan, because no one can ever really be the “Japanese” unless you
                    weren't born there. Therefore. It is extremely threatening to the Japanese when
                    a foreigner begins to speak Japanese fluently like a Japanese and apparently
                    begins to understand the subtleties of the Japanese culture. At that point , the
                    Japanese distance themselves as fast as they can if the person is in a capacity
                    that could be in any way threatening. For example, a scholar who shall remain
                    nameless for purpose of this transcript, who has a long history of working with
                    Japan. Recently he took a sabbatical in Japan to do research and he was during
                    an entire year so totally frustrated at getting any kind of meaningful
                    information from the Japanese that he came back absolutely livid with the
                    Japanese. He blows emotionally off the handle whenever you propose anything to
                    him regarding any kind of cooperation. It is a very self defeating kind of
                    mentality. It really creates great difficulties.</p>
                <p>Q: Obviously when you have to deal with the Japanese, you have to deal with the
                    Japanese and there's no one else to do it. But, in regional matters, I would
                    think there would be a tendency to bypass the Japanese or to use in the Japanese
                    as the scape goat or something. You say, if you don't deal with us you're going
                    to have to deal with the Japanese or we're trying, I mean in other words, pay
                    off the Japanese, because of this tendency. Did you ever find that
                    happening?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Issues come about in a somewhat different way. People frequently
                    have the experience of having Asians disbelieve that Americans can be so
                    uninterested in doing more business with Asia, because they would much rather do
                    business with the Americans than the Japanese, but the Japanese are the only
                    game in town. We are the only ones that Asians can work with because they have
                    flexible rules. That is the kind of thing you frequently find. I don't think
                    anybody actually threatened anybody with encouraging Japanese presence as an
                    alternative, but it's very unfortunate that the Japanese are unable to accept
                    their role in World War II. They cannot explicitly confess to what they did
                    during in the first part of the 20th Century; that has just created tremendous
                    distrust throughout the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find this that in dealing with Asians other than
                        thJapanese, that the role whicJapan playeWar II would come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It is a major issue for the Chinese. Back to what I said earlier,
                    the Asians would never trust any Japanese initiative in the region, because they
                    did not want the Japanese terms under which Asia would develop. Beyond that
                    perception was, and remains so to this day, that the Japanese are so effective
                    at promoting their own economic presence and their own economic interests that
                    they have made themselves the only real serious prospect for building business
                    relationships in the region. The Chinese are a competitor with the Japanese in
                    terms of volume of investments closed, but they don't bring along with them the
                    governmental influence, or assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were mentioning of institutional initiative. There was
                        onother thing that you were dealing with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. I was extremely concerned. As I have mentioned, the exchange
                    rate was the only thing that I saw as a very effective in allowing U.S. to
                    compete with the Japanese and indeed the Japanese yen did appreciate during this
                    period. In effect, the dollar depreciated against the other currencies of the
                    region to the point that we had about a 20 percent devaluation factor - the
                    valuation of the dollar versus a basket of other currencies in the region. But
                    after observing the impact of this and because of my trips around the region, I
                    was persuaded that it was going to take a lot more than a little devaluation to
                    make American business competitive in the region for the reasons that I have
                    already eluded to - e.g. that EX-IM was not competitive, that we had the foreign
                    corrupt practices act; we had two laws which taxed Americans on their earnings
                    abroad and Switzerland was the only other country in the world that did that.
                    Sections 806 and 807 forced the repatriation of a great many American
                    businessmen from Asia- people whom you did not want to lose if you were going to
                    be effective in business.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>One of the other things I did was to take a special initiative to develop a
                    closer working relationship with the American chambers around the region. I
                    urged and encouraged all economic officers to work closely with the American
                    chambers and I worked very closely with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
                    Washington. At one point we went out to a APCCC (the Asia Pacific Council of the
                    Chambers of Commerce) meeting; as a result of some discussions we had, I
                    suggested that we do a survey of all of the major trading companies in Asia and
                    find out what their view was of the competitiveness of American goods in the
                    region and what were the problems and what was needed to make American goods
                    competitive. From the end of the meeting at about 10 or 11 o'clock at night till
                    about three o'clock in the morning, I drafted up a questionnaire. I brought it
                    before the board the next morning and proposed that the economic and commercial
                    sections of the embassies and the chambers in each country conduct this survey
                    of the major trading companies in each country. They agreed and we did that; it
                    was a stunning survey. We compiled it and we put charts together, and then we
                    sat down in Washington with Oakley Johnson, the Asian guy at the American
                    Chamber. I told him what I thought we needed to do with this information. The
                    Commerce Department wasn't going to do anything about it; the Carter
                    Administration was not inclined to take any major initiatives on trade
                    promotion; the Treasury was sure as hell is not going to do anything with it;
                    USTR didn't have the mandate. That left the question of what we would do next.
                    The Hill was the only place to go with it. But where do we go on the Hill? There
                    were to Commerce committees that could be approached. We finally decided that
                    Lloyd Bentsen as Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee was the place to
                    go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Senator from Texas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: The Senator from Texas— erstwhile vice presidential candidate. We
                    made an appointment to go see Senator Bentsen and we took along our charts. It
                    was a massive study. There was just a tremendous amount of data that we had
                    collected. We had compiled it and summarized it. We made a presentation to
                    Bentsen and at the end of the presentation we recommended that the Joint
                    Economic Committee undertake a survey mission to Asia to do their own first hand
                    assessment of the results of our study to see if we were on target or not. I was
                    told by a staff aide when we left his office that Bentsen would never do this,
                    because he had never made a trip abroad in his capacity as Senator, because he
                    never wanted to be vulnerable to accuse accusations of a “boon-doggle.” I got
                    back to the office about a half an hour later and the same staff aide called and
                    said: “the Senator wants to make a trip. Please set it up.” The reason
                    apparently that made him decide to go was that he had been approached by both
                    the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the State Department. That gave him cover both
                    of the U.S. government and of the business community. The business community was
                    urging him to do this. So, this was no problem. We organized the trip. There
                    were going to be four stops and we proposed certain places to visit that we
                    thought would be useful. But, the Senator came back with his own list. We did
                    not have Taiwan on our list, because American officials didn't go there. Bentsen
                    had put Taiwan on the list. That made the Philippines the first stop; Hong Kong
                    was the second stop; Taiwan was the third stop; and Korea was the fourth stop. I
                    was invited to go along as the State Department escort officer and Oakley
                    Johnson went along for the Chamber. In fact, my wife was invited to go along,
                    which I thought was extra nice. We got one of the presidential jets. We had
                    several meetings with Bentsen before we went out. In one session he told me in
                    no uncertain terms that we will have no discussion of the foreign corrupt
                    practices act or of section 806, 807, I think those are the section numbers,
                    because “I've done all I'm going to do on these issueThey have passed through
                    thCongress and therefore are history as far as I'm concerned.” I said: “
                    Senator, we'll do our best to get that message across to the U.S. Chambers, but
                    these meetings are going to be organized by the Chambers; they are going to
                    include government officials, private sector people, etc. All we can do is
                    deliver your message and make it clearly understood that that's your wish.” He
                    said okay. We flew to Manilla only to find that the Singapore Chamber had flown
                    in a delegation who was going to make a presentation on one subject and the
                    Philippine Chamber was going to make presentation on another subject. As it
                    turned out, the Singapore Chamber was the chamber in the region that had been
                    most hit by Sections 806 and 807, because that was where all of the executives
                    were located who were paying taxes to Uncle Sam for their earnings off-shore.
                    The Philippines were most concerned with the foreign corrupt practices act,
                    because they worked in the most corrupt country in the region and the
                    legislation would have very serious consequences for them. So, as our misfortune
                    would have it, these two delegations made very presentations on foreign corrupt
                    practices and Sectio806 and 807. Of course, as the presentations continued,
                    Oakley and I were progressively shrinking toward the back of the room looking
                    for the door.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The other thing that was so compelling was that, not only in the Philippines, but
                    in subsequent stops as well it was the foreign government officials and foreign
                    businessmen, not the Americans, who made the strongest presentation. They said
                    that they didn't understand why we imposed restrictions which made it so
                    difficult to do business with American companies.</p>
                <p>We didn't know what was going to come of this Philippine episode. We didn't get
                    any immediate repercussion from Bentsen and Oakley and I prepared a good speech
                    him for the U.S. Chamber in Hong Kong, which is by far the biggest chamber in
                    the region. He got up on the podium and rather ostentatiously picked his script
                    up off the podium, threw it back over his shoulder, off the podium and said: “
                    I'm going to talk to you today about two things: foreign corrupt practices act
                    and sections 806 and 807.” That absolutely blew my mind. Not only did Bentsen
                    address the issue, but he went into a detailed 15 minute exposition of exactly
                    what he was going to do about Sections 806 and 807 when he got home. And, indeed
                    he did. He followed up on it when he got back. So, we didn't feel quite so badly
                    and the chambers obviously felt very good about it. It was a very interesting
                    and a very rewarding trip. To put it in to context, we as Departmental
                    representatives took absolutely no position on any of the issues; I knew what
                    stance the Department would take on the issues which would not have been very
                    helpful. So, the trip decidedly severed our purposes. It was exactly the outcome
                    that I had hoped for. We thought that if the Senator and his staff heard these
                    stories time after time after time from different governments and different
                    private businessmen, they might understand the problems that the legislation
                    presented. If we had presented those views as representatives of the government
                    it might have been seen as gross insubordination. The trip allowed us to bypass
                    every agency of the U.S. government and to go right to the Hill to lobby for
                    changes in the legislation, but without actually doing it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Holbrook did not get in your way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: No, not at all. Obviously he knew everything I was doing, but I
                    don't remember that we even had a very serious discussion about it. In effect,
                    he was up on the Hill making his case all the time anyway. The trip was
                    definitely one of the highlights of my career.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1982, you became the Director General of the Foreign Commercial Service.
                    How did this come about and could you talk about the state of the Foreign
                    Commercial Service at that point?</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It all came about in a most ironic way. While I was in the East Asia
                    Bureau as DAS, the Department fought, as it had for many years, against having
                    the commercial function taken away from it and given to the Commerce Department.
                    Someone at senior levels decided that commerce was not really a foreign policy
                    function and that the Department should exercise the better part of valor and
                    give the commercial function up to the Commerce Department. I couldn't believe
                    it. I tried from my middle management level position to exert whatever counter
                    influence I could to try and persuade the powers-to-be that this decision was a
                    terribly foolish mistake from the Department's point of view, because that meant
                    that roughly half of the positions in the economic cone which constituted an
                    opportunity for Foreign Service officers, would be lost. I was never in my early
                    years a great fan of the commercial function, because I found myself doing some
                    awfully useless stuff and, as I mentioned earlier, found myself going to
                    countries where American business was far more knowledgeable about the local
                    situation than I or the embassy. The question was always how we help American
                    business. As I said, I was no great lover of the commercial function, but I also
                    thought at the same time that the commercial function gave great insight into
                    what was going on in the country and provided embassy officer with good
                    connections as well as an opportunity to work with American business. All those
                    advantages were a plus for the commercial service and the embassy as a whole. At
                    that time, it was a great preoccupation of the United States to overcome our
                    balance of payments deficit, so that trade and investment really had a rather
                    high national priority. For the Department to agree to the transfer of the
                    function, I thought, was the death knell of the economic function and of the
                    Department's ability to influence economic policy, because we wouldn't have the
                    breath of officers and the needed interest. I thought that this would also cause
                    a diminishing of the importance and effectiveness of the economic function,
                    because in quite a number of posts they the commercial and economic functions
                    were inseparable. They were integrated and you couldn't do one without doing the
                    other. Furthermore, one couldn't understand the economy of the country without
                    knowing what was going on on the commercial side. So, I was just vigorously
                    opposed to transferring the commercial function to the Commerce Department. In
                    retrospect that I must have been one of the leading, if not the leading,
                    opponent of giving up that function. But the die was cast and there was no
                    recourse.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever identify where the decision was made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I don't remember that there were any memoranda oopportunities to
                    really address the issue.</p>
                <p>Q: I think it was around this same time that a proposal was put forward to take
                    the visa function away from the Department of State and hand it over to the
                    Immigration Service . Somebody was trying to give away a store about that time.
                    The proposal finally died.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Interesting I can only assume that the decision would come from the
                    secretary's level, because it was such a crucial decision in regard to the
                    Service. The Director General of the Foreign Service at that time was Harry
                    Barnes. As soon as the die was cast, he started trying to persuade me to take
                    the job. I told him that I thought this is insane. I was the most vocal opponent
                    of the move, so I just had absolutely no interest in aiding and abetting that
                    process. But Harry kept after me for quite a few months. I honestly cannot
                    reconstruct what stroke of madness came over me and at some point I finally
                    decided that perhapI can do something useful in trying to make the best of a bad
                    thing. It was a decision that I deeply regret to this day. It was a very stupid
                    decision for me to agree to do it. Anyway I did and became the State candidate
                    in competition with a Commerce Department candidate. Bob Hersefelt was the Under
                    Secretary of Commerce at that time. Malcolm Baldridge was the secretary.</p>
                <p>It was not at all clear that the State's candidate would win; I don't know what
                    the selection politics of that was, but next thing I knew I had been selected
                    for the job and I was greeted all around the building with congratulations. The
                    message that I was getting was that nobody in State thought it was a job that
                    could be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about over at the Department of Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I was not obviously completely trusted. That was one of reasons for
                    a very unpleasant transition, but there were others as well. First of all,
                    anyone going over from the State Department was bound to be considered as a mole
                    and an enemy by the Commerce Department folks. From the State Department's
                    viewpoint I have no idea what the sentiment was, but probably many people
                    considered that I was a traitor; later they had reason to have that belief
                    reinforced. But, I had the misguided notion that there was some possibility that
                    it was better to have a relatively closely integrated commercial structure than
                    to have one that was really at odds with those who really did not clearly have
                    the interest of the integrated Foreign Service in mind. The Foreign Service of
                    the Commerce Department was set up with the same authorities as the regular U.S.
                    Foreign Service. So, we had all of the personnel and other desiderata that would
                    go in to running a personnel structure and tours overseas and the whole bit. A
                    super structure which was largely alien to the Commerce Department was grafted
                    on to that.</p>
                <p>Q: The Commerce Department has and continues to have a reputation of being the
                    most political of all of the departments. It also has the reputation of what are
                    you going to do with good old George who's the friend of Congressman so and so
                    and its the place where you bury people. I mean that's the reputation that it
                    has. And, this is not a Foreign Service perspective, but this is a Washington
                    perspective.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I think that I would have said that that perception of Commerce as
                    the most political department in Washington is badly off base, because I've
                    found nothing there remotely to match the Labor Department in its internal
                    politics.</p>
                <p>Q: When I was saying political, I was really thinking for political appointees.
                    The Labor Department probably has real issues. I'm just thinking of a dumping
                    ground for the patronage.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: At the time I moved to the Commerce Department, the International
                    Trade Administration had had reputedly 13 re-organizations in the past 12 years.
                    The average life of an assistant secretary—I guess at that point they were
                    DAS's—, was less than one year. They were all political appointees. The
                    Administration was notorious. The mentality and the motivational environment
                    couldn't have been more opposite than that found in State, because people there
                    tended to create sinecures and empires and fiefdoms and build their walls as
                    high around them as they could in attempt to capture as many other little
                    fiefdoms as they could and then reorganize. The deputy assistant secretaries who
                    came in felt it was their task to reorganize in order to leave some evidence of
                    their stewardship. That was self defeating, because their reorganization was
                    immediately reorganized. It was a very bizarre environment. In the State
                    Department you made your reputation by what you got done in a period of time; it
                    was a “can do” attitude.</p>
                <p>There was the little problem of what is the Commerce Department was going to do
                    with its new responsibilities. The Congress had decreed that there should be a
                    certain pool of funds to finance the new Foreign Commercial Service; the
                    Commerce Department agreed to allocate those funds to the Foreign Commercial
                    Service, but the Office of Management and Budget decreed that the Commerce
                    Department was welcome to allocate funds for the Foreign Commercial Service, but
                    that it would have find them in existing Commerce Department budget There were
                    no supplemental funds to be obtained through OMB. This immediately pitted the
                    new Foreign Commercial Service against other Commerce programs; the closer the
                    function was to the work of the Foreign Commercial Service the more vulnerable
                    it was to having funds taken away. Since there was no existing staff, Commerce
                    chose an office which had no discernable reasonable function and took the
                    personnel from that office and created that staff of the Foreign Commercial
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, your best personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Obviously, the best possible set of personnel! Hand picked for the
                    function! This process was started before I reported for duty, I guess partly
                    because of my reluctance to accept the assignment which took up several months.
                    Commerce had chosen an acting director, a guy named Jack Golden who was an old
                    street fighter in the personnel business. I think he had been the director of
                    personnel somewhere and that was probably how he wound up taking that function
                    over. He was a mean, tough customer and came on with all of the charm and
                    appearance of wanting to be very collaborative and cooperative to “get this job
                    done.” I had above me two people I couldn't have been more pleased to work with.
                    I had Bob Hersteen who was the under secretary for International Trade
                    Administration who was very fine; and the deputy under secretary. He also was a
                    really nice guy. Both of them had come from the civil service. There was Herta
                    Sideman who recently died and she was one of the people I had to work for. She
                    was the deputy assistant secretary for trade development or something to that
                    effect. She was responsible for trade promotion. I came in to an environment
                    where somebody else had already been cooking the cake; I knew nothing about the
                    organization - i.e. the immediate staff - I did soon realize that everybody in
                    Commerce was an enemy because of the funding situation. I met regularly for
                    several hours each week with Bob Hersteen and he was very supportive and we got
                    a personnel system worked out. One of the key issues that was raised with me by
                    Harry Barnes was that with the transfer of the commercial function from the
                    State Department to the Commerce Department, there were going to be a surplus of
                    Foreign Service officers from the economic cone. I was urged to hire as many as
                    these now excess Foreign Service officers as I could. So, we concentrated
                    immediately on setting up an assessment process for hiring people for the
                    Foreign Commercial Service. This was a really killing proposition. I was to
                    invite applications from the State Department officers who wanted to take their
                    chances with Commerce; given the reputation of the Commerce Department, it took
                    a fairly courageous officer to be willing to throw his or her lot with an
                    organization like the Commerce Department. Nevertheless, the idea was that I
                    would try and hire as many of Foreign Service people as I could.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I told Barnes that I would take this job for only two years - no more, no less. I
                    absolutely did not want the job for any more than that. I wanted to do what I
                    could for two years to get the thing off to a good start. I was assured that
                    after those two years, I could come back to the State Department. I didn't have
                    to resign from the State Department, but I felt that it would not be a good
                    symbol or an evidence of good faith if I retained my State Department
                    appointment. Therefore, I chose to resign from the State Department's Foreign
                    Service while remaining a member of the broader Foreign Service and the director
                    general of the Foreign Commercial Service. That was done in part to encourage
                    other Foreign Service officers to believe that I had burned my bridges and
                    therefore could be trusted to do my best to look after them. But, by the same
                    token, I felt it would have been unethical and improper for me to give any
                    special preference to State's Foreign Service officers. So, we set up a
                    selection procedure, developed by a contractor which was very similar to that
                    used by the State Department at that time. They had gone into an assessment
                    center type of personnel selection process. We devised our own selection
                    criteria with the commercial function in mind obviously. This was a very much
                    tricker process than that of the State Department, because State Department was
                    hiring new recruits. I had to fill a lot of positions at the mid and senior
                    career level. This meant trying to go out and recruit people from the private
                    sector with substantial commercial experience, because it seemed highly unlikely
                    that I could fill every position from the Foreign Service, which had not done a
                    good job of motivating and energizing State Department officers to be good
                    commercial officers. There were some superb commercial officers, but that was
                    not typical of the Foreign Service. I felt that this selection process was a
                    very, very dicey thing. We were in effect offering private sector people the
                    glorious opportunity for an uncertain period and offering them at best half of
                    what they were currently earning. If you look at somebody who is going to apply
                    for a career change at mid-career, you have to wonder what the reason is; that
                    was even truer at senior levels. On the other hand, at senior level you could
                    find some people who had really reached the top and wanted to do something
                    different or maybe just wanted to have public service career. So, the senior
                    levels was less a concern for me than the mid-career. I always wondered what on
                    earth kind of people I was going to get.</p>
                <p>Q: Even in the State's Foreign Service I would think you would find people who
                    might feel their careers were in jeopardy and who might feel that maybe a
                    transfer to another department was a way to redeem oneself. I wouldn't think you
                    would be recruiting top drawer Foreign Service officers.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Maybe yes and maybe no. The other side of that argument was that you
                    had the evaluations of these officers by the Foreign Service personnel system,
                    whereas for with recruits from the outside the government you didn't have access
                    to that kind of evaluation. We were protected to some degree by the ability to
                    review the State files.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could look at the personnel files?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. That was the offset. I din' think we got the best but we did
                    get some people from the outside who stayed and proved to be quite good. We also
                    got a couple of real lemons. At the senior ranks we got some very good people.
                    We got a couple of excellent first rate people from the Commerce Department; so
                    it wasn't too bad. Just as a very crude guess, I would guess that we had at best
                    50 percent outside hires. I don't think we began to satisfy's Harry Barnes'
                    desires to take on all the FSOs who were interested because we were very tough.
                    We gave no advantage to Foreign Service personnel by virtue of their Foreign
                    Service status. The only advantage I can think of that they had a track record
                    through the Foreign Service personnel ratings and therefore you could make
                    decisions with a little more greater degree of confidence. You tended to weigh
                    the question marks perhaps a little more heavily, but we had panels that drew on
                    a variety of backgrounds; so I think it was a very fair and a relatively good
                    selection process working against very high odds. .</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Another problem was that being an Asian expert, I developed a certain bias that
                    the State Department had an undue number of commercial officers in Europe where
                    American business was fighting for market share against well established
                    competitors; this was not a new market unlike Asia fro example where we had
                    pathetically few commercial positions. I tried to do several things in personnel
                    terms from the outset. One of the first and most heinous Foreign Service
                    cardinal rules that I changed right away was to completely eliminate any
                    limitation on time in a single country. Time and country were not to be
                    considered as a personnel assignment factor. Performance was what mattered and I
                    didn't care if somebody stayed at the same post for 30 years, if they were doing
                    a top rate job. For example, I had in mind one particular officer named Herb
                    Cockran, who would have liked to stay in Japan. I never knew Herb before this
                    process began, but it just seemed to make good sense to capitalize on Herb and
                    George Mu and some others of the really first rate people we had in Japan. The
                    disadvantages of not having historic perspective were just so monumental. Japan
                    was the obvious place for longer tours and so I made it clear right up front
                    that if an officer desired and was doing a good job, he could have an entire
                    career in an individual country if he so chose. Herb after awhile got tired and
                    wanted to go to Southeast Asia; that was no problem.I also wanted to reel in
                    positions very quickly and get as many shifted out of Europe and into Asia where
                    I thought the U.S. government could be of the most value in helping American
                    investors and traders. I don't think there was any great disagreement with
                    moving personnel from Europe. But, it was difficult to do because we encountered
                    resistance from in the receiving embassies. As the State Department narrowed its
                    concept to what its foreign policy responsibilities were, other agencies
                    broadened their concept of their domestic policy realm by including some
                    overseas functions, leaving more and more of the State Department to be an
                    administration agent. State officers overseas became administrative officers in
                    support of other agency activitieAs a way to resist the growth of non-State
                    agencies, certain ambassadors just dug in and absolutely refused to accept any
                    new personnel positions for their embassies. Japan was a good case in point.
                    Every agency wanted to have people in Japan because it was central to Asia and
                    the living was quite comfortable. So, we ran into a lot of opposition when we
                    tried to beef up the commercial service in Japan. China was a somewhat different
                    situation, but in general we had difficulties increasing the commercial
                    representation in our embassies in Asia, where the U.S. government already had
                    large aid missions and large military assistance missions. That embassy
                    resistance to adding commercial officers was an ironic problem which made it
                    very difficult to match personnel with program needs.</p>
                <p>We set up a series of meetings of regional commercial officer meetings on an
                    annual basis. Among the benefits of such meetings was that they allowed me to
                    get around and get in touch with what was going on in the regions.</p>
                <p>Another serious problem was that we had only two positions at the level of
                    embassy ministers in the entire world despite the fact that we were the largest
                    and most important trading nation in the world. We had one in Japan if I'm not
                    mistaken and we had one in England or something like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Q: Are we talking about one rank down from minister counselor?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We had an economic minister in Japan and then there was counselor
                    for commercial affairs who was definitely subordinate to the economic minister.
                    Of all places in the world that made the least sense in Japan; at the same time
                    the State Department was going to die before it was going to give up a single
                    ministerial position to another agency. We finally had to go to the Congress and
                    at that point I was looked upon as a traitor by the State Department and the
                    Foreign Service. I was held in great contempt by those who felt that I was sold
                    out to the “enemy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People when they use your name will spit on the ground in
                        thcorner of the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I guess so. I had never had any direct insult, buI could readily
                    imagine what the scuttle-butt in the other building was. But that was a fight
                    that we had to fight; sometimes we had to fake it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say you went to Congress what do you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: We literally proposed an amendment to the Foreign Service Act to
                    establish, I think, five commercial minister positions in the world. That was
                    the only way that it was going to get done. I think that finally we got the
                    position in Tokyo. The new legislation was finally implemented after I left. It
                    took a while. The amount of time that was spent on personnel structure in hiring
                    and the assessment process was just horrific particularly at first.</p>
                <p>Q: You said you were well supported within Commerce by the upper echelons
                    interested in the international trade area. Did you get any feel for the rest of
                    Commerce? It has always had a bad reputation. I got that from the first day in
                    my A- 100 course when somebody from Commerce Department put us to sleep
                    lecturing us. That may be well unfair, but I was wondering if were getting vibes
                    from other parts of Commerce who might have viewed you and your people as a sort
                    of a elite corps within this rather third rate organization. I would think this
                    would not sit well.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes. The new assistant secretaries, such as Herta Sideman and Ray
                    Waldman, but particularly Herta, were very unhappy with this alien structure
                    that was grafted on and didn't really take. I am a very collaborative sort of
                    person, so I went to work right away to try to build up both the assignments
                    panels and the personnel panels that incorporated as many people from around the
                    Commerce Department. We had wonderful working relationships with some parts of
                    the Department, particularly at the DAS level and then there were some people
                    who viewed us with suspicion right from the very beginning. The greatest
                    problems, I think, were with the people who ran the domestic commercial
                    services, who viewed our status as a real down-grading of their function. There
                    was the problem with the domestic commercial services; there were 34 different
                    Commerce Department field offices around the United States with widely varying
                    reputations for quality - some below contempt and others considered excellent. I
                    thought that it didn't make sense for Foreign Service officers not knowing their
                    domestic constituency. At the same time, it didn't make sense to me that people
                    who were advising on how to do business abroad had never been abroad. It made
                    obvious sense to try over time to integrate these two services and put them both
                    under the Foreign Service Act. Eventually that was achieved, but it clearly was
                    not going to be possible to have that happen right away, because of the quality
                    differentials. A few of them, as I recall, applied for the Foreign Commercial
                    Service. We took a few of those people, but what to do with majority and with
                    the sensitivity of their leadership, which was particularly deeply entrenched,
                    was very difficult. I began to build the overseas structure with these regional
                    commercial meetings which I mentioned earlier. I did have good support during
                    the first year from Hersteen and some others. I had some really superb working
                    relationships, as I say, particularly the DAS and office level.</p>
                <p>I had a few vacancies in the office and I was able to bring in a couple Foreign
                    Service types who knew what it was like serving overseas. I can't reconstruct
                    exactly when this took place, but half way through my two years, Hersteen and
                    the deputy under secretary had moved on and Lionel Omar was selected as the
                    successor. I only was able to see Lionel Omar twice during that entire period.
                    He abolished the position of deputy under secretary, which I felt immediately
                    was a very dumb mistake, because the incumbent was very, very good and was doing
                    a lot of excellent work in keeping the various parts of the organization working
                    with each other constructively. I lost all recourse to anyone of higher status;
                    furthermore, very early in his tenure, I got the drift from Lionel that he
                    considered me the enemy and that he wanted nothing to do with me. As I said, I
                    was unable to get any appointments with him. Rather foolishly I had not
                    developed a Hill constituency. I played by the rules and had not tried to
                    develop Congressional support. I had been up to the Hill a number of times and
                    found that after they had transferred the commercial function they were not the
                    least bit interested in the fact that the Commerce Department did not have any
                    new resources to pay for this new function. I had not positioned myself, I had
                    not tried to develop a good Congressional base.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Before I joined Commerce, I went with Secretary Juanita Kreps on a trip to China.
                    She had been a business school professor. She was one of the few female who ever
                    became Commerce Department secretaries. We traveled together to China and met
                    with Deng Xiao Ping and did some of the earliest work with the Chinese on
                    getting business into a working relationship with the Chinese on their economic
                    reform efforts. Phil Klutznick was another member of the party. Once I joined
                    Commerce, I met with Baldridge. He was always very friendly, but didn't get
                    involved in the politics of our status.</p>
                <p>There are some other parts of the story that I should tell. My attempt to develop
                    a real serious business constituency - my attempt to develop Foreign
                    Agricultural Service type cooperator program with industry - did not meet my
                    expectations, in part because there were three efforts made to seize control of
                    the Foreign Commercial Service that were launched simultaneously against me from
                    three different part of the Commerce Department while I was on one of my
                    overseas trips. There also was a betrayal by one of my own Foreign Service
                    Officers. It got very ugly.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>Let me just briefly return to the question of relationships. I have already
                    mentioned the change in relationships once Bob Hearstfelt was replaced as under
                    secretary of Commerce for International Trade Administration and the position of
                    deputy under secretary was abolished. I had weekly, if not more often, with that
                    deputy. To this day I don't know who got to Lionel Omer, but probably someone
                    who was eager to seize control of the Foreign Commercial Service or who was
                    opposed to the way it was being run. Apparently, that someone persuaded Lionel
                    that there was no point in talking to me and that I should just be in effect
                    being frozen out. So I was thoroughly frozen out during that period. I was given
                    no opportunity to see Lionel. I was in the process of trying to select a deputy
                    and had had that process underway for quite some time and had selected a superb
                    officer with long experience. He really an excellent track record. It was very
                    important to me that that deputy position be filled by the most senior Foreign
                    Commercial Service officer, because there was little enough career progression
                    possibility in the system as it was. Lionel chose to overrule me and over my
                    protest brought in a political appointment from Texas— a young boy wonder who
                    had made a lot of money in Texas which is probably not that hard to do, but who
                    had no foreign experience to speak of. He was a brash, self confident guy with
                    just had absolutely no sensitivity for the issues that it took to run the
                    Foreign Commercial Services. His name was Ken George. It turned out, of course,
                    that he was the one who had access to Lionel Omar, which didn't make life any
                    easier for me. That was the problem. I had mentioned previously that once the
                    Congress had exercised its will and transferred the Foreign Commercial Service,
                    I was unable to find anyone on the Hill who really had a serious interest in the
                    Service or any sort abiding connections with it. So, I had no opening on the
                    Hill and certainly no one on the Hill ever expressed any interest to me about
                    the Foreign Commercial Service. I had multiple opportunities to testify before
                    Congressional committees, but they all had to do with specific. I took an active
                    lead in trying to get legislation passed for the establishment of a trading
                    company so that we had something more akin to the Japanese Trading companies to
                    work with instead of just a hodge-podge of American companies with no overseas
                    experience. As I said, I did testify. I can't begin to remember how many
                    different things I testified on, but never once did I have the opportunity to
                    testify on how the Foreign Commercial Service was running or whether it needed
                    support or assistance or whether it was doing alright. That was just not an
                    issue or interest.</p>
                <p>I was trying to build a constituency in other ways, but I was never able to find
                    any political constituency. I had mentioned that I am a participatory manager
                    and I had a very strong conviction that it was important for the troops to feel
                    part of this whole operation. So we developed a plan with contributions from the
                    field as to what our major priorities and plans should be. That was implemented
                    by a series of regional meetings with commercial officers which allowed me to
                    get around and see everybody; to find out what their problems were, and to see
                    how our general plans meshed with their specific needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>I had mentioned earlier that I had been given this sort of cast-off office with
                    no function that was to be my staff support. I had a number oForeign Service
                    officers who joined in. Mike McCurio came in, Dave Ross, and another fellow who
                    will remain nameless, who came in and they became part of my staff. I was able
                    to get a few positions to give me some staff support from people who knew about
                    the overseas side of things. The officer, whom I did not name, was a fairly
                    critical guy on the personnel side. While I was on one of my trips I got a call,
                    I think it was from David Ross, to tell me that three different organizations
                    were out to make sure that they got control of the Foreign Commercial Service so
                    that I would not have any reporting rights to the under secretary's office. I
                    think this all happened during Omar's tenure, because I don't think anyone
                    thought that they would get Hersteen to approve what they were proposing. The
                    weirdest part of this affair was that the Inspector General of the Commerce
                    Department decided that she wanted to put the Foreign Commercial Service under
                    her direct mandate and scrutiny. That was not a serious coup attempt, but it was
                    just so bizarre that that office which was to have a detached view and was
                    supposed to be entirely non-functional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think one of the attractions was the overseas
                        opportunities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Probably that. It was seen at the time as a sexy new thing. It was
                    the only new initiative had been assigned to the Commerce Department in many
                    years. In the case of the other two claimants, it was clearly control.</p>
                <p>I had mentioned that when I first moved over to the Commerce Department a lot of
                    the organizational work had already been done by a guy named Jack Golden who had
                    once been the director of personnel for the Commerce Department. I don't know
                    whether he fell from grace or why he was replaced, but in any event, he was the
                    principle one who was trying to seize control of the Foreign Commercial Service
                    and to have me thrown out. The nameless Foreign Service officer, whom I now hate
                    to a considerable extent, was a personal friend and a colleague, turned against
                    me and collaborated with Golden to accomplish the coup. I generally forgive and
                    forget, but that is one thing I have never been able to forgive, because it was
                    an institutional betrayal, as well as a personal betrayal.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The third person who tried to cease control of the Foreign Commercial Service is
                    now gone to her reward, Herta Sideman. She was the assistant secretary for Trade
                    Development. She had at least some sort of an institutional claim, but it would
                    have downgraded the status of the Foreign Commercial Service which was in effect
                    the co- equal of the assistant secretary, although I never had the rank; only my
                    successor got the rank. So, I had the title of director general, which in the
                    Commerce hierarchy didn't mean anything. It did mean something as long as Bob
                    Hersteen was there. It meant that I reported directly to the under secretary's
                    office. I did have access to the secretary on various occasions. Somehow we were
                    able to maintain control and reporting relationship. I really don't remember the
                    gory details, but needless to say, I truncated my trip and came back to
                    Washington to try and man the ramparts and find out what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one man the ramparts? What do you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: To be honest with you, I don't remember. We were really alone. I
                    mean State would not have helped. I didn't want to call on State; it would have
                    been fatal to call on State for support. I had tried to build good relationships
                    throughout the Commerce Department and I think I had succeeded reasonably well;
                    so it was it was a matter of getting in touch with people to ask for their
                    support. You know, in Herta's case, it was just a pretty blatant power grab and
                    I think I was able to do a line other assistant secretaries to oppose that.
                    People had been consulted; I was participatory, so I don't think anyone felt
                    that they were being left out if I continued in my battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the unnamed Foreign Service Officer? Did
                        he/shremain?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: He left the service. I didn't fire him at the time, but he did not
                    survive the Foreign Service. I think he maybe had one overseas assignment. We
                    got him out of there the best I can remember. We put him some place where he
                    could do less harm.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I did feel isolated with little interest and or support from most people. I tried
                    to build up constituencies and I worked with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce where
                    I had established very strong relationship when I was a deputy assistant
                    secretary of State. I mentioned previously that between the Chamber and
                    ourselves we had arranged this trip to Asia that Lloyd Bentsen and his
                    colleagues had taken; so my credibility with the Chamber was very high. We tried
                    to build on that relationship and with a number of businesses and develop an
                    interest group that would support the Foreign Commercial Service. We kept them
                    apprized of policy changes. But, in all honesty it was hard to find a group that
                    was really that interested in our problems. There was an interest; the most
                    interested business groups were not the organizations here in the United States,
                    they were the chambers abroad. We had very strong support from the chambers
                    abroad, but that didn't help me in Washington very much. Especially with the
                    Asian Pacific chapters of the Chamber of Commerce, to this day, you can go
                    around and find people who will talk about the Bentsen trip. That was just a
                    very big success from the Chamber's view point. It was the first time that a
                    Congressional committee had ever come out specifically to hear their view points
                    on their issues. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to capitalize on that
                    relationship to mount some business interest or sustain support even through the
                    Chamber. We tried other groups, but without much luck. Now somewhere along the
                    line I had long been very attracted to the tremendous success that the
                    Agriculture. Department has had with its cooperator system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I will be happy to explain that. The Foreign Agricultural Service
                    has a cooperator program. Basically what they do is to try to build a series of
                    industry or sector relationships in the agricultural sector that would support
                    and abet and cooperate with what they Service did overseas, whether it was in
                    marketing plans or in exhibits or exhibitions overseas, etc. That Service's
                    experience was very instructive; I found exact parallels in the industry
                    sectors. The Agriculture Service found initially that all of the farm groups to
                    which they wanted to relate were so domestically oriented and focused that it
                    was almost impossible to find anyone of like-mind who would be interested in
                    developing an international interest or expertise. So, they created a whole
                    series of associations which would have the international focus. They developed
                    a cooperator program, which had its own budget with matching contributions from
                    the Department and the cooperators. In some cases for example, they had a
                    check-off which meant that they did literally took a penny a bushel off of their
                    produce and contribute it to a cooperating program or something along those
                    lines. It was just, I felt, an extremely powerful and effective mechanism for
                    building constituencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was in it for the constituencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: They got in on the planning on programs which represent their
                    interest - the trade promotion aspect of it; the exhibits; the special programs
                    that might mean travel and exchanges. I extended even to determining research
                    budgets that would help in their marketing. Market research was a rather
                    important feature of the cooperator program. I found that the identical problem
                    pertained to trade associations in Washington which dealt with major exports;
                    they also were driven predominantly by domestic considerations. Rarely could you
                    find anybody who really had much of an international interest. What I then tried
                    to do was to get around to generate support for an industrial cooperator
                    legislation. I spent considerable time getting this legislation drawn up and
                    supported by Congress. We got it all the way up to committee before I went on to
                    other things; it was eventually passed in a somewhat muted form. But, in any
                    event I was trying very hard to work in that direction all the time I was at the
                    Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you find within the Department of Commerce some unease in developing other
                    organizations which might become supporters of the Foreign Commercial Service?
                    It seemed as if were trying to develop new power centers and this always gets
                    dicey.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It could have been, but in all honesty we didn't get to the point of
                    literally trying to organize these groups. What we needed first was the
                    legislation to enable us to do that and I found that even two years on the job
                    was not enough to get it passed. I felt then and feel to this day that for the
                    Commercial Service ever to develop a serious constituency requires that kind of
                    bit of a structure, because the existing trade associations, while some of them
                    appear to have an interest in trade, just don't really seem to able to muster
                    their energies in that direction. They're not a good constituency</p>
                <p>Q: This is always the problem. When push comes to shove the United States is such
                    a big market or they have such easy ties to Germany or England or something that
                    they don't really think about the rest of the world. There really isn't much
                    interest in further development, unless maybe they have a little extra surplus
                    or something.</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Yes, but actually they were driven to that latter point of view,
                    because since we had no effective programs of adequate size to support them, the
                    bigger businesses—the multi nationals— always had to look for export financing
                    or other resources by building consortia or allying strategically with Germans
                    or French or Brits or Canadians. Even the Australians provide programs much
                    better than ours.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find the Department of State as an institution in Washington and
                    its Foreign Service branches overseas worked with the Commercial Services? A
                    little bit dog in the manager?</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: It varied. I couldn't give an across-the-border assessment of that,
                    because it varied so widely from place to place. I think we had the greatest
                    problems in large posts where you had an economic minister or a minister
                    counselor for economic affairs. As I mentioned previously, we felt that
                    rationally we should have had equal status at the ministerial level in order to
                    be effective. Our foreign counterparts were all at the ministerial level and it
                    was ludicrous for us to try to promote trade when our people were one rank
                    below. We didn't have access to the more senior people in other governments. We
                    could not show that our commercial efforts had been given any higher priority.
                    That was a key problem of a systemic nature.</p>
                <p>Q: The State Department wasn't going to go to bat for you?</p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Quite the contrary. They were vehemently opposed. I think we
                    proposed four commercial minister positions: Tokyo, the U.K., and then I think
                    we wanted Bonn and probably Paris. That bureaucratic fight got pretty ugly.
                    There was no question of getting State's support for our proposals.</p>
                <p>For other posts, the principle variable was the ambassador. There was an effort
                    made when the Foreign Commercial Service was transferred to encourage
                    ambassadors to give greater attention to trade matters. This was going to be one
                    of the ways that the Department could show its support for the Foreign
                    Commercial Service without having to give us anything administratively or in
                    terms of the power structure. So, they did make an effort and I wouldn't be so
                    cynical as to say that that was the only reason for it. I think there was a
                    sincere effort by Harry Barnes and others to give real emphasis to the Foreign
                    Commercial Service and to commercial promotion. State still had to provide some
                    sort of credibility for the commercial function, because the agreement that
                    transferred the function to the Commerce Department, I think established
                    something like 35 posts around the world where positions were to be transferred
                    to the Foreign Commercial Service. But, in all of the smaller markets, the
                    commercial function was to be staffed by Foreign Service officers under the
                    jurisdiction of the State Department. These posts accounted for a relatively
                    trivial amount of trade and so it wasn't one of my pre-occupations with getting
                    the program up and running. This need to show some credibility meant that State
                    had to show pretty broad support. At the same time, there were ambitious
                    aggressive officers who weren't about to cede any power to the Commercial
                    Service and saw no connection between the economic and commercial functions. A
                    lot depended on how closely the two had worked together before. There were a lot
                    of variables. Some economic-commercial sections had already been integrated and
                    the staff was operating closely; in others they had always been kept separate.
                    There was usually a political factor in that. But, by and large, this was not
                    one of the major problems I had. There were a few places where we had to go to
                    bat for the Commercial Service, but I don't remember that as something we spent
                    a whole lot of time on. I think it worked out pretty well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that doesn't sound like the happiest of times after
                        having been bull-dogged in to the job. How long was it for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I told Harry I would take the job for no more than two years. Then,
                    as I mentioned I resigned from the State Department Foreign Service to achieve
                    some degree of credibility. I honestly understood that when I left the Commerce
                    job, I would be able to come back to State, but I don't know whether I was
                    brain-dead or whether I was burned out or what; by that time came, Harry had
                    been replaced by Joan Clark, whom I didn't know. I had avoided at great cost
                    building any sort of continuing liaison with State Department other than what
                    was necessary at the personnel level, because that word would have gotten out
                    quickly. So I had not only burned a bridge, but I had not really made efforts to
                    build others. For reasons that I still don't understand, I really didn't make
                    any effort to come back in to the State Department at that time when my two
                    years in Commerce were up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: I think at this point I was contacted by a friend and former
                    colleague of mine, Paul Boeker who was setting up a little organization known as
                    the International Reporting Information Systems, which was an off-shoot created
                    by Tony Stout of the National Bureau to provide political risks, advice and
                    assistance. The board of directors consisted of Robert McNamara and Harold
                    Macmillan and a very well known Japanese internationalist and several others
                    luminaries. So, I was the director for Asia and there were others, and we put
                    together quite a good, I thought, commercial support package for American
                    companies. But, unfortunately the organization didn't have a marketing skills or
                    experience It was having trouble defining itself for marketing purposes, even
                    though I don't think Asia had any problem defining itself. So, the organization
                    went on for about a year before it went bust.</p>
                <p>Q: Just for the record, you left the Commercial Service in 1982. Give us some

                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: When I came into the Service I had a very low lot opinion commercial
                    function; I didn't see any future in it; I didn't see any interest in it; it
                    seemed very pedestrian; not very interesting. By the twist and cruelties of
                    fate, my final governmental position was to try and make something of the
                    commercial function. By this time, from a rational view point, the United States
                    balance or payments problems had become major problems and so had the problem of
                    U.S. industrial competitiveness as well as the problems of making something of
                    our export program which had really become very important. I think I mentioned
                    earlier that while deputy assistant secretary, I found that the State Department
                    was essentially emasculated by the dual demon of budget deficits and balance of
                    payments deficits, which gave all power to the Office of Management and Budget
                    and the Treasury Debarment. Even the major accomplishments we had achieved were
                    undone by those organizations which said, “Well, sorry we don't have the
                    resources, don't have the money, can't agree to it after the fact.” So, my
                    punishment, if you will - the eventual movement to the Foreign Commercial
                    Service - was not without ironies, but also not without reason. Then, as I
                    started to mention, a friend of mine, Paul Boeker, invited me to join IRIS,
                    which seemed like a really interesting opportunity to do on the private sector
                    side what we had been doing on the commercial side. At this point, the challenge
                    of Japanese technology and the power- house system the Japanese had developed
                    for commercial competition seemed unbeatable. One of the things I tried to build
                    was an economic tracking service, whereby we would do competitor tracking for
                    American companies and learn everything we could about what these Japanese
                    companies were doing in technology and marketing and foreign investments and the
                    whole works. But, as I said, it really didn't fly. As I saiIRIS lasted about a
                    year and one day we were all called in and told to be out of our office by six
                    p.m. and that was it. We had less than eight hours warning that the company was
                    folding. There are all kinds of stories behind that, but the fact is that a
                    Foreign Service connection got me my first post-Foreign Service job, which was
                    very attractive; lots of perks, lots of nice arrangements. But, then all of a
                    sudden I was out on the street. Nobody had trained me for looking for a job. I
                    hadn't looked for a job since I passed the Foreign Service exam. So, I started
                    phoning around and I called one of the people that I had known at the Office of
                    Management and Budget him to see if there was anything interesting on the Hill
                    and he said sure and asked me to come up to see him. He was eager to hire me.
                    The following Monday I started working for the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee. . This was Ed Sanders who was by then the executive staff director
                    for the Foreign Relations Committee under Senator Percy. He was trying to build
                    the same kind of emphasis on economic and commercial interests in the Senate
                    that the House of Foreign Affairs Committee had. I had a great time working for
                    the committee. It was very fascinating. I was on the international economic
                    policy sub- committee and I worked on a number of matters. When I had been there
                    about a month when Ed walked in and said: “You know, I really hate to tell you
                    this, but I've just taken a job as president of a subsidiary of Harcourt Brace.
                    It is affiliated with Sears World Trade.” He bailed out along with Carl Lu Shee,
                    Tom Boyatt, and others, but he was much more successful and stayed on well after
                    the Sears World Trade fell. Anyway, I was excited about the Sears World Trade,
                    because it was the kind of activity that I had been lobbying for.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>IRIS and the Hill were fascinating; if I ever get financially set up, I would
                    dearly love to go back on the Hill. I loved the Hill, because it gave me a
                    chance to innovate; you could identify areas and if thSenators were at all
                    interested, they would encourage you to go on. As I said, I worked on several
                    matters; we held a lot of hearings on trade and trade promotion and investment
                    overseas. The Foreign Relations Committee didn't do a lot of initiating. But in
                    fact I wound up working for Senator Breaux who was on Government Operations
                    Committee; he was working a reorganization of the entire U.S. government
                    economic structure, which was great. I think we came up with excellent plans; in
                    my capacity as Senator Breaux' staffer I had a chance again to work with Malcolm
                    Baldridge. We interviewed him several times and I think came up with a very good
                    plan. Basically, Pete Peterson and the White House Council on International
                    Economic Policy was the right approach, but what we mandated was that the vice
                    president or the president had to chair the committee and that the secretary of
                    the treasury had to attend, because what killed Pete Peterson's efforts was that
                    the secretary of treasury didn't pay any attention to the Councils because he
                    had his own power base. He just killed the effectiveness of CIEP. So, that was
                    one of the key things we tried. So, that was fun, because it meant coming back
                    at the foreign affairs establishment in a way that I could be useful in trying
                    to reorganize it.</p>
                <p>Then I worked on the cooperator legislation and on an export the war chest, which
                    would have provided many more resources for export promotion. It was an
                    excellent way to follow up on my Foreign Commercial Service experience in trying
                    to get some of the things done which I knew were clearly needed when I was
                    trying to run the Service with no resources. Percy was defeated unexpectantly
                    and Matthias resigned and so on relatively short notice I was out on the street
                    again. At this point I did a little consulting on my own. We did a project on
                    the economics of defense cooperation with Asia. In the meantime I was invited to
                    apply for the job of Director for industries at the U.S. International Trade
                    Commission. Now that's not a sexy job with a lot of political stuff, but it
                    appealed a great deal to me, because I was fascinated with the issues of U.S.
                    industrial competitiveness. I would have had a professional staff of 120, so I
                    could find out everything I wanted to know about U.S. industrial competitiveness
                    and put out some good stuff. We cooperated with the Finance Committee of the
                    Senate to do a write a series of reports on U.S. industrial competitiveness.
                    From there I went then to IDA on a full time basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IDA?</hi>

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Institute for Defense Analysis. That is a federally funded research
                    and development institution that in effect is the think tank for the secretary
                    of defense. The Air Force had Rand, The Navy had the Office of Naval Analysis;
                    there are several other FFRDCs, but IDA was specifically to advise the
                    Secretary. We did some extremely interesting work in defense policy and in the
                    technology field. I won't go on into that, but any event, I was somehow able
                    with good luck and good fortune to move to a series of other issues that were
                    always of the highest intellectual interest to me at the moment. The interesting
                    thing was that I never did a job search during all of that time. It was just
                    using the telephone and getting a few leads. In one case, I was alerted by a
                    former intern who worked for me to a job and an opportunity; so you never know
                    where your job is going to come from. It always pays to be nice to interns as
                    far as I'm concerned. I think that the Foreign Service trains you to change jobs
                    and to change countries and to change environments. The other thing that it
                    taught me more than anything else was to develop an idea for a project and to
                    sell your project rather then trying to find a job. That is what I am doing now.
                    For example, as of this moment, I am working indirectly through to the vice
                    president's office on a project that would elevate U.S.-China agricultural
                    relations to the strategic center piece of the U.S.-China relationship. I am
                    working with former Ambassador Jim Lilley and others. Basically, this is all
                    evolved from a simple concept paper that I passed out and that we're now
                    beginning to raise funding for and institutionalizing it. So, as I said, I don't
                    look for a job, but try to come up with an attractive concept and peddle it.
                    That's how I got my job with the National Planning Association.</p>

                <p>HEGINBOTHAM: Great, terrific. The perfect example.</p>
