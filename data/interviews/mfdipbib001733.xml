                <p>[Note: This interview was not edited by Ambassador Rugh]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When, and where were you born and could you tell me a
                        little bit about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was born in 1936 in New York City. My father was a professor of zoology
                    at New York University and then at Columbia. My mother was a schoolteacher in
                    New York. I have a sister who became an educational counselor in Baltimore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, very much a professional family then. Where did you go
                        to early education, early schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I went to the Horace Mann School in New York City and graduated in 1954;
                    went to Oberlin College in Ohio, 1954 to 1958. Then I went to Germany for a year
                    on scholarship from the German government, studied at the University of Hamburg
                    1958, '59. Then I went to the Johns' Hopkins School of Advanced International
                    Studies, first to the Bologna Center '59 to '60, and then the second year of the
                    master's program in Washington, D.C. Where I did an MA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back to both Horace Mann and then Oberlin. Had
                        you gotten involved in foreign affairs or interested in that or when did
                        this bug bite you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: In 1950, when I was 14 I went to Europe for the summer with my parents. In
                    1956 I went to Europe on a summer program with the Experiment in International
                    Living, spent the summer in Austria in a German language program. In high school
                    I studied German for six years, French for four years. Was interested in
                    languages and I came at the interest in international relations through language
                    study primarily and decided that I wanted to get involved in a profession where
                    I could use the language as a toorather than as an academic study or as a
                    teacher of languagand that would be foreign affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, were people telling go to the Foreign; did you
                        know anybody in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>RUGH: No. My family was all teachers, educators. My father and uncles were all
                    university professors; my mother was a teacher and my sister was a teacher, they
                    were all in education and actually I thought I'd end up in education as well.
                    But I became interested in international relations and decided that I couldn't
                    really teach very well unless I experienced it firsthand. So I decided to try to
                    join the Foreign Service to have the experience of working in diplomacy and
                    living abroad in order later to teach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, by the time you got to Johns' Hopkins which was very
                        much oriented towards foreign service, not necessarily in the State
                        Department, but foreign service, you must have gotten quite a dose of what
                        the Foreign Service was about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: More or less. In fact I started taking the Foreign Service examination when
                    I was in college. I took it three times. Failed it the first two times. I passed
                    the written exam and failed the oral. So I was interested in the Foreign Service
                    and was trying to get in, but it took me three tries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is pretty much par for the course. Well when you
                        took the oral examination the first time could you describe where you feel
                        you did well, where you didn't, and all that because that captures the
                        spirit of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: OK. First time I took it I was an undergraduate and I had focused on
                    foreign affairs, foreign language study, comparative government, and not much on
                    American history or culture and I did poorly on the ladder. So I went back and
                    tried again but the second time I had been living in Germany and again I was
                    weak on the American culture side. Ended up joining the U.S. Information Agency
                    whose purpose is partly to explain American history and culture abroad. So I
                    finally made it, I had to study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I was an examiner for the Foreign Service and I
                        was an American history major, I used to sit there and glower at them that
                        didn't know their American history. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, I had to do some studying and prepare for it because I wasn't
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you get into the Foreign Service then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>RUGH: Well I finally, third time around, after passing the written examination
                    the third time, finally got through the orals. I knew enough about American
                    geography, and history, and culture to satisfy the examiners. And that was in
                    1964. By that time I had, while waiting to get into the Foreign Service, I had
                    gone through a master's degree program and gotten an M.A. from SAIS (Johns
                    Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies) and then entered a Ph.D.
                    program and I was well along on a Ph.D. program at Columbia University. I had
                    completed all my requirements for a doctorate and was in Germany doing the
                    research for the thesis when I took the oral exam for the third time and finally
                    passed it. So, I entered the Foreign Service in 1964 with an almost completed
                    Ph.D. which was the other track of my career preparation. I went into the
                    Foreign Service. I was sworn in in November 1964 with partially completed
                    research that I had done in Germany in the year 1963 64, a research year, but
                    without the degree. So I had to deal with that and I knew that a lot of people
                    had completed all but the dissertation. I didn't want to stop there; I wanted to
                    complete the dissertation because I thought eventually I'd be teaching and need
                    that Ph.D. So I kept at it and my first assignment in the Foreign Service was to
                    language school in Beirut. I was studying Arabic for a full year, couldn't do
                    much with my dissertation there. But on my second assignment was to Cairo where
                    I was a junior officer trainee in 1965 and there I worked on my dissertation
                    weekends. My professor at Columbia, Otto Kirchheimer, was a very tough task
                    master and he would tell me when I was home on leave or by letter, or by phone,
                    that the material that I had collected for my dissertation was interesting but
                    it wasn't a dissertation and I had to completely rework it. And rewrite it. So I
                    was rewriting in sitting in Cairo on my weekends trying to do a foreign service
                    job during the weekdays and sending pieces to him and he would send them back
                    and say this isn't good enough. That went on from '65 to late '66. Finally Prof.
                    Kirchheimer wrote me a letter saying you finally figured out how to write a
                    dissertation and it's OK, so we can go before the committee. So I planned to go
                    before the committee during home leave in early '67. Then I was notified by the
                    university that Professor Kirchheimer had just died. I was quite concerned,
                    having worked on this dissertation since '63, gathering material and here it was
                    late '66 and I was determined to finish it but my mentor, after giving me a hard
                    time had passed away. Fortunately I found a young professor at Columbia who had
                    been a prot�g�e of Kirchheimer and admired Kirchheimer. I sent him Kirchheimer's
                    last letter saying your dissertation is in finally good shape. He pretty much
                    accepted that and said OK, I won't revisit the whole story, I'll except
                    Kirchheimer's endorsement and you can sit for your orals, in February '67. So I
                    came back and to my great relief I was able to defend the dissertation
                    successfully and get done it and I got my degree in '67.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your dissertation? What was the focus of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RUGH: The dissertation was on a political aspects of the radio and television in
                    Germany. I had studied the West German Broadcasting system for the years between
                    1945 and 1963 which in the beginning of that period was under U.S. military
                    control. It was an interesting case because we decided that we had to prevent
                    German Broadcasting from becoming an instrument of Fascist propaganda and it had
                    to become a democratic instrument. That's not easy to organize and my question
                    was “How did it come out? Did it work? Was it democratic?” And so I studied that
                    and wrote a thesis on it. And it was related to my later work because I joined
                    the U.S. Information Agency, and worked in the media field. But I didn't go to
                    Germany. When I joined the Foreign Service they said where would you like to go?
                    And I said I'd like to go to Germany because I know something about it, and
                    speak the language. And they said pick another place, Germany's full. And
                    besides, you need a second language, you need a hard language. So I said well
                    I'll study Arabic because that's spoken in a lot of countries and I'll have an
                    opportunity to go to more than one country if I spend a year or two studying
                    Arabic. They sent me to Beirut in 1964 to the Foreign Service Institute Field
                    School where I studied Arabic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You studied Arabic from 64 to 1965. How did you find the
                        school at Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I thought it was a terrific school. I liked their approach because they
                    started with the spoken language and drills of spoken Arabic and only later
                    introduced, reading and writing. I thought that was a good approach particularly
                    because it's more suited to the needs of Foreign Service officers. This is a
                    controversial subject, some people say you should start with the written but I
                    happen to believe that this is a better way to do it. And my spoken Arabic is
                    far better than my reading and writing still to this day, but I don't regret
                    that. I think speaking is important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with you. Were the students at the language
                        school, was there much connection with the embassy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Not much, not much. We were pretty busy. We had our classes physically in
                    the embassy building in Beirut and we had a monthly meeting with the ambassador
                    who told us what was going on in the country and we had a few social connections
                    with embassy personnel, but it was pretty much an independent operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It was Armin Meyer. He then went on to Iran and later assignments. Armin
                    Meyer was a very formidable and respected personality. We were pleased to have
                    the chance to hear his briefing once a month when we did see him.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, I mean, here you were, you
                        really were a European, I mean that this is where you had been. And all of a
                        sudden you're plunked down in the middle of the Arab world here and all the
                        currents that are continuing to circulate in that place. What was your
                        impression of the Arab world when you got there, and Israel, and the whole
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Actually I selected the Arab world partly because of its proximity to
                    Europe and the European connections that are important in understanding the Arab
                    world. But when I got there I found it totally different. The differences were
                    more striking than the similarities to any place I'd ever been before. Beirut at
                    first glance looked like a rather chaotic, disorganized, dirty city. And it was
                    rather bewildering. I spent a year in Beirut and then I spent a year in Cairo. I
                    remember coming back to Beirut after a year in Cairo thinking, you know, they've
                    cleaned this place up, it's really organized and clean and I hadn't remembered
                    it like that. It's all relative. Cairo is dirtier and less organized and much
                    more crowded, so it's all your perspective. I had expected Beirut to be European
                    and it wasn't, and my expectations changed over the years. I was lucky in Beirut
                    because I happened to have an aunt and uncle living there. My aunt is the great
                    granddaughter of Daniel Bliss who founded AUB, the American University of Beirut
                    in the 1860s and her family had stayed in Beirut ever since. Her father was a
                    professor of medicine at AUB and she grew up there and came to the U.S. to go to
                    college and then went back to Beirut and was teaching there as an adult. My
                    uncle, my father's brother, showed up in Beirut in the '20s, met her, married
                    her and also stayed in Beirut. So, by the time I got there in 1964 he was one of
                    the deans at American University in Beirut, and she was there and they
                    introduced me to Lebanese society. She knew a lot of people, was very fond of
                    the country and its people and that kind of personal introduction was very
                    important in my appreciation and my wife's appreciation of Arab society. I
                    couldn't have gotten so quickly into Arab society without that assistance, plus
                    learning the language helped.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: 1958, when I graduated.</p>
                <p>

                        and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. She raised our three sons and then later she got her Ph.D. in social
                    anthropology, and became an expert on Arab society.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned getting into Arab society. I've only passed
                        through Beirut but from what I understand, Arab society was sort of
                        difficult to get into in Beirut because the Lebanese Christian community
                        would gobble up anybody connected to the embassy and it was a nice social
                        life and all that, but it was very hard to disentangle. Did you find that a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It's true to the extent that even the embassy had a very high proportion of
                    Christians and Armenians and people who were part of Lebanese society but
                    minorities in their own country. So the natural contacts are with minorities.
                    But partly through my aunt and uncle I was able to meet a broader spectrum of
                    Lebanese and Lebanese are very friendly and welcoming and open. In those days
                    there were good relations between the groups. Those were days of harmony among
                    the various Lebanese groups and it was later the situation deteriorated. So it
                    wasn't difficult, if you made an effort to get to know others. We didn't have a
                    lot of social activities, because I was busy studying Arabic but it was
                    possible. Of course later, by 1974 75, the social contract collapsed and the
                    society became very factious and it was much, much harder to get around. But in
                    the sixties, that was the golden era. I remember my aunt saying it was nice
                    earlier, but by the seventies people were looking back on the sixties as being a
                    golden era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what was the political situation there? There had
                        been the uprising, what ever you call it in '58, and that had seemed to
                        settle down. What was, as you saw it, the situation in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>RUGH: Well, Americans were very welcome. Relations with the United States were
                    excellent. That was what we believed at the time. Maybe it was a bit starry eyed
                    in the sense that we were talking to friendly factions and we weren't sensitive
                    enough to the discontent of Shiite groups and others who were becoming more and
                    more disaffected. But as far as we knew, Lebanon was a successful experiment in
                    pluralism. I remember very distinguished scholars such Malcolm Kerr writing that
                    Lebanon was a model for harmony among different social groups and we believed
                    that. It was a society that was very friendly to the United States. The 1958
                    crisis with the American intervention, direct military intervention, seemed to
                    have been a successful use of American military power to help stabilize the
                    situation. Of course we found out later that doesn't always work. But at that
                    time, in 1964, the American University, AUB, was a very positive factor. Later
                    it became faction ridden and had a lot of political difficulties. The American
                    University Hospital was considered the best in the Middle East. The American
                    official presence was considered benign and benevolent by most people. Of
                    course, in those years there was a wave of Arab nationalism led primarily by
                    Nasser, in Egypt, and to some extent people in Lebanon were reflecting that and
                    feeling that. The Palestinian teachers I had at the Foreign Service Institute
                    Field School certainly reflected that. They were by and large sympathetic with
                    Nasser and couldn't understand why Americans didn't appreciate Arab grievances,
                    about Israel primarily, and about American “neo imperialism.” I guess we tended
                    to blame that partly at least on Nasser as a demagogue, as an opportunistic
                    political leader who was trying to stir people up. We took it seriously of
                    course, but we also saw or heard a lot of people saying positive things about
                    the United States and assumed that there was at least a strong constituency that
                    was favorable to the United States. The Palestine question, the Arab Israel
                    question was the key issue of course. As students, as students in FSI in Beirut
                    in those days, we quickly became engaged in discussions with Arabs of all
                    political stripes about American support for Israel. That was a discussion that
                    I carried out from 1964, when I went to Beirut, until I left the Foreign
                    Service. But it changed. You know it changed considerably in the nineties. But
                    from '64 right through until the late 1980s it was topic number one in many
                    discussions, though not all. The further you got away from it, I mean if you
                    went to the Gulf or Yemen in any of those years it was less important. But if
                    you're sitting in Beirut or in Amman or certainly in Damascus or Cairo it was
                    topic number one. In 1964 when I first entered the Middle East and the Foreign
                    Service I got my first taste of it from Palestinians teachers; most of my
                    teachers were Palestinian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that's been leveled at the Foreign
                        Service, the Arabic core, is that it tends to be pro Arabic and hence, anti
                        Israel. So, in doing these interviews, anybody involved in that area, I
                        tried to catch one, you might say when you start out, your mind set towards
                        basically our support of Israel and then those about you and what were you
                        getting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: You mean from Arabs?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean really from within the group of people who
                        were studying with you and all. I mean this is an embryonic Arabist nucleus
                        (laughter).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, I guess, you know, we were new to this discussion. It was something
                    we hadn't really encountered in the United States very much where the discussion
                    tends to be more narrow. I guess all of us found this was a new and interesting
                    experience to be defending Israel. Part of our reaction was to say America isn't
                    Israel, why are you attacking us all the time for what Israel does? And their
                    response was, well, you made Israel what it is and you created the problem and
                    you're perpetuating the problem. We all felt a bit frustrated by that. And then
                    coming home, on home leave, we were equally frustrated by trying to explain to
                    our friends and relatives in America what we had heard in the Arab world. And
                    the gap in perceptions between Arabs and Americans was so big that we felt
                    caught in the middle. We didn't feel that we were biased in the sense that we
                    were taking one side against another. We felt more that we were trying to help
                    each side understand the other. Certainly we felt it was our job professionally
                    to explain the American attitudes to Arabs. Certainly in USIA and State and
                    other agencies of the U.S. government, you are supposed to explain not only
                    American policies but American attitudes. So we found ourselves trying to
                    explain public and Congressional and official attitudes of Americans towards
                    Israel and towards Palestine, Palestinians and toward Nasser and toward Arab
                    nationalism and all these things. But when you come back to the States on home
                    leave you find yourself trying to explain Nasser and Palestinians and Arab
                    nationalism to Americans. The task is equally difficult, if you begin to
                    understand some of the feelings out there. From that comes a perception, I
                    think, that people who spent time in the Arab world and become quote Arabists
                    unquote are biased - the portrait of the Arabists that Robert Kaplan has given
                    us in his book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is called The Arabists.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>RUGH: The Arabists. Most of us feel it is distorted and an unfair portrait and
                    it's a book that we have a lot of problems with. His pictures of individual
                    personalities are to some extent beautifully drawn but he's trying to draw
                    conclusions and he develops a thesis to tie it altogether which isn't accurate I
                    think. His portrayal of specific people he puts under the rubric of Arabist, but
                    his definition is flexible to include people who speak Arabic, and people who
                    don't, and people who know the area, and people who don't know it so well and so
                    on. So that's a problem in itself. His overall thesis for one thing implies that
                    Arabists have had an inordinate influence over U.S. foreign policy but we always
                    felt that we had too little influence over U.S. foreign policy and that the
                    basic decisions on the Middle East are made for domestic American political
                    reasons more than for foreign policy reasons. Some people in that book were
                    treated better than others, but he didn't really understand. If I can make just
                    one more comment on that book. He based that book on interviews with Arabists
                    and people who know them, not on an understanding of the Arab world. There's
                    almost nothing in that book about the Arab world per se. It's about people who
                    have dealt with the Arab world and he really doesn't understand the Arab world.
                    He's never spent time in it, more than a few days and has no real understanding
                    of that culture and people's attitudes there. It's very...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the feeling, that Kaplan I assume is Jewish, but
                        came out of the very much Israeli and American Jewish perception that if you
                        are not 100 percent with us, you are our enemy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Foreign Service has always had a difficult time,
                        because we're the ones who try to explain, you know there's not all only
                        another side, but we've got a problem to deal with and a complete
                        subservience to the Israeli position is not necessarily good for American
                        policy and it's the messenger who gets hit and I think Kaplan, one had the
                        feeling he went after the messenger. At the same time, he kind of fell in
                        love with the guy. Very peculiar. Very peculiar book. It started out with
                        one thesis and ended up with at sort of a fascination by these people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's not a very good book. But anyway....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>RUGH: I agree with your analysis. Some people have said to some of my Arabist
                    friends and have said to me, “you know it's not as bad as I expected.” I think
                    in the end he tried to understand Arabists and he seemed to be making an effort
                    and said, “Well some of them aren't bad”. But I guess his definition of not bad
                    means if you've served in Israel and understand both sides, then maybe you're
                    okay. He can't imagine that somebody who hasn't served in Israel has any
                    understanding or any semblance of objectivity. So he has selected a few Foreign
                    Service Officers who served both in Israel and the Arab world and said these
                    people are okay; and one or two others like Hume Horan who is an outstanding
                    Arabist, maybe our best linguist in the Foreign Service. Hume was involved in
                    helping to send the Falashas to Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the Ethiopian Jews.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. The Ethiopian Jews, when he was ambassador in Ethiopia. And Hume was
                    given high praise by Kaplan and one suspects it's because of that. He implies
                    that he's a good guy, he's okay, because he's helped liberate the Falashas.
                    Well, that really is not giving enough credit to people who haven't done
                    something for Israel. (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just put in the record here, for anyone who's interested
                        in this. We have a rather major collection, as the interviews of people who
                        have been Arabists and who have dealt with this. At least one Ph.D. has been
                        done on this by a young woman, Terr, she is at Clark University who is doing
                        her dissertation of the Arabists using what we have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, I hope it's better than Kaplan's book. It's too bad that he's written
                    the book that sort of defines the debates. He wrote an article first on the
                    subject and it was before he wrote the book and later expanded into a book. I
                    wrote him a letter and said you know you've picked out a few people who are good
                    Arabists, but you've missed several, several key people. And so he went and
                    talked to them and even with the book he missed a couple of absolutely key
                    people that I would have put at the top of the list, like Chris Ross. Chris Ross
                    is today hands down the best Arabic language speaker in the Foreign Service of
                    anybody except for a couple of native speakers who are translators at State.
                    Chris Ross is absolutely brilliant as a diplomat and as a person who has
                    mastered the language and he's not even mentioned in Kaplan's book. So there are
                    gaps. Chris is our ambassador in Damascus.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>RUGH: I went to Jerusalem. But Jerusalem was then in Jordanian hands. I didn't go
                    to Israel at that time. I went much later, when I was stationed in Washington.
                    Didn't have the chance to visit Israel, but I did visit other neighboring
                    countries: Jordan in particular, and Syria. We went by car, it was easy then.
                    After I had an assignment in Egypt following my language school I was assigned
                    to back to Washington and from Washington I visited Israel.</p>

                        any attempt to have somebody come and give you lectures on Israel today and
                        looking at Israel so you can understand Israel at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Not really. The Foreign Service Institute in those days at least
                    concentrated on language and we had very little other substance. We did some
                    reading, and we had a little library. But there wasn't much of anything other
                    than language; it's not like FSI in Washington. The field school in Beirut in
                    those days at least devoted almost all of its time to language study, and that
                    was it.</p>

                <p>RUGH: I did a year of language study in Beirut and then went to Cairo for JOT
                    (Junior Officer Trainee) training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Cairo from when?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was as an officer with the U.S. Information Agency, I was doing culture
                    and information work, rotating between various sections and it was a big Embassy
                    in those days. It had a huge USIS section including an information officer, an
                    assistant information officer, a cultural officer, and a couple of assistant
                    cultural officers, all Americans, an executive officer, a secretary, and a
                    branch post in Alexandria. So it was perhaps the largest USIS posts in the
                    Middle East. It was a wonderful training post because I worked with senior
                    Foreign Service officers who were experienced and quite talented and I was
                    simply rotated and watched what they did and did some sort of basic work for
                    them. Our PAO (Public Affairs Officer), Jim Halsema, was an outstanding
                    mentor.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of the USIA work, did anyone particularly strike you as
                        one really interested you, or you felt at the time seemed to be effective. I
                        mean, getting you out other than sort of the administrative side, I mean,
                        you know reaching out and doing what you're supposed to be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, I was encouraged by the PAO, Jim Halsema. Out of a USIS staff of
                    about 12 or 13 Americans, I was by far the most junior and yet when I went out
                    and began to do some analytical reporting on various aspects of Egyptian
                    society, he read them, commented, and gave me credit for doing that and
                    encouraged me to do more. So I felt pretty good about that. I thought it was the
                    most interesting part of the job; to get out and try to get into people's heads
                    and learn what people were thinking and doing. And if my boss, who was such a
                    senior officer, liked it, that's great. So I didn't focus too much on the in
                    house part of the job. I tried to get out as much as I could because he
                    encouraged me to do so and I was able to use the language that I'd learned. I
                    went to movies and talked to people and got to know people, although it was
                    somewhat difficult in those days to have a lot of social contact with Egyptians
                    because Nasser was in power. He was so clearly hostile to the US. He perceived
                    dangers of American imperialism so that Egyptians were afraid to have a lot of
                    contact with the United States and with American officials in particular. They
                    wouldn't come to the house for dinner or for any reason. I would have to meet
                    them elsewhere because they suspected that my house was being watched. I
                    remember on one occasion I invited a professor from the university to come to
                    dinner and he said, “Well, I can come if you don't invite anybody else because
                    I'm concerned that people will report on what I'm doing and my contact with
                    you.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Okay, it will just be you.” He came to the house and we had a nice
                    dinner, nice discussion. He was a very intelligent professor of political
                    science which is what I had studied. We had a lot to talk about and it was
                    interesting to hear his views on Egyptian society and foreign policy. When he
                    left I discovered that he didn't have a car parked in front of the house and I
                    said, “Where is your car?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well I parked it two blocks away because I didn't want the police,
                    the Mukhabarat, to see it.”</p>
                <p>And I thought that he was brave to come and see me in spite of these
                    restrictions. His name was Boutros Ghali. He was at that time head of the
                    political science department at the University and he had enough courage to be
                    in touch with Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's now the Secretary General of the United Nations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RUGH: Secretary General of the UN. But he had enough intellectual curiosity to
                    talk to an American diplomat and find out what we were thinking as well as to
                    tell us what he was thinking. So I have always respected him for a lot of
                    reasons. Later when I went back to Egypt on another assignment, I saw him
                    occasionally, but he was by then being elevated first to a senior position in
                    the Foreign Ministry and then some other assignments. So I didn't have a lot to
                    do with him later, but he's a formidable intellect and a very decent man. I
                    always remembered my first contacts with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your feelings and many maybe any reflection you
                        might have on sort of the embassy feeling towards Nasser at this time. This
                        is still just on the brink, a little before the '67 War which was such a
                        disaster to Egypt and to Nasser.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well I guess we all had mixed feelings. The people who had been around the
                    area for awhile, and been in Egypt for awhile, came to appreciate to some extent
                    the grievances that the Egyptians had over American support for Israel. But I
                    guess the overwhelming feeling was that America was being treated unfairly and
                    that not only were the attacks, the verbal attacks on Israel, and on the United
                    States for its support of Israel unjustified and exaggerated beyond all
                    proportion, but this spilled over into everything else. The United States had
                    been trying to help Egypt for years with economic assistance and support for
                    Egypt's independence and we got no appreciation for it from the regime. And we
                    felt that Nasser was leading the people off in a direction that exaggerated the
                    grievances and was exploiting them for his own purposes. There were differences
                    of opinion within the embassy staff. Our political counselor, Dick Parker, was
                    one of the great analysts of the Foreign Service in the Near East Bureau and he
                    had a very sober, sensible appreciation of the situation I thought. Luke Battle,
                    our ambassador, had superb judgment and was very balanced and certainly defended
                    and explained American policy as well as anybody could have in those days.
                    Unfortunately Battle left, was reassigned, I believe early in '67 or late in
                    '66, just when I was. And I left also in '66 to go on to another assignment and
                    I wasn't in Egypt when the June war broke out. There is a feeling in the Foreign
                    Service that if he had, as some of us feel, that if Battle had been present as
                    ambassador to Egypt in June 1967, he would have played a major role in trying to
                    avert a war. I can't say that he would have succeeded, but we didn't have an
                    ambassador in June 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The '67 War came about through basically miscalculations
                        on the part of Nasser, sort of a bluff that went awry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right, and so my point is exactly that, that Nasser misunderstood the
                    situation. The Israelis had their calculations and we didn't have a man of the
                    stature of Luke Battle there to help talk to Nasser; to help talk to Washington
                    and indirectly to the Israelis and to help calm the situation and avert a
                    disaster. I think Battle was such a formidable diplomat that he might have made
                    a difference had he been there, but he wasn't.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are just learning Arabic, which means you're full
                        of piss and vinegar in getting out and wanting to see things, you're young,
                        one of the most important and volatile groups in Arab society, particularly
                        in a place like Cairo, would be the University. Were you able to get to the
                        students, I mean mix and mingle with the students and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, to some extent. Directly at the universities, there are huge
                    universities. Cairo University, Ain Shams University, Alexandria University had
                    I guess in those days tens of thousands now hundreds of thousands of students;
                    AUC, the American University, had a few hundred and I was in touch with students
                    in all of those campuses. In addition there was a Strategic Studies Center at Al
                    Ahram which I was in touch with. It was not easy because of the hostility of
                    Nasser and the mood in the country being suspicious of Americans, but we did
                    succeed to some extent. We got out and we had friends. In particular I was
                    trying to reach some of the people in the media. The media was very hostile, a
                    lot of the writers were very vitriolic. And it was my job in USIS to try to work
                    with them. Some of them were reachable and some of them were very difficult to
                    talk to. I had another assignment in Egypt at a later period in my career and
                    some of the people who had been so hostile to us had been tamed by then because
                    it was a different era and a different political situation and Sadat was
                    friendly when Nasser had not been. These same people were in the press, but they
                    were now either muzzled or tamed in what they could say. They then were some of
                    my best contacts because I'd known them in an earlier period when they were able
                    to bash us and now they were not. So I saw them again and I reminded them that
                    they had really given us a hard time before and now the shoe was on the other
                    foot. They're still friends of mine. I still see them what I go to Cairo, so the
                    changing political context didn't change the people, but it changed what they
                    could say and that made it interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '64 to '66, how did we feel about the influence of the
                        Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Oh yes, that was a major issue for us. The competition with the Soviets was
                    very high on our agenda. We were very concerned about what the Soviets were
                    doing with the Egyptians. Supporting the Egyptians and others in the region, but
                    particularly Egypt. Egypt was sort of the primary case of competition with the
                    USSR.</p>
                <p>The Soviets were considered by us to be very dangerous. They were taking
                    advantage of discontents over American foreign policy, particularly with respect
                    to Israel which we knew were not only part of Nasser's position, but were
                    touching on real dissatisfaction in Egyptian and Arab society. The Soviet
                    influence in Egypt was in those days very substantial. Our official contact
                    between American diplomats and Soviet diplomats was strained and there were
                    efforts by Soviets, either officials or what we suspected to be officials under
                    cover.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: KGB or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: KGB types, to contact us. I remember a TASS representative who I suspected
                    was a KGB type invited me a couple of times to his apartment and fed me a lot of
                    vodka. I was very suspicious of his intentions. He seemed to know a lot about my
                    background and my biography. We were very wary of the Soviets and had very
                    little to do with them. We didn't seek them out and they didn't seek us out. We
                    suspected that they were very busy with the military and others in Egypt. But
                    Egyptians are quite open and aside from the fact that they feared their own
                    intelligence people, authority, they were interested in having contacts and they
                    liked to have discussions. Egyptians love to talk and love to hear your ideas
                    and explain their ideas to you so the Soviet issue was worrisome to us but it
                    didn't prevent all Egyptians from having contact with us. I used to know an
                    Egyptian military officer who insisted on meeting in a sporting club, the Gezira
                    Club. I never fully understood that, but he wouldn't meet in a private place. He
                    was afraid that if we met at home the Egyptian authorities would suspect
                    something inappropriate was happening, that he was passing me information. So we
                    could sit out in the lawn of the Gezira Club and have tea in the afternoon and I
                    did that from time to time. He never provided me with a lot of information, but
                    we exchanged views on Egyptian and American foreign policy. We suspected that
                    the Soviets were poisoning the well with Egyptians, particularly with the
                    Egyptian security authorities about the United States and we knew that our
                    telephones were being monitored. In fact we'd periodically tell stories at staff
                    meetings about monitoring of the phones because the Egyptians were not very good
                    at it. They collected miles of recording tape of telephone conversations which
                    must have been innocuous. Stories would be like this, “Well, my wife was on the
                    phone talking with a Swedish diplomat and because we served in Sweden they went
                    into Swedish on the phone and they were interrupted by an Egyptian who came on
                    the line and said, 'please talk English',” because he didn't understand what
                    they were saying. And in another case, a person got a huge phone bill from the
                    phone company and called up to complain about it and they called her back and
                    said, “Well, we know you talked for half an hour with New York, and we can prove
                    it to you.” And they played her the recording of her conversation to prove that
                    she ought to pay the bill. So we told each other stories like that in order to
                    remind ourselves that the Egyptian authorities were watching everything we did
                    and we assumed that the Soviets were behind it. When you were talking on the
                    phone you could hear a conversation in the background. I mean they weren't very
                    good about hiding their monitoring and you could hear people playing music,
                    while they were listening to our conversations. And we assumed that the Soviets
                    had helped give them the equipment and the monitoring techniques.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was the feeling that the Soviets were calling the
                        shots? Or were they just going along for the ride and doing what they could
                        to make relations between the United States and Egypt worse?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>RUGH: More the latter. In the embassy I think the consensus was that Nasser was
                    taking the lead in his Arab nationalist policy which included a strong dose of
                    anti American imperialism, hostility to American imperialism, and that the
                    Soviets were opportunistically taking advantage of this because it fit exactly
                    with their purposes. And that the Soviets were delighted to be able to aid and
                    abet Nasser in his attacks on us. And of course this was about assistance for
                    the Aswan Dam and all of that played into this. But I think we fairly well
                    understood that there were Arab nationalist sensitivities that we had to take
                    into account. We thought they were being exploited by Nasser as well, but that
                    the man on the street was ready after decades of British colonialism and feeling
                    deprived and not sufficiently respected, that Nasser's pride or focusing on Arab
                    pride was touching a genuine popular feeling. When I was in Egypt the second
                    time, an Egyptian...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was there from 1976 to 81. An Egyptian film director made a film about
                    Nasser. It was very interesting because the film, in those days, during the
                    Sadat period, was supposed to be anti Nasser and the director's intention was to
                    show the evil side of Nasser's regime and rule. And he did very well showing
                    detention without habeas corpus and torture and demagoguery and so on. But he
                    made a mistake in his film when he came to the period of the 1967 War. He showed
                    that Egypt was losing but Nasser was claiming victory. That was fine, that
                    served the director's purpose very well. But then he included an excerpt from
                    Nasser's resignation speech, his famous resignation speech of June 1967, when he
                    said, “I take responsibility and I'm going to resign”. And the people rose up
                    and demanded that he come back. That speech was so powerful in speaking to the
                    Egyptian psyche that when it was included in the film in 1977 I guess, or 78,
                    the Egyptian audience, most of whom were too young to remember Nasser that much
                    were moved and the whole mood changed. They were affected by Nasser's words a
                    decade or more after it happened, 67 to 77 and the director blew it because he
                    included the words of Nasser. Nasser's delivery, his voice, his choice of words,
                    his rhetoric, his powerful oratory was something you had to experience to
                    appreciate. Even this Egyptian director didn't understand how powerful it was
                    and it was still having an effect on people long after Nasser was gone. So I
                    think at the time we tended to appreciate that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's very hard to translate that into getting people in
                        the United States to understand the power of somebody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, yes. You can't. You translate it in English it looks like
                    nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It looks like, you know, it didn't, those who didn't
                        understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RUGH: So I think we appreciated it. Not as much as we could have or should have
                    but we certainly appreciated it more than people sitting in the States who don't
                    have the context, who don't have a daily dose of discussion with Egyptians who
                    would genuinely empathize with what Nasser is saying and his general points. You
                    have to be there. It's almost like listening to Umm Kulthum. I tried to
                    appreciate Umm Kulthum who was then alive and singing every week and was the
                    great Arab singer and she mesmerized millions of Egyptians and other Arabs. And
                    I would sit and listen to her songs. It was hard to understand the words and I
                    wasn't part of the culture so I always felt like an outsider when I listened to
                    her. And it's similar with Nasser and his political rhetoric. I think, unless
                    you grow up in that society you could never fully appreciate the emotional
                    appeal that Nasser has had on people, or the emotional appeal that Umm Kulthum
                    had which was non political. But it's powerful, and it's like Arab poetry. Arab
                    poetry is very, very difficult for Americans, even if you've studied Arabic for
                    a long time, to understand because the words have special meanings and nuances.
                    And an Arab poet can move an Arab audience of native speakers, and this goes
                    completely over our heads or past us because we don't have that knowledge and
                    cultural background.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 28, 1996. So you left Egypt in 1966 and you
                        went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: To Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was in Saudi Arabia from 1966 until 1971. I had three different
                    assignments. My first assignment was as Assistant Public Affairs Officer at the
                    American Embassy in Jeddah. In 1967 I went to Riyadh as director of the USIS-run
                    English language center which was nominally under the Ministry of Education of
                    Saudi Arabia from 1967 to 1969. The embassy was still in Jeddah and there was no
                    U.S. diplomatic mission in Riyadh in those days, since the Saudis didn't allow
                    it to move to the capital, Riyadh. Then in 1969 I moved back to Jeddah in a
                    third assignment as Public Affairs Officer in the American embassy in
                    Jeddah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start first in Jeddah. When your in Jeddah
                        first, this is '66 to '67. Could you describe a little the embassy, who was
                        that the ambassador and what was the situation in Saudi Arabia at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>RUGH: The ambassador was Hermann Eilts. He was one of the great Middle East
                    experts in the Foreign Service and one of the great diplomats that I've ever
                    seen in the Foreign Service. He became for me a role model. I worked for him
                    both in Jeddah and in Cairo later. The deputy chiefs of mission were Talcott
                    Seelye, who later became ambassador to Tunisia and Damascus and I later became
                    his DCM in Damascus, and Bill Stoltzfus who later became ambassador in Kuwait,
                    responsible for the entire Persian Gulf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this is in a way sort of unusual because we were
                        loading an awful lot of our Arab talents there. Eilts, Stoltzfus, and Seelye
                        were all Arabists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: And there were more. Joe Twinam was the political officer. He later became
                    ambassador in the Gulf. And Fran Dickman was the economic officer. He later
                    became ambassador in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. So there was an extraordinary group
                    of people all under the leadership of Herman Eilts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you said: Twinam, Dickman, and the other one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Joe Twinam, Fran Dickman, Bill Stoltzfus, and Talcott Seelye all became
                    ambassadors. And just before I arrived, Dick Murphy was there as political
                    officer. He later became ambassador several times and assistant secretary. So
                    this particular embassy formed a number of people who became ambassadors in the
                    Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Isa Sabbagh there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No. He had been there earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place how did Herman Eilts, from your
                        perspective, obviously you're working in public affairs side, so how did he
                        use it and what was your sense of his operation, how did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>RUGH: From my perspective, he was a person who made effective use of everybody in
                    the mission. He didn't focus only on the diplomatic and political side. He was
                    interested in everything and he was a good listener. He listened to my reports
                    of what I was hearing from my contacts in the press and in the university. And
                    he found that important as part of the overall picture of his attempting to
                    understand Saudi society. I appreciated that he was interested and that when I
                    moved to Riyadh he came frequently to Riyadh and sat with me. He asked my
                    impressions of what was happening in Riyadh and the people I was talking to. So
                    it really encouraged me to do more in the way of reaching out and meeting people
                    and making contacts and finding out what was going on. He stressed that it was
                    important to reach out and make contacts wherever he could. He had his own plate
                    full, meeting officials and writing his reports. But he always had time for us
                    on the lowest levels on the embassy staff to listen and to encourage us to do
                    our work more aggressively. He was a workaholic. He worked every day almost
                    around the clock. He never stopped and this personal devotion and dedication to
                    his own job gave the rest of us encouragement and inspiration to work hard as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation? We're talking about 1966 which was
                        just abutting on 1967 which was a pivotal year in our relations with the
                        Middle East. What was the situation in Saudi Arabia as you saw it? And could
                        you talk about, this is a difficult society to penetrate and how did you go
                        about operations? We are pre the Six Day War of 67.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>RUGH: Right. The Saudis had their differences with Egypt in those days and during
                    that period the Saudis were not always in lock step with Nasser and the Egyptian
                    leadership of Arab nationalism. The Saudis for example had sponsored thousands
                    of Egyptian teachers to come to Saudi Arabia, but at one point they decided that
                    this was politically unwise to have Egyptian teachers all over the kingdom. The
                    Saudis decided the Egyptian teachers were bringing with them Arab nationalist
                    ideas ala Nasser which were not suitable for the Saudi approach. And there was
                    some competition between the Saudi King Faisal and Nasser in those days. So we
                    thought, in the embassy, that although the Arab nationalism which was very
                    important throughout the region was a problem for the U.S. and U.S. policy, it
                    was less of the problem in Saudi Arabia because of Faisal's different approach.
                    King Faisal was friendly to America and didn't seem to be affected by the Arab
                    nationalist hostility to the extent that other leaders were. However, in June,
                    1967 when the Arab-Israeli war broke out and Nasser accused the United States of
                    participating directly in the war, that hostility and that accusation did cause
                    us a problem. Just before the war broke out, a bomb went off in the American
                    embassy in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia, and we found out later that it was put there
                    by supporters of the Palestinians, the PLO. It caused us some concern because we
                    thought that Saudi Arabia had been immune to the direct effects of the
                    Arab-Israeli conflict and Arab nationalism. But it turned out that because of
                    the presence of Palestinians and other non Saudis in the Kingdom there was some
                    spillover. But we didn't evacuate during the June war in 1967. The State
                    Department gave Ambassador Eilts an instruction as I recall to evacuate and he
                    argued against that. He said we should stay because the Saudi government was
                    asking us to stay and was guaranteeing our security, and the Saudi government
                    said it would be an unfriendly act for us to pull all of our people out. That
                    there was considerable American involvement in the oil business in Saudi Arabia
                    as you recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly over in the eastern province.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: In the eastern province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ARAMCO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: For the American Embassy to evacuate would have led oil workers to be
                    tempted to evacuate. The Americans at ARAMCO might have left and that would hurt
                    oil production and the Saudis felt they had sufficient control over the security
                    situation that we should not go. Now this was a judgment call by Ambassador
                    Eilts. He turned out to be correct in that there wasn't any imminent danger to
                    American personnel living in the Kingdom, and there were quite a few in the
                    eastern province and so we stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling within the American community where
                        you were? I've been doing an interview with Clyde Taylor concerning a later
                        date, a decade later or more in Iran where the ambassador made the same call
                        and the community group was mad as hell because they wanted to get out and
                        as it proved, the situation was really dangerous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well we, in the embassy, relied on Ambassador Eilts' judgment and respected
                    his judgment in these matters and we had no reason to doubt that he was right.
                    The American community in Dhahran was a bit nervous because of what was going on
                    and we all made evacuation plans. But I don't recall that there was any
                    resentment over the decision to stay. As it turned out, the war didn't really
                    effect Saudi Arabia directly at all. So people were, after the first few days of
                    apprehension, they were relaxed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me how you went about your job, we're
                        talking about in Jeddah first?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Jeddah first and then Riyadh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jeddah first, and this is particularly before the Six Day
                        War, and then things turned sour because Nasser was claiming we had helped
                        with an air strike on them. Because he didn't want to have it known the
                        Israelis had wiped out his air force in a matter of minutes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, I had been in Jeddah for a year prior to the war and during that time
                    I had developed contacts primarily in the press and in the university. The
                    people that I met with were Saudis, of various persuasions. Some were
                    conservative. One or two were attracted to Islamic fundamentalism and to the
                    Muslim Brotherhood and they were always cordial and were pleased that I made the
                    effort to go to see them. They were not very active in seeking us out. We had to
                    go to see them. But when we did, they were very willing to talk about American
                    policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One policy essentially.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RUGH: One in particular. My public affairs officer, my boss, was George Thompson
                    who was also very outgoing and very active and he taught me to get out and meet
                    people and develop contacts wherever I could. And together the two of us got to
                    know quite a few of the people in the media and in the universities. The June
                    war in 1967 was a moment of intense activity on our part trying to explain that
                    the U.S. was not involved in the conflict. It wasn't easy because the Voice of
                    the Arabs radio coming out of Cairo was carrying the lie that we were involved
                    and most Saudis listened to the Voice of the Arabs. They didn't always believe
                    it, but this story concocted by the leadership in Egypt sounded too plausible
                    because it asserted American participation in the war, which explained how the
                    Israeli air force could have been so devastating. In fact, it was the Israeli
                    air force alone that had done the job. But at the time that was not known, so we
                    had difficulty persuading Saudis, and they really didn't believe us at first,
                    that we weren't involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there is a tendency anyway, in that part of the
                        world, isn't there to believe plots and conspiracies and all this? I found
                        when I was there and also in Greece and all, I mean as really in the United
                        States you know people enjoy plots.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That's right. And they don't trust the media. They don't trust official
                    media. Neither their own or ours. And so the Voice of America which wasn't
                    really very audible, had technical problems there, because of the distance.
                    Voice of America and BBC which were carrying the true story were not believed
                    because they were seen as official and therefore biased. They don't trust any
                    media. They tend to listen to as many as they can and try to make their own
                    conclusions. They tend to believe that there's much more to the story than they
                    are hearing from official sources or from any sources. So they do believe in
                    conspiracies and when we said this isn't true, about American participation,
                    they just didn't believe us. And so that was our major problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you tell me a bit about, you know when you'll
                        think about Saudi Arabia, you really don't think about the media or
                        universities playing much of a role. You think of the Princes Incorporated,
                        sort of running the place. What was your impression at this time of the
                        media, universities, and also Princes Incorporated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>RUGH: Well, the media were not free of government influence even though they were
                    in private hands, most of them. The Saudi businessmen who owned the media didn't
                    publish editorials or even news stories that were at variance with official
                    policies. So they didn't play a role independent of the state in Saudi Arabia.
                    However, media people were among the more educated and better informed Saudis,
                    having as their profession the requirement to stay abreast of events. And unlike
                    some Saudis who had been pretty isolated from the rest of the world, they had
                    followed international events. So, privately, they were quite interesting to
                    talk to and they had their personal views which once you've got to know them
                    they were not reluctant to express. And they did express various views
                    privately. In the universities it was similar. They didn't get involved in
                    politics at all in a sort of a public sense, but privately they were some of the
                    better educated people. Some of them had been educated in the United States and
                    had doctoral degrees so they were rather sophisticated. So there wasn't much
                    public dialogue about policy issues, but there was a lot of private discussion
                    among the people. If you saw them one on one they wouldn't be shy about
                    expressing their views.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, weren't you plugging in to probably even more
                        important a place and getting it out to the public, in a place like that?
                        Because I would imagine that these people were part of the corporation that
                        kind of ran Saudi Arabia weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, they were. To some extent they were passive, but they were among the
                    elite and were potentially a problem for the regime. The regime was very
                    interested in having their support, sort of the educated middle class if you
                    will. I wrote an article about the new middle class in Saudi Arabia which got
                    some attention from American academics because they'd never heard of an educated
                    middle class in Saudi Arabia. When I came back from the Kingdom I wrote about it
                    because I thought it was an emerging phenomenon. Saudi Arabia wasn't well-known
                    at that time and certainly very little was written about it. So it was an
                    important group we thought to keep in touch with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the universities, and also, did you find a
                        considerable number of Saudis were going to the United States to get
                        educated. Was this having much of an effect? We're getting into early
                        sixties, but students were getting a little bit rambunctious in the United
                        States. Did you see any effect there? Were they creating a different class
                        than say the normal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. And that's absolutely true. Many of my contacts in those days were
                    Saudis who had been to the United States for university education, either a
                    bachelor's degree or masters or doctorate. They felt a bit alienated from their
                    own society. Because they had studied in America they were more accessible to us
                    as Americans. Because there's a huge cultural gap between Saudi Arabia and the
                    United States. There was an even bigger one in those days. Saudis who had been
                    trained in America, some of them came back with American wives, felt that they
                    were sort of between worlds. So they felt comfortable talking to us and they
                    felt a little bit uncomfortable in their own society because the vast majority
                    of Saudi society had never had an experience of the kind that they had had in
                    America, or anywhere abroad. The Saudi government in those days was sending
                    thousands of students abroad and they quickly discovered that to send them to
                    Cairo or to Beirut was more dangerous politically than to send them to the
                    United States. Because in Cairo and Beirut they would hear Arab radical ideas.
                    In America they would hear Western radical ideas which were more easily
                    explained away and more easily dealt with when the Saudi graduate came back to
                    the Kingdom. So the government felt - they never said this publicly - but they
                    said it to us privately, that it was better to send their scholarship students
                    to America, and to some extent to the U.K. but mostly to America. So there was a
                    very large group always in the United States at that time and coming back
                    regularly. Today many of those people are in the cabinet and in senior
                    government positions because they have developed not only expertise which they
                    had from the beginning with that education, but also they developed their
                    careers in the Kingdom and done very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense any alienation with the United States?
                        Sometimes coming to the United States is not a positive for us. Speaking
                        sort of “our side” or whatever you want to call it. People are turned off
                        and all. But how did the Saudi students care for the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, I guess they admired many things about the United States. They were
                    to some extent critical of the libertarian atmosphere, but at the same time they
                    enjoyed being free and being for a time away from the restrictions of the social
                    pressures of living in Saudi Arabia. The ones I knew fairly easily shifted gears
                    and adapted to American society when they were here in the United States and
                    then when they went back readapted to their own societies. That is to say
                    outwardly. You know they dress differently, they talk differently, they behave
                    differently in front of their parents than they would have in Berkeley or
                    wherever. I knew Saudis who in the United States would dress like Americans and
                    would behave for all intents and purposes like Americans and then when they went
                    home, in front of their fathers, they would never speak unless spoken to, and
                    they would never smoke, and they would certainly never drink at home. So they
                    were dealing with two different worlds. The American women who married Saudis
                    and came back with them were sometimes a little surprised to see the change in
                    their new husbands from California to Riyadh.</p>

                        embassy in Jeddah. What was the feeling towards the Saudi government? King
                        Faisal was the king at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well we felt it was very stable and King Faisal was universally admired by
                    the Saudis and by us and by the expatriates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly in contrast to his brother, half brother
                        Saud.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, absolutely. And that was the comparison that was made. His
                    predecessor, Saud, the previous King, had a poor reputation amongst Saudis and
                    among Westerners. But King Faisal was very wise and considered to have good
                    judgment about dealing with his own domestic political situation as well as
                    foreign affairs. In his competition, if you will, with Nasser he developed a
                    policy of Islamic solidarity. He sought to develop support among other Muslim
                    nations as the leader of the Kingdom which, of course, has the two holy places
                    of Mecca and Medina. Holy to Muslims. At the time, we didn't regard this as
                    necessarily radical or dangerous to us, the Islamic movement. Because in
                    Faisal's hands it seemed rather benign. We regarded the Arab nationalism of
                    Gamal Abdul Nasser as more dangerous. Faisal never developed a charisma and the
                    international solidarity for his Islamic movement that Nasser developed for his
                    Arab nationalism. We, as I say, saw it as not a threat to the United States
                    really. Domestically he had to deal with conservative elements which in
                    retrospect I believe he dealt with much better than his successors did. He kept
                    them under control. He was devout. He was supportive of the Ulama, the religious
                    authorities, but he didn't let them get out of hand. For example there is, and
                    was at that time in Saudi Arabia, a group that we used to call the religious
                    police, the Mutaween, which in Arabic means volunteers. These were and are
                    people who enforced public behavior according to their version of Islam, which
                    means at prayer time you close your shop and you go to the mosque. It means that
                    women, according to their version of Islam, must be properly dressed and for a
                    Saudi woman that means veiled. And these men patrol the streets of the cities
                    enforcing the prayer times and the dress code. Now when they tried to enforce
                    the dress code with American women, this ran up against our belief about how
                    American women might dress. I believe that at the embassy, that American women
                    should dress so as not to offend the Saudis. But they certainly didn't have to
                    veil. And when one of these religious policemen tried to tell an American woman
                    that she should wear the veil and she reported that to the ambassador he
                    complained directly to the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Minister reported to
                    the King, and the King told the religious police to back off. So, there were
                    lines that were not crossed and the King supported us in that. I believed at the
                    time that the power and the influence of the Mutaween, the religious police,
                    would decline. In fact, it has increased in the past 15 or 20 years. And the
                    government has allowed it to gain more authority and power in the streets of the
                    cities of Saudi Arabia. So in retrospect, King Faisal seems now to have been a
                    person who kept the lid on these religious, right wing, conservative factions
                    and forces much better than his successors have been able to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression of Nasser's influence in Saudi
                        Arabia? Prior to the '67 war and at the time of the '67 war? Did you feel it
                        was on the rise? He had been around for quite a while now. On the decline?
                        No change?</hi>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>RUGH: We thought it was on the rise. In fact the June 1967 Arab Israeli War,
                    which now we know to have been the peak of Nasser's power - we didn't know that
                    at the time - we were afraid that he was continuing to gain support because his
                    lies about American participation in the war were believed. And we thought that
                    he was going to continue to increase his influence over the Arab world. That
                    didn't happen, but at the time we were afraid that things were going to get
                    worse. They were bad enough in terms of American officials always being on the
                    defensive about Israel and about what we were doing. We felt that we were not
                    properly understood, that we were misunderstood. And we were trying to explain
                    America's case so that our presence was benign and friendly. We were afraid that
                    Nasser's attack on America politically was growing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling at the time of the June 67 War?
                        Essentially Nasser, outmaneuvered himself by ordering the U.N. to withdraw
                        from, and the way the U.N. responded too promptly on this thing. But at
                        that, time just before the attack, did we see the danger? Was this something
                        where there was sort of an alert went up and said, “Oh my God, we might have
                        another Arab Israeli War”, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We didn't really recognize it to the extent. Just on the eve of the war it
                    seemed to be a very dangerous situation. But we didn't expect a war in the weeks
                    prior to it coming. We thought that it would be averted. We thought that there
                    was once again a crisis going to the brink and that the parties would pull each
                    other back. You see so many shouting matches in the Middle Eastern streets that
                    don't end up in fist fights because the crowd pulls the people apart. And we
                    thought it was another one of those where people were trying to save face by
                    making a lot of noise and they wouldn't actually go to war. And when the war
                    happened we were surprised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the feeling at the embassy towards Israel?
                        Before and just after the war? Was there a case you say of localitis, or
                        almost of non knowledge of Israel at the embassy and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RUGH: We had a daily dose of Arab nationalism, coming not only from Voice of the
                    Arabs and Egyptian sources but also to some extent from the people, the Saudis
                    we talked to. We heard every day that the United States was supporting one side
                    in the conflict and there were two sides to the issue. Why were we arming
                    Israel, why were we supporting Israel, why were we giving Israel the means to be
                    repressive against Palestinians? And that regular discussion had its effect on
                    us. I mean, we hadn't heard, you know as Americans sitting in Washington or any
                    place in the United States you don't hear this on a daily basis. And it's a
                    point of view and an argument that has some merit. So certainly there was some
                    sympathy within the American Embassy to the Arab view that the United States was
                    biased. Now, our job professionally was to explain and defend American policies.
                    We did that to the best of our abilities. Explaining the statements of the
                    President and the Secretary of State and other officials as we received them.
                    And explaining the views of the U.S. Congress and the views of the American
                    public and the American press. That was our job. We could, I think honestly, and
                    I never had difficulty trying to, I mean it was difficult, but I never found it
                    impossible to have an honest discussion in which I explained American views and
                    listened to Arab views in return. Partly because so often the Arab views were
                    exaggerated and based on misinformation or overstated cases. I mean they would
                    say, “all American information media are controlled by Zionists”. Well, it's not
                    true, and I would say so. And I would disagree with that. I would say, “ the
                    Arabs have an opportunity in America to make their case, and they should make
                    it, it's a free country and Americans who are fair minded will listen”. Well,
                    they did not always believe me that, but I believed it. So we could have an
                    honest, intellectually honest discussion about these issues and that was sort of
                    the bread and butter of our work in those days.</p>

                <p>RUGH: Yes, yes, yes. Well, we would argue for peaceful settlement. We would argue
                    for a dialogue and debate between the Arabs and Israelis. Our hearers were not
                    always convinced but we believed, I believed, in the case and could make it.
                    After 1978-79, when President Sadat made an agreement with Israel and regained
                    territory, Egyptian territory, on the basis of a peace agreement and a
                    negotiation, this discussion with Arabs was much easier for me. I could say
                    Nasser had failed, the PLO had failed in their approach. Sadat had succeeded.
                    Here's an Arab leader who negotiated and regained Arab territory. Because they
                    always told me we can only regain our territory by force because the Israelis
                    took it by force. And I always disagreed with that, but I could never sort of
                    cite an example until Sadat did it in '78, '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were sitting there in the embassy and talking about
                        you and the other officers, looking at Israeli actions and all this of
                        thinking that why couldn't they be a little more understanding or something
                        like that, or was there any?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>RUGH: I guess what bothered us most was that the Arabs we talked to saw no
                    difference in policy between Israel and the United States. You know, Israel as a
                    sovereign country made its own decisions. And we were always put in the position
                    of trying to defend Israeli policy when we thought that was unfair. You know, we
                    can defend American policy, that's fair. But why should we also defend
                    everything and anything that Israel does. So, we were always trying to show that
                    American and Israeli policies weren't identical. That was sometimes
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel the cold hand of political reality from the
                        United States coming in? Because there is a very strong, certainly at that
                        time, there was a very strong pro Israeli, very pro active organization and
                        almost rooted in the American political psyche. Did you feel that at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That fact was part of our trying to explain American policy and American
                    attitudes, American public and press and congressional attitudes to Arabs. We
                    attempted to explain the atmosphere in America, the discussion in America, the
                    attitude of ordinary Americans towards this issue as best we could. The other
                    answer to that question is that when we went, on home leave, we found ourselves
                    explaining Arabs to our American friends and American attitudes. And that wasn't
                    easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. (laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Because, when you start a discussion and try to explain Arab complaints
                    about Israel, the first reaction is often, well, this is an anti-Semitic
                    attitude and you've been brain-washed by those Arab terrorists, who just want to
                    destroy Israel and push it into the sea. So, you have to sort of start from the
                    beginning and try to explain the history and the attitudes that have developed
                    out of the history. And so we felt sort of between worlds. When we were home, we
                    were explaining the Arabs to Americans, and when we were in the Middle East we
                    were explaining Americans to Arabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two very difficult rows to hoe. One last question. At the
                        time of the '67 war, in the first place obviously you were concerned about,
                        “do we have to get the hell out of here, are there going to the mobs in the
                        street and all that”. But what was the sense of this? I say this because I
                        was in Yugoslavia at the time and the Tito government was very strongly pro
                        Arab and pro Nasser and all. And yet every Yugoslav took great pleasure in
                        the defeat of Nasser. Particularly I think since one of the division
                        commanders of the Israelis was of Yugoslav background which every Yugoslav
                        told you. I felt some exhilaration, because Nasser was not exactly our
                        favorite person. I was just trying to get your reaction, maybe officers of
                        the embassy at that time.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To the Arab defeat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I guess we didn't take much satisfaction. We were afraid that this was just
                    one more stage in the Arab nationalism conflict with Zionism and Israeli
                    nationalism and we were caught in the middle of it and it wasn't over, it was
                    getting worse if anything. It wasn't getting any better. So there wasn't any
                    great satisfaction in the fact that they had been beaten. We didn't want Nasser
                    necessarily to win, but we wanted the political temperature to be reduced and we
                    didn't see that that was happening. When Nasser resigned and then came back it
                    looked as if the Egyptian public and the Arab public thought he was a great
                    hero. We thought he was leading the Arabs down the wrong path and it looked as
                    if he was more popular than ever. Turned out that he wasn't. This was the
                    beginning of his downfall, or down slide.</p>

                        next time about 1967, the aftermath of the June 1967 War. You moved up to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 24, 1996. Now we're talking, you're in the
                        aftermath of the '67 war, immediate aftermath. What was sort of the feeling?
                        Had the Saudis ever made any move to get involved in the war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Not directly. The situation in Saudi Arabia was quite removed from the
                    conflict itself, and the conflict was over fairly quickly. There was a lot of
                    Saudi empathy with Egypt as the victim of Israeli attacks. But the war itself
                    didn't really affect us in Saudi Arabia. I moved to Riyadh in the fall of '67
                    and opened an English language center in the cooperation with the Ministry of
                    Education of Saudi Arabia. We began teaching English to Saudi government
                    officials that fall with no problem at all despite the fact that we were the
                    only embassy office in Riyadh, the embassy still being in Jeddah. The Saudi
                    government did support publicly the Egyptians on the occasion of the June War.
                    But there was very little fallout in our bilateral relations by the fall of '67
                    when I moved up to Riyadh.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Teaching English to government officials, you really in
                        many ways are tapping a certain elite there. These are people who are both
                        in the government and probably pretty well educated and all that. What was
                        your impression of this government bureaucracy, the Saudi government
                        bureaucracy? The people in it, and also their attitude towards Egypt,
                        towards Israel, towards the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The Saudis that we were teaching had not been exposed to the United States
                    directly. They were all officials who needed some English for their jobs. They
                    did not have any English from having visited the United States or the U.K. and
                    they had very little English from their schools. So we were probably the first
                    Americans they had met and they didn't have any personal, firsthand knowledge of
                    the United States. They didn't focus on the political issues that were dominant
                    in the region at the time even though when asked they would reflect some
                    sympathy with Arab nationalism and the Nasserist sentiments that were current at
                    the time. But they usually didn't bring it up. Out of courtesy or whatever they
                    tended to separate the personal from the official and regarded us as, after they
                    got to know us as their teacherteachers are respectethey regarded us as
                    individuals who could be respected regardless of American policy, which they
                    were, when asked, critical of. So they made a distinction. We tried to convey
                    some understanding of American culture and attitudes and so on. It was very
                    difficult because although they were people who were college graduates, but they
                    were not sophisticated in international affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression at this sort of like unique view
                        of the Saudi bureaucracy, the role of the Royal Family? I sort of had the
                        impression that you had some rather spoiled princes sitting in a lot of
                        ministries, while an awful lot of people did a lot of work for them down
                        below.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: There was some of that. But this was when King Faisal was still alive and
                    Faisal was universally respected and that helped to enhance the reputation of
                    the Royal Family as a whole. Nobody criticized Faisal. He was truly admired and
                    respected for his leadership and his intelligence and so on. So nobody that we
                    talked to was critical of Faisal. The other princes were less prominent in those
                    days then they are today. There weren't so many of them and they weren't so
                    prominent. The brothers of Faisal were in senior positions. But it seemed at the
                    time - 1967 - that the merit system was creeping in for senior positions in the
                    government. That is to say the princes still controlled the key jobs. The King
                    was obviously going to be always a Royal, but also the key jobs in Defense, and
                    Interior, and Intelligence, and in Foreign Affairs were held by Princes. But the
                    other jobs seemed to be increasingly open to non-Royals and that gave the
                    non-Royals some hope that they could aspire to some of the top jobs. So there
                    wasn't, at that time, so much of a feeling as there is today of criticism of the
                    princes taking the good jobs away from the others who had better
                    qualifications.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did sitting in Riyadh at this time with our embassy in
                        Jeddah, did you find yourself acting as a sort of reporting officer
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. Partly because we were the first non-military office to open in Riyadh
                    that belonged to the U.S. government. There was a Military Training Mission in
                    Riyadh that belonged to the U.S. government. They dealt with military affairs.
                    The embassy being in Jeddah didn't have any other connections up there other
                    than the military before we came in. So we opened doors to other parts of the
                    society and we did do quite a bit of reporting too. Ambassador Eilts at the time
                    was very supportive of our work and every time he came to Riyadh, he usually
                    came at least once a month, he would ask me to give him a briefing on what the
                    mood was in the city and he said he found it useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know when I was in Saudi Arabia, in Dhahran, in '58 to
                        '60, prime concern of all of us I think was whether the Palestinians, they
                        seemed to have had at that time a sort of strangle-hold on government
                        positions and also within the military too. What was the situation as you
                        saw it with the Palestinians at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The Saudis regard all non-Saudis who are working in the Kingdom as
                    “temporary”. They don't have the idea of a “melting pot” and giving citizenship
                    to foreigners, even Arab. And that applied to Palestinians as well as others.
                    So, the contracts that they gave to foreigners were often one year contracts and
                    had to be renewed every summer. This is for thousands of teachers, and for
                    government employees. So they felt they had some control over them, and they
                    wanted to keep the control because they didn't entirely trust any of the foreign
                    workers, even Palestinians and Egyptians. A large number of Egyptians were asked
                    to leave a few years before '67. Palestinians were treated with a little bit
                    more care because of the political connections that they had with the PLO and
                    the other Palestinian organizations. The government itself was careful to try to
                    prevent the Palestinian organizations from becoming hostile to the ruling family
                    and to the Kingdom. So they provided subsidies to the PLO and the other
                    Palestinian organizations. They tried to give them jobs in the Kingdom. There
                    was some sympathy for the Palestinians because of their struggle over Palestine.
                    But on a personal level there was a bit of resentment, there was mixed feeling
                    and a bit of apprehension that Palestinians could cause problems for the
                    Kingdom. Unlike Oman which didn't basically didn't allow any Palestinians in
                    Oman, next door to Saudi Arabia, because they didn't want any trouble, the
                    Saudis allowed a lot of Palestinians in and gave them jobs, but treated them
                    carefully because they regarded it as a potential political problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see any attempt by the Palestinians or outside
                        forces to stir up the Palestinians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>RUGH: No, we didn't. I think Faisal's approach worked. That is to say, he bought
                    them off. He gave them jobs. He gave the PLO generous funding, and this kept
                    them at bay. We don't know what would have happened if he hadn't done that. But
                    one assumes that they could have, would have caused problems if he had been less
                    generous and less hospitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a little about social life and living
                        conditions in Riyadh? Because you were sort of out there as an outpost at
                        that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well for us it was a unique opportunity because there were so few Americans
                    in town. My colleague Bill Royer ran the English language program, and I was
                    director of the Center. We were the only Americans outside of a few at the U.S.
                    Military Training Mission and, I think, one or two with the Ford Foundation
                    which was doing an administrative reform project for the government. The Saudis
                    who had studied in the United States were quite accessible to us, particularly
                    the ones who were not from Riyadh. The Saudis who had families, and parents, and
                    uncles, and aunts, and so on in the Western Province, in Jeddah, and were living
                    in Riyadh, working in the government, teaching in the university who had been in
                    the United States were very friendly and open to us and accessible. We had very
                    good social contact with them because they didn't have the family obligations.
                    For Saudis, if you're living in the same town with your parents, you have to go
                    visit them everyday. And they didn't have that because they weren't living in
                    Jeddah, and their parents were. They knew enough about America to be interested
                    in it and keeping up with what's going on in the States. So we had a number of
                    friends who were in the government and the university and in the business sector
                    who were of that type. Saudis who had never been to the United States or who had
                    family in Riyadh were much more difficult to get to know. But my wife did some
                    teaching of some of the princesses in Riyadh because they were interested in
                    learning English. She was one of the few native speakers around and as a woman
                    she could see and be seen by princesses. So she would be picked up by a
                    limousine and taken out to a palace every couple of days to teach English to
                    some princesses. Which turned out to be, in a two-hour session, about 15 minutes
                    of teaching and two hours of socializing and having tea and a mixture of Arabic
                    and a little bit of English. It was very interesting for her and they were very
                    friendly to her and very curious about America. So she would tell them about
                    America. She would sometimes take our children out, who were very young at the
                    time. So because there were so few Americans, and we were sort of a rarity,
                    access was quite good to certain groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From your wife were you gathering that there was any
                        discontent, not on the role of the lot of princesses as far as their role in
                        society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>RUGH: No. We didn't detect really much discontent at all. The Saudis that we knew
                    were quite optimistic about the future, were quite happy with their state. The
                    country was prospering, they were getting good jobs, certainly the educated ones
                    were getting good professional opportunities right away and they seemed to be
                    extremely content with their lot in life at that time. Men and women were very
                    strictly separated and segregated with the exception of those non-Saudi women
                    who were married to Saudis who sometimes went to social functions. But we
                    thought that that would change. It didn't really much, but (Laughter) we thought
                    it would.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was in Riyadh until '69 and then I moved back to Jeddah and I worked at
                    the embassy for another two years.</p>

                <p>RUGH: Five years in the Kingdom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Five years in the Kingdom. I was wondering, could you just
                        talk, I did an interview a long time ago, and I knew him when I was in
                        Dhahran very briefly, was Isa Sabbagh there when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No, he was there before I was. But the people still remembered him. He
                    actually set up the U.S. Information Service program that I was involved in
                    afterwards. But I know Isa from various encounters in Washington and elsewhere
                    and he was a very distinguished and prominent member of the USIA community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, when you went back you would this would be '69
                        to what, '71?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: '67 to '69 I was in Riyadh. '69 to '71 I was back in Jeddah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Hermann Eilts was there. When he left, it was Nick Thacher who replaced him
                    in 1970 before I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Jeddah?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>RUGH: In Jeddah, I went back as public affairs officer. I had been the assistant
                    public affairs officer earlier under George Thompson, went to Riyadh to direct
                    the English Language Center for two years and then came back as the public
                    affairs officer when Thompson left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this 1969 1971 period, what were the public affairs
                        issues that you particularly had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It was a relatively quiet period politically in bilateral relations. Our
                    focus was on attempting to increase Saudi understanding of the United States, to
                    broaden and deepen it. The Saudis who had not studied in the United States had a
                    very limited understanding of what America was all about. A number of Saudis
                    were going to the United States to study at that time. They came back with a
                    pretty good understanding of America, its complexities, and its character and
                    nature. But Saudis who had never been to America really didn't have a clue
                    because it's very hard to convey. They heard things from various Arab sources
                    which were not necessarily accurate. They saw Hollywood movies on trips abroad
                    and that didn't help. So, they really had a very narrow and distorted picture of
                    America. We focused a lot of our attention on trying to deepen that and also
                    trying to keep the Saudis who had been to the United States in touch with
                    America. It was very hard for them to keep up with developments in the States.
                    They didn't have professional journals, magazines, newspapers, or books. The
                    Saudis didn't read many books, but some of the scholars wanted to keep up on the
                    periodical journals in their fields and they didn't have them. So, we had a
                    small information center in downtown Jeddah and a library. We tried to use that
                    to reach out to Saudis, particularly Saudis who had studied in America. There
                    were a number of Saudi Ph.D.s from America at that time. So, we worked primarily
                    with them. We worked with Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, which had just
                    opened. It had a young faculty that was accessible to us. We worked with them.
                    They had a men's campus and a women's campus, so we were working indirectly with
                    the women and directly with the men.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a woman officer there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No. Our wives, to some extent, filled in. In those days, that's what wives
                    sometimes did: filled in and made some contacts at the university. There were a
                    few Americans who were teaching at the university. But the university, because
                    they had a lot of money, was able to completely segregate men and women and
                    provide duplicate facilities and have men teach by closed circuit television.
                    Some of us felt that if they hadn't had the money they would have had
                    coeducation. The female students would sit in a classroom, watch a television
                    screen and see the man. He would hear their questions on an intercom, an audio
                    circuit, but he couldn't see them. So, they had sort of a one way view and a two
                    way audio and the women were studying. The women did very well. The female
                    students at the university level and in the high school level were consistently
                    doing better than the young men. I think that's still the case.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, it reflects the society, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. I think it was for a number of reasons. One is that the women had a
                    lot of time at home to study because they weren't allowed to go out. The young
                    men were out driving around in their cars, having a good time, and not studying.
                    Also, they found this one of the ways that they could demonstrate their
                    individuality and their capabilities, so they really studied hard. They were
                    well motivated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought to getting a woman officer? We're
                        talking about the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was not a high point in
                        American use of women.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I don't remember that it came up. In those days, the Foreign Service still
                    regarded wives as unpaid employees. My wife and other wives in the embassy were
                    involved. At the time, Marjorie Ransom, who had been a USIA officer, was there
                    with her husband. She had been required to leave the Service because she married
                    a State Department officer, David Ransom. She was very active in meeting Saudi
                    women. She was interested because she was professionally qualified, but she
                    wasn't on the payroll. Later, Marjorie Ransom came back and rejoined the Foreign
                    Service. She has been very successful. She is now DCM in Damascus and her
                    husband is ambassador in Bahrain. But at the time, David was doing the political
                    job and Marjory as his spouse was unofficially doing this kind of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the old two for one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We in the United States were undergoing a real revolution
                        in civil rights during much of this time. How did we deal with this in Saudi
                        society?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>RUGH: The Saudis didn't really follow that issue terribly closely. They were more
                    interested in issues that were linked somehow to the Middle East. The Saudis who
                    had studied in America were interested in those issues, but as a general rule,
                    the issues they focused on had more to do with U.S. Middle East policy, with
                    what they thought was Israeli influence of the American media, and that kind of
                    issue. Your question reminds me of an exchange that took place just before I got
                    to Jeddah between Isa Sabbagh, who was then the public affairs officer in
                    Jeddah, and USIA headquarters. The headquarters sent out a worldwide
                    communication saying, “What do the Saudis and everyone else think of the Berlin
                    problem?” Isa came back and said, “They think as much about it as the Berliners
                    think of the Saudi problem.” The horizon of a small country is short,
                    regional.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a public affairs officer, how did you deal with the
                        Israeli issue? Here we were, a strong supporter of Israel. Stuff must have
                        been coming in every day about Israel, all of which was basically positive.
                        How did we deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We had to try to explain the context, to explain that it wasn't an isolated
                    element in American society, but part of the entire fabric of American
                    discussion about the world and America's familiarity with Europe and with the
                    Jewish issue as it developed during World War II in Germany in contrast to
                    America's relative lack of information and understanding of the Palestine
                    question (That was a British domain and the U.S. hadn't been involved.). We
                    tried to put it in that context and show that Americans didn't really have a
                    great deal of knowledge or understanding of the developments in Palestine
                    itself, but had a lot of sympathy with the Jews arising out of the Jewish
                    experience in Europe, and particularly in Germany. In that discussion, the
                    Saudis and the other Arabs that we encountered were at pains to try to explain
                    to us their interpretation of the history of Palestine. We probably learned a
                    fair amount from them as we hoped they learned from us about American attitudes.
                    So, there was an exchange on it and it wasn't as intense an issue in Jeddah in
                    the 1969-1971 period as it was in Damascus, Beirut, or Cairo. I had been in
                    Cairo and Beirut in previous years and it was usually topic number one. Jeddah
                    was a little bit removed from that. The Saudis had other things on their minds.
                    They were focused more inward, in spite of the fact that the Saudis empathized
                    with other Arabs. They were more focused on development, work, the petroleum
                    industry, and issues of that sort. It was an issue for them and they did
                    empathize with the Arab view, but it wasn't a daily obsession, as it is in other
                    places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1969-1971. This was the time when
                        Richard Nixon was President. He had come in in 1969. Did you feel any
                        movement from the outlook of USIA towards the work you were doing from the
                        Johnson administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: In terms of USIA as an agency?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in instructions, where you would be pointed towards,
                        and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No, I can't say that I noticed any real difference in terms of the
                    institution of USIA. We did notice, however, a growing interest in the Gulf at
                    that time. It was just beginning. In retrospect, it seems very minor, but in
                    this period, the Director of USIA, Frank Shakespeare, visited the Gulf and was
                    the first Cabinet member ever to go to Saudi Arabia. It was a big event.
                    Nowadays, Cabinet members go there practically every week for one reason or
                    another. Secretaries of Commerce, Secretaries of Defense, and Secretaries of
                    State are always popping into Saudi Arabia. But in those days, Washington didn't
                    pay much attention, at least on that level, to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.
                    President Nixon visited Iran. Then he sent Vice President Agnew to Jeddah. That
                    was an escalation that we were very impressed with, of the attention given to
                    Saudi Arabia, that the Vice President of the United States himself would come to
                    Saudi Arabia. Nowadays, that is commonplace. In those days, we felt that it was
                    a very positive sign that the movers and shakers in Washington were recognizing
                    the importance of Saudi Arabia. Of course, working in the U.S. embassy in Saudi
                    Arabia, we appreciated that, as did the Saudis. Of course, Agnew didn't last
                    very long, but at the moment, it was something that we were all very pleased
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Agnew trip? Was he focused on what we
                        were doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: He was. He was interested. Ambassador Eilts briefed him on the situation
                    and introduced him to the King and the local leaders. He showed interest. We
                    were pleased that he showed interest. It was a courtesy visit. I don't think
                    that he had a specific mission. The Saudis were very pleased to have access to
                    the White House directly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the Public Affairs office in the
                        embassy during this 1969 1971 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Ambassador Eilts was one of those people who recognized the role of every
                    single element in the embassy. Not all ambassadors do. Some ambassadors have
                    come up through the political track and become super political officers and pay
                    much more attention to political reporting and, if there is military, a little
                    bit of that. But Ambassador Eilts was interested in everything. So, he gave us a
                    lot of support, as he did all sections of the embassy. He listened carefully
                    when we had something to say and gave us excellent guidance on how to carry out
                    our programs, so we felt that we were really part of the team. That gave us a
                    lot of encouragement. He was interested in what books were in the library, what
                    films we were showing at the Center, what visitor grants we were giving and how
                    we were making the selection in the student exchange program. He was interested
                    in all of that. That really made us feel that we were doing something
                    worthwhile. Not only USIA Washington headquarters was interested, but the
                    ambassador himself. That was very gratifying.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: He had been, I believe, deputy chief of mission earlier in Jeddah and had
                    gone off to another assignment, I believe, in Iran, and then came back as
                    ambassador to Jeddah when Eilts left. He was more low key, a very decent man, a
                    very good professional, not as familiar with the Middle East as Eilts, not a
                    workaholic like Eilts (but I don't think anybody is), but a very solid and
                    respected professional.</p>

                        society, I think there are at least two predominating subjects in our
                        literature. One references to Israel and the other to sex, romance,
                        intermingling of genders. How did you deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>RUGH: We had to be careful to balance Saudi sensitivities and censorship against
                    being accurate and true to American content in our publications. We didn't put
                    in our library anything that was directly contrary to the censors. We brought in
                    all of the material through the pouch, but we didn't want it to cause us to be
                    shut down by the censors or cause anybody any unnecessary grief. I believe we
                    sent Time and Newsweek through the censors deliberately so that we wouldn't run
                    afoul of the censors, but we brought the other materials in through the pouch. I
                    remember one incident where Life Magazine published an article on Islam and had
                    a picture on the cover or perhaps inside of Mohammad. For Muslims, that is a
                    sacrilege to depict the Prophet. We had brought it in the pouch, didn't think
                    about it, weren't screening everything that carefully. We put the magazine on
                    the shelf and a Pakistani resident in Jeddah went to the police and said, “This
                    American Center is carrying anti Islamic literature.” The government seized it
                    and complained to us. They didn't shut us down. That was a warning to us that we
                    ought to be more careful about what we put on our shelves. We didn't see any
                    point in offending people just for the sake of freedom of the press. The Life
                    Magazine people heard about this incident. I think they had trouble also in
                    other places, including in Pakistan in particular. The following issue of Life
                    had a little sidebar in one of the inside pages, which said, “Last week's
                    article on Islam upset some Muslims for some reason. They didn't like the
                    picture of Mohammad” and they reprinted the picture again to show readers what
                    picture had offended Muslims, so we had to yank that picture from the library.
                    But generally speaking, we didn't have a lot of trouble. We watched this issue.
                    A friend of mine who was a professor at the university and had a Ph.D. from
                    Rutgers in economics made a visit to the United States that summer in 1970 and
                    came back with some books that he had bought in the bookstore in the States. The
                    people at the airport in Jeddah confiscated his Plato's Republic, saying that
                    Saudi Arabia is a monarchy and this was not allowed. So, that is the kind of
                    indication... We talked directly to the censorship people. The censors had the
                    practice of taking a broad tipped black marking pen and marking out anything
                    that was slightly revealing in pictures of women. Something like Playboy wasn't
                    allowed at all, but anything in Time or Newsweek such as bathing suits would be
                    blacked out by the censor. Each individual copy would be blacked out by hand by
                    the censor guys over in the Ministry of Information.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Saudi Arabia didn't allow public cinemas. There were some private cinemas
                    which were illegal but clandestine which brought in films and showed them. We
                    brought in films and showed them at the Cultural Center, but they were all very
                    tame and unobjectionable from the censor's point of view. These were
                    documentaries about the United States. But the Saudis as a matter of policy
                    allowed television. Anybody could watch all the television they wanted because
                    they controlled the content of the television, but they didn't allow public
                    cinemas. They periodically shut down private cinemas which tried to open.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect that they had, as they had when I was in Saudi
                        Arabia, a rather complex underground where those with money had their own
                        projectors and all sorts of pictures. French pornographic films did very
                        well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. We understood the same thing. The Saudis were creative about
                    smuggling them in and showing them privately. They did have projectors at
                    home.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The books and the novels were much less rigorously censored, partly because
                    the censorship staff didn't have the capability of reading anything in English.
                    If it was in Arabic, they could skim it and they might censor it, but they
                    weren't so tough on anything in a foreign language and they weren't so tough on
                    the printed word. They were more after pictures, photographs, drawings, and so
                    on. That was something sort of simple that they could deal with. So, the censors
                    were really focused more on magazines and periodicals than on books. The Saudis
                    didn't, as a general rule at that time, read a lot of books. They read magazines
                    and periodicals and they watched films and so on, but they weren't big book
                    readers. We had about 3,000 volumes in our library and they were used only by a
                    small segment of the population.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I came back to Washington and worked in USIA headquarters for five years
                    from 1971 to 1976. One of those years, I did a year in New York at the Council
                    on Foreign Relations. The other four years, I was at USIA headquarters.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was in the Area Office. It was the Near East and South Asia Bureau of
                    USIA. This corresponds geographically to the State Department's Near East and
                    South Asia Bureau. My first job was policy officer in 1971 for a year. Then I
                    went off to New York to the Council. Then I came back as the deputy director of
                    the area. There were two deputies. I did the Near East and another officer did
                    South Asia. The director of it did the whole area corresponding in geography to
                    the Assistant Secretary of State for NEA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They must have been two different policies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, no. We handled it all out of one office, as does the State
                    Department. We saw it as one policy. Our operation in Israel was different on
                    the ground, in the field, because we had different problems and different types
                    of criticism of the United States. Our program in Israel was different partly
                    because the intensity of the interaction was much greater than in a place like
                    Saudi Arabia. There are so many Israelis who know America first hand that you
                    don't have to focus on the basics, as you did in a place like Saudi Arabia. They
                    know the basics (or they think they do because they've been there or were maybe
                    even born and raised there). So, they may be Americans by birth and passport
                    even. So, it is a very different audience from the one we had in Saudi Arabia.
                    When you come to policy on the peace process, on the '67 war, or on shuttle
                    diplomacy, we tried to be consistent and say the same thing to all audiences. If
                    you don't, you get in trouble. It's not intellectually defensible and it's not
                    smart either to say different things to different people. The questions we got
                    were quite different, that's true. The Israelis didn't complain about Zionist
                    control of the media in America as the Arabs did. We had a big Fulbright program
                    there. We sent a lot of cultural presentations to Israel, performing artists,
                    dance troupes, and so on. We never sent a dance troupe to Saudi Arabia.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>RUGH: The constant issue was the Arab-Israeli problem, Palestine and Israel, and
                    why was the U.S., in the Arab view, biased in favor of Israel and unfair to the
                    Palestinians and the Arabs. That was hanging over us all the time. The other
                    issues were not as prominent as they are now. That is to say, issues such as
                    Gulf security and Iran. Iran was a major program country for USIA. We were
                    teaching English. We had a lot of student exchanges. We had scholars going out
                    there, faculty exchanges. We were working with the companies that were there.
                    The Bell Helicopter people and other companies were there. The U.S. military was
                    there. We sent some of our most senior USIA officers to Iran because it was a
                    country which was very important to us strategically, politically, and
                    economically. We were very closely allied with the Shah. Some of us were
                    concerned about the public relations aspects of the large American presence at
                    the time, but we didn't foresee the revolution. This was 1971-1976. We didn't
                    imagine that the Shah would be overthrown. He seemed to be very solid. Our
                    policy in the Gulf was two pillars: Iran and Saudi Arabia. These were staunch
                    anti-communist, pro-American, pro-free enterprise, in close alliance with the
                    United States, so they were the basis of our policy and they seemed to both be
                    very solid. There was a big of concern about too much American presence causing
                    a nationalist criticism of the U.S. in Iran, but we never imagined that it would
                    all come tumbling down as it did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about India and Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We tended to separate India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal
                    from the Middle East in our management of programs. The people who had served in
                    that area and were serving in the area office in the bureau back in Washington
                    had a somewhat different experience. I think in retrospect, it was a mistake to
                    separate them too much. I didn't deal very much with India and Pakistan. My
                    counterpart, the other deputy director, did that area. But he didn't have a lot
                    to do. There wasn't much going on of a crisis nature.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there the breakup of Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It happened a little bit earlier, in 1971. In South Asia, we didn't have
                    major contentious issues as we had in the Near East. We were very, very busy in
                    the Near East dealing with a lot of hot issues, particularly the Arab Israeli
                    conflict, but in South Asia, the programs were more routine. We had large
                    numbers of American USIA personnel in South Asia, hundreds of Indian employees
                    in India, and dozens of Americans carrying out fairly standard and routine
                    information and cultural programs, particularly on the cultural side. India was
                    a problem in the sense that it was, as a leader of the non aligned, highly
                    critical of a lot of things that we did everywhere in the world. That was a
                    political problem. But that had been going on for a long time and it wasn't
                    cyclical and it didn't peak. It just was a constant effort on our part.</p>

                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>RUGH: That was another crisis in U.S.-Middle Eastern relations. The Arabs saw it
                    very differently from the Israelis, as all of the wars are seen. We weren't at
                    the time quite sure how it would come out. It turned out to have some long-term
                    salutary effects on the Arab attitude toward the peace process and so on. But at
                    the time, we weren't quite sure. It was a problem, once again, of trying to
                    explain to Arabs that we were following American national interests and we were
                    seeking a peaceful and a fair settlement. We weren't simply letting the Israelis
                    decide our policy, and we weren't simply providing weapons to Israel to do with
                    whatever they wished. That was the constant discussion. It came up again and
                    again and again. It didn't get any better until later in 1979 with Camp
                    David.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Oh, yes. Very clearly, and it became much more evident later in the late
                    1970s. But already in the mid-1970s, there was less animosity in Washington
                    toward the Egyptian leadership. During the Nasser period, there was a feeling
                    that Nasser was leading the hostile forces against American policy and we were
                    just being treated unfairly. Sadat had a different approach. Although he was a
                    prot�g� and a successor of Nasser and, to some extent, continued along similar
                    lines, it gradually dawned on us that he was a different kind of person. By
                    1977, when he went to Jerusalem in November not wanting to wait any longer for
                    the peace process to work, we realized that we were dealing with a different
                    person. So, I think that was the real turning point. In November of 1977 when
                    Sadat went to Jerusalem, everybody realized that we had a different situation on
                    our hands.</p>

                    agreed with him. But he had a certain charm that carried his views quite far. He
                    was very excited and enthusiastic about USIA and its work. He believed deeply in
                    the importance of information programs and wanted to use them for the interest
                    of the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>His management style was, to some extent, to get into the details of issues that
                    he liked, but to spot people that he could motivate and to encourage them to be
                    more proactive, aggressive, inventive, and creative. He was somewhat
                    controversial because of his very conservative views. We didn't always agree
                    with that. He sometimes went off and misunderstood things. When he was pushing
                    something that we believed in, we thought he was terrific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you went to Egypt, where you were from 1976 to 1981.
                        You spent a lot of time there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was the public affairs officer at the American embassy in Cairo during
                    those five years. That was at the time the biggest USIS program in the Arab
                    world. It was a period in which we saw the Camp David agreements and the
                    negotiations between Egypt and Israel supported by American diplomatic efforts
                    resulting in a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning when you arrived in 1976.
                        What was the state of the game in Egypt at that time? You had been there and
                        now were back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Since I had served in Egypt in the 1960s for a year under the Nasser
                    regime, coming back, the contrast was striking for the American embassy. In
                    Egypt under the Nasser period, the host government was overtly hostile to
                    American policy in many respects. This made contact with Egyptians extremely
                    difficult. In 1976 when I came back, the government was quite friendly. The
                    Sadat government in 1976 was in a period of preparation for a peace initiative
                    which came in 1977. There was a major turning point in our relations in the
                    1977-1978 period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy aware that Sadat was ready to make his
                        move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No, we weren't, but the atmosphere was already different for us. Sadat had
                    in 1973 crossed the Canal, made some military moves which he pointed to with
                    pride. Even though the end of the 1973 conflict resulted in no real gains
                    militarily, the October war of 1973 was used by the regime as a preparation for
                    what later became the peace initiative by Sadat going to Jerusalem in 1977 and
                    signing a peace agreement with Israel. We didn't know that was going to happen,
                    obviously, in 1976. Sadat surprised us in 1977.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>But already, the atmosphere was different. He had already initiated a new
                    economic policy which was very different from Nasser's. He never specifically
                    identified what he called the “Infitah,” the opening of the economy as a
                    reversal of Nasser's socialism, but that is what it was. He welcomed investment.
                    He supported the private sector and capitalist expansion. It was pretty clear
                    already in 1976 that he was changing the ground rules for the relationship with
                    the West by taking those economic measures. Nasser had taken many steps in the
                    direction of socialism and state control of the economy. Sadat was reversing
                    that but doing it in a way that did not specifically attack Nasser, who was
                    still a folk hero with many Egyptians. But in practice, the situation was
                    different. The people in the media that I was dealing with who during the Nasser
                    period had been very hostile to us were now restricted in what they could say.
                    The people who were more conservative, pro-West, and pro-private enterprise in
                    the media were allowed to speak out. So, it was already clear in 1976 that the
                    atmosphere was better for us. Then in November 1977, after some attempts by the
                    United States to broker an agreement with Israel had been tried and failed,
                    Sadat went to Jerusalem. That really changed the whole basis of the whole
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, I am still looking at this 1976
                        period. Was it your feeling that the Nixon Ford administration had kind of
                        shot its bolt in a way as far as the Middle East was concerned by this time?
                        We're talking about moving into an election year. Did you have the feeling
                        that there was anything going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: At the time, since there had been so many failed attempts at a peace
                    settlement, it didn't seem particularly new or surprising that the latest
                    attempts had failed. In retrospect, I think we realized that Sadat was
                    frustrated by the failure of any progress to be made with our intervention and
                    so he took a step of his own. I don't think we realized it in 1976 that he was
                    ready to take that step. Since practically the beginning of the Arab Israeli
                    conflict, the United States had urged countries to get together. We had asked
                    the Arabs to negotiate with the Israelis and that was our policy. That was what
                    we had asked them to do. But they never did it. Certainly Nasser refused to do
                    it. Sadat gave no indication that he was going to break that tradition and go to
                    Jerusalem. In fact, when he offered to go to Jerusalem, there were a lot of
                    people who thought he didn't really mean it. When he went, I think, everybody
                    was surprised and pleased. So, prior to his trip to Jerusalem, it was really
                    more of the same, namely, we were trying, but not succeeding. Nothing was
                    moving. It was the same old stalemate between the Arabs and the Israelis that
                    wasn't getting anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, you say, it was the largest USIS
                        post in the Arab world. What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>RUGH: We were doing the whole range of USIS activities, including working with
                    the media, which were more open than they had been in the 1960s when I was
                    there. Journalists and editors were very accessible and they hadn't been in the
                    1960s. We worked with the universities, which were accessible. We worked with
                    selected departments in Cairo University, Ain Shams University, and Alexandria
                    University doing educational exchanges, faculty and student exchanges, and a
                    Fulbright program. We had the whole range of cultural presentations for Egyptian
                    audiences, dance programs and musical programs. The field was wide open for us
                    and the Egyptians were very receptive to American cultural and educational
                    programming, as well as to information programs. We had money in those days and
                    a budget. We had a large staff of Egyptians and Americans. So, there were
                    opportunities for us. Doors were open. Egyptians were willing to listen to us.
                    There were no political barriers to what we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the universities or with the media, what about obvious
                        affinity towards Israel and all? This is an election year, particularly when
                        Florida and New York come into play, things are said about Israel that don't
                        reverberate very well in the Arab world. Was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, it was. It was always a problem. It continued to be the background
                    music for everything we did. But in those days, and this happened elsewhere in
                    the Arab world, once you establish a personal relationship with people, they get
                    past the standard litany of criticism of American support for Israel and talk
                    about other things. It was always there. Every time there was an event or an
                    incident that brought it to the front pages, you talked about it. It was still
                    part of the pre-1977 era in 1976 which had existed for a long time, where we
                    were arguing for a peaceful settlement and direct talks and they were
                    disagreeing. I guess we realized this even more after 1977. A change took place,
                    but it was still a period where we weren't making much headway in debating the
                    question and persuading people intellectually to accept our view. They still
                    supported the PLO, non recognition of Israel, and non negotiation. They still
                    were highly critical of American support for Israel militarily, politically, and
                    economically.</p>
                <p>But there were other issues that Egypt was interested in. Egypt had serious
                    economic problems. They were focused on those. This was also a period when the
                    Egyptian government was giving prominence to economic issues and the United
                    States was trying to be helpful. The Egyptian government attempted to solve some
                    of the economic problems by increasing the prices of subsidized commodities or
                    removing some of the subsidies. That caused major political reaction which
                    reminded the regime that it wasn't easy to solve the economic problems. So, we
                    were focused to a large extent on economic issues. There was a huge AID mission
                    there already, although it got much bigger after Camp David. It was already
                    quite large. We were discussing with the Egyptians how to deal with their
                    economic problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a problem with this huge AID mission?
                        Sometimes if you put an awful lot of American experts and support staff into
                        a country, a different culture and all that, it doesn't sit very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: There were some problems, but they became greater later in my tour there as
                    the real increases in aid came. From USIA's perspective, we were interested in
                    getting credit for our economic assistance. Within the mission, there were
                    differences of view. Many AID people were only interested in economic assistance
                    for the sake of development and didn't care about any public relations,
                    political payoff, benefit, and recognition by the public, whereas the front
                    office, USIS, and the Political Section were looking for some political benefit
                    from it. So, we had discussions along those lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Herman Eilts was the ambassador at the beginning of the period and then it
                    was Roy Atherton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had two real professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there, what was the estimate of Sadat at
                        that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: When he took over from Nasser, he was considered by outsiders and many
                    Egyptians to be fairly weak. He had not yet proven himself to have his own ideas
                    and policies. He was very careful to move gradually. The embassy and the
                    ambassador in particular had quite a bit of contact with him because of the
                    shuttle diplomacy that had been conducted by Henry Kissinger in an attempt to
                    get agreements. I think the embassy was beginning to regard him as a more
                    substantial person in his own right, in contrast to just being in Nasser's
                    shadow. The Egyptians considered him simply a flunky of Nasser when he was Vice
                    President. Many people thought that Nasser had named him Vice President because
                    he was weak and didn't want anybody strong as his Vice President and it was just
                    an accident of fate that he became President when Nasser died unexpectedly. By
                    1976, people were beginning to see him as having his own ideas, but that was
                    only gradually beginning to dawn on us and the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about during the election of 1976 in the United
                        States? This was when Carter beat Ford. At the end of 1976 with a new
                        administration, a new democratic Carter administration coming in, did you
                        see anything there that looked promising or unpromising?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>RUGH: We didn't know what it would bring for us and for foreign policy. Jimmy
                    Carter did not have, at least as far as we knew, a detailed foreign policy plan,
                    except that he talked about human rights. The Egyptians picked up on that issue.
                    They talked about whether Carter would recognize that Palestinians had human
                    rights as well or would this just be another American President who supported
                    Israelis and not Palestinian human rights. So, there was some interest, but
                    nobody was sure what the new administration would bring. It wasn't until later
                    after Camp David that people saw Carter in a different light and began to
                    realize that he did have a great interest in the Middle East and studied it
                    carefully and understood the Palestinians and Egyptians quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the university students? Did you see a change
                        in student orientation? Were they more receptive to America? Were they going
                        to the United States or were they going elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: They were. Egyptians didn't have a lot of money to send students to the
                    United States on scholarships and so on, neither the government or the private
                    sector, but there was a fairly good Fulbright program. There were AID trainees
                    that were going. The Egyptians were increasingly interested in the United
                    States. They often made a distinction between American foreign policy, which
                    they didn't like, and American education, which they admired, especially on the
                    technical side (science, engineering, medicine, and so on). So, there was an
                    interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing any fundamentalist movement within Egypt
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It was just barely beginning. The answer is yes, but it became more visible
                    and more intense as the decade went on. By 1976, there was and there had been
                    for a number of years a growing interest. This goes way back to the 1967
                    military defeat which gave an impetus in Egypt and elsewhere to Islamic
                    fundamentalism, partly because the Egyptians were trying to explain how they had
                    lost so disastrously in 1967. So, there was that general impetus. The student
                    unions or the student organizations on the campuses showed at that time, and
                    even more so later in the decade, an ability by the Islamic students, the so
                    called Islamic fundamentalist students, to organize and to provide services to
                    students that were quite effective. They began to provide female students with
                    clothing and transportation to classes, which for the less wealthy, lower middle
                    class Egyptian female students was very important. So, you began to see a
                    growing influence of Islamic student groups and they began to win elections on
                    the campus. They were much better organized than the leftist groups, the secular
                    groups, or the moderate groups. They were very determined, very deliberate, and
                    very effective. That was already happening on the campus by 1976.</p>

                        Jerusalem, how was this seen initially by the embassy by you and by others?
                        Did it seem like a ploy or a real thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It happened pretty fast. In the few days between the offer, the acceptance,
                    and the trip, I guess we were simply bystanders watching in amazement that this
                    was happening. I think most of us didn't really believe it when we first heard
                    his offer. Even if we thought he was serious, we thought the Israelis wouldn't
                    accept. Then they accepted and then he went. All of that was astonishing. It was
                    historic. No Arab leader had ever done that before. We were simply watching. I
                    am quite sure that our ambassador had a role in conveying the messages back and
                    forth. He may have been more persuaded than the rest of us that it was really
                    going to happen, but when it happened, we were all amazed. We felt he gave a
                    very effective and powerful speech in front of the Knesset. I remember our
                    apprehension that the Egyptian public would not accept what he had done. I went
                    out and watched the return from Jerusalem. He came in from the airport in an
                    open car, standing up in the back, waving at the crowd. The crowd was enormous
                    all the way in from the airport. Just an incredible crowd. It was friendly,
                    welcoming him back, cheering for him, and pleased. This continued for the next
                    months. The welcome was partly relief that something was being done to resolve
                    the conflict, plus another factor, which was an expectation that when the
                    conflict with Israel was over, economic prosperity would come to Egypt. So,
                    those two things. They were tired of the conflict, the fighting, going to war,
                    getting killed, losing treasure and human life. But they also had very high
                    expectations that this would bring sudden prosperity. They were focused on
                    economic problems. Sadat judged the mood of the public correctly. We didn't know
                    if he had or not until we saw the public reaction. The public mood was very
                    positive except for a very small group of intellectuals and others who said,
                    “This is a sellout. This is a concession.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His Foreign Minister resigned, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. And there were others. In fact, some of the people that we saw at USIS
                    in the universities, the intellectuals, the professors, and some of the people
                    in the media, said, “This is all a big mistake and we shouldn't make a
                    unilateral concession because the Israelis will put it in their pocket and want
                    more.” But the mood of the rest of the public was very positive, which was a
                    real relief to us at the embassy because I certainly wasn't sure what it would
                    be. On balance, I felt that this was a real step forward and that Sadat had done
                    us and the region a favor by making this step. The fact that a small group was
                    opposed and was wringing their hands didn't bother us all that much. We felt
                    that he had captured really the mood of the majority in doing this.</p>

                        an increased interest in the state of Israel, how it operated, where it was
                        going, etc.? Were you passing on information about Israel or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>RUGH: A little bit. Not a great deal. Not as much as you might think. Egyptians
                    were really absorbed with their own problems and they weren't terribly curious
                    about Israel. As time went on and as we got into the negotiations at Camp David
                    and the peace treaty, I guess we expected a lot more interchange between Israel
                    and Egypt and that really didn't happen. A lot of those intellectuals who were
                    opposed to his initiative refused to go to Israel. Some still refuse to this
                    day. So, there wasn't that much curiosity. There was curiosity on the Israeli
                    side. When the peace treaty was finally signed, there were Israelis who came
                    over to Egypt. That was an interesting development. But there weren't a lot of
                    Egyptians who were rushing over or who were asking us what was going on over
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When one thinks of Egypt, you think of the Nile Valley. I
                        don't know how broad it is. It has a huge population which keeps getting
                        bigger. How were you all thinking about whither Egypt, particularly
                        economically? This was really the key question with Egypt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I guess we were all concerned that a lot of smart people had tried to help
                    Egypt solve its economic problems and nobody had come up with a real solution.
                    The problems were persistent: overpopulation, limited resources, a government
                    owned economy or economic institutions which were very inefficient, guaranteed
                    jobs, the bureaucracy and the government industries full of people they didn't
                    need who were getting in each others' way. There were a lot of inefficiencies in
                    the system. But the Egyptians didn't want to remove the subsidies that had been
                    put on in the Nasser period. They said it was politically dangerous. I guess we
                    began to realize that it was when they had a reaction to the IMF's
                    recommendations and to the removal of the subsidies. We were concerned that the
                    economic problems weren't being solved and nobody really had a solution. There
                    wasn't a simple formula that could be applied that we knew about. We were trying
                    to help the Egyptians sort that out, but without a lot of success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the reaction of the rest of the Arab world where
                        Egypt was put beyond the pale for quite a while? How was that treated within
                        Egypt as you saw it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>RUGH: When we got into negotiations between Egypt and Israel in Camp David and
                    then the peace agreement, we at the embassy were delighted that this had all
                    worked, that there was actually the first agreement between an Arab country and
                    Israel in so many years. However, we were a bit concerned when most of the rest
                    of the Arab world reacted by boycotting Egypt. The boycott wasn't airtight. It
                    was leaky and it wasn't universal, but it was of concern because as a result of
                    that boycott, there was a strengthening of the group within Egypt which was
                    opposed to what Sadat was doing. The Arab nationalists were strengthened,
                    saying, “We told you so. This was a mistake to go to Jerusalem. It was a mistake
                    to surrender at Camp David” (as they saw it). The rest of the Arab world is now
                    isolating Egypt. Sadat said that Egypt was isolated. He said, “The rest of the
                    Arab world is isolated itself because Egypt is bigger than anybody else and we
                    are the mother nation. It's their problem, not ours.” But a lot of Egyptians
                    didn't believe that and were worried about it. To some extent, it affected
                    remittances of Egyptians living abroad. In the sector I was working in, which
                    was press and culture, there was a period at least at the beginning of this
                    boycott where the Egyptian film industry suffered, for example, because Egyptian
                    films were the best in the region and they were all over the Arab world. The
                    film industry and the television film industry was exporting to the Gulf, to
                    North Africa, and to the whole region. Those exports were suddenly blocked. The
                    problem was resolved to an extent, but it took time. The resolution happened in
                    this way. Instead of Egypt producing a television film series of 13 weeks of
                    soap operas which were sold to Kuwait Television, the actors, directors, and
                    stage set designers moved to Kuwait and worked in Kuwaiti studios producing soap
                    operas that were written, acted, and produced by Egyptians, paid for by
                    Kuwaitis, and done in a Kuwaiti studio. You could tell this was happening
                    because in the Gulf, they have modern, brand new sets, and in Cairo, they have
                    old shabby sets. So, you could see that something had changed. The title at the
                    beginning of the soap opera each night was “Produced by Kuwait Television,” but
                    it was simply transporting all of this Egyptian talent into the Gulf. So, they
                    got a new lease on life in that sense. Egyptian writers, actors, and directors
                    are talented. They found a way around this boycott. Newspaper subscriptions were
                    cut way down for distribution in the Gulf and this was a problem, but they got
                    around it eventually. The bulk of their sales are within Egypt anyway for
                    Al-Ahram and Al Akhbar and Al Gomhuria. So, it affected the Egyptians in the
                    pocketbook at least temporarily and some of them came home, lost their jobs in
                    the Gulf and elsewhere because of the boycott. But it was really more of a
                    political issue than an economic one after the initial shock of boycotting the
                    people and the products of Egypt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Camp David negotiations, including preparation, lasted
                        from when to when?</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>RUGH: I think Sadat went to Jerusalem in November 1977. It took about a year to
                    get to Camp David. It was in the fall of 1978 that we had Camp David. In that
                    year, we were not sure that it was going to move to that next step. We were
                    relieved that Camp David happened, that President Carter took the initiative to
                    invite them to Camp David to resolve the substantive issues. I am sure the
                    American role at Camp David was crucial. It wouldn't have happened without that.
                    But then after the Camp David Accords in the fall of 1978, it took another year
                    before the treaty was actually agreed upon. During this period, we were holding
                    our breath until the agreement was signed. But it was a relief to see the
                    agreement finally signed in 1979. That was a very positive step. In fact, it
                    really helped us a lot in our public affairs program, not only in Cairo, but
                    elsewhere in the region, because in spite of the criticism, the boycott, and the
                    internal opposition to it by some Egyptians, we were now able to say, “The
                    negotiation directly with Israel on substantive issues by an Arab state has led
                    to Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory.” That is what we had been arguing for
                    20 years. So, I felt that it was much easier to advocate American policy
                    positions on the peace process now that Sadat had taken that step. We pointed to
                    Sadat as an example of a successful approach to the problem in contrast to the
                    failure of the PLO to regain any Arab territory by its tactics. So, we made
                    those comparisons and argued for continued peaceful settlement. Not everybody
                    was convinced, but it helped us a lot in our ability to cite examples of what we
                    had been talking about for 20 years. That was the first time we had been able to
                    do that.</p>

                        Israel.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. I felt this was a real watershed in American public diplomacy for
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this public diplomacy field, did you have much
                        coordination, exchange of information, with our USIS Arab posts and with Tel
                        Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We did. We always communicated laterally on these questions, particularly
                    with the other posts in the other Arab countries. We met from time to time. We
                    had conferences almost annually of public affairs officers either in Washington
                    or in the field and talked about these issues. The chiefs of mission also had
                    meetings and discussed these issues. I think we all felt that Sadat's initiative
                    and President Carter's initiative at Camp David were very helpful to us.
                    Carter's initiative in bringing them together at Camp David showed that the
                    United States was proactive. The Arabs had been asking us to be proactive in an
                    unbiased way. While some of the Arabs that we talked to felt that Sadat had been
                    taken at Camp David and had not won enough concessions from the Israelis, there
                    were others who felt that the United States was at least making an effort. They
                    thought President Carter was reasonably evenhanded, a more or less honest
                    broker. It wasn't a universal Arab view, but there were enough people in the
                    Middle East that felt that we were at least trying in that respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find with this both in Egypt and hearing from your
                        colleagues in other Arab posts that there was more interest in the United
                        States and its policy since we really were getting in there and doing some
                        of the nitty gritty?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, there was. The Carter administration's focus on human rights also
                    played a role. Some Arabs began to think that perhaps the American President was
                    indeed interested in the rights of the Palestinians. I personally think he was.
                    This came across when he talked to Sadat. He developed a very warm relationship
                    with Sadat personally. That was clear to people in the Middle East. It depended
                    a little bit on what you thought of Sadat, but those who were at least
                    supportive of Sadat or open minded transferred to Jimmy Carter a positive
                    impression of American efforts in the Middle East. So, we were beginning to get
                    some positive responses on American proactive policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your reaction initially when the Camp David
                        Agreement became known? How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Relieved and pleased that an agreement had actually been achieved. I
                    assumed that since Sadat had agreed to it, he knew what he was doing and that
                    this was another helpful step that he was taking after his trip to Jerusalem. I
                    still feel that he did the right thing. He probably did make more concessions
                    than Begin in order to get it, but he had his eye on the goal of an agreement
                    and withdrawal. He was single minded and he ignored his advisors who recommended
                    against taking this course. We thought he was courageous and we applauded what
                    he was doing. We very much wanted to succeed and we saw him succeeding. We
                    thought that we ought to work on both of them to come together. There were some
                    exchanges between embassy Tel Aviv and embassy Damascus which were fairly
                    heated, partly because each one was headed by a very strong willed and
                    articulate ambassador explaining his host government's view. We thought that we
                    were focused on American interests and not on Arab interests and that we were
                    not being unnecessarily biased and that we were trying to encourage Washington
                    to be evenhanded and to understand where Syria was coming from. We weren't
                    taking Syria's side. There were a lot of things we objected to. Washington had a
                    misunderstanding of Syria, we thought. The Israelis said to Washington, “Syria
                    controls Lebanon and therefore anything that happens in Lebanon, talk to Syria
                    about it.” We thought that was an exaggeration. We felt Syria had enormous
                    influence in Lebanon, but they didn't control everything. This came up because
                    there were Americans who had been kidnapped in Lebanon and people in Israel and
                    Washington thought, “If Syria wanted to help us get them released, all they had
                    to do was snap its fingers and they would be released.” I was never sure how
                    much Sadat could do to get those hostages released. It may be that Syria had
                    more influence than we admitted, but I don't think it had as much influence as
                    the Israelis claimed.</p>

                    opposition in the Arab world would die down and that others would follow Egypt's
                    example, but we weren't at all sure that was going to happen. Egypt being the
                    largest and most powerful Arab state and a key to the Arab world, having made
                    this agreement that was the good news. The bad news was it didn't spread to
                    others. We had hoped that the Jordanians would follow suit and they didn't. We
                    were less optimistic that the Syrians would follow suit, but the Palestinians
                    didn't follow. There was a good chance the Jordanians would and they didn't do
                    so. We were disappointed in the Jordanians' position particularly because we
                    thought they were most likely to be the next one to follow. The Lebanese always
                    said that they would try to be second in line for a peaceful settlement with
                    Israel, but it turned out the Lebanese weren't free to do so because of Syrian
                    influence on Lebanon. They did try a little bit later in '82 and '83 to make a
                    deal with Israel, but that fell apart with Syrian opposition. We were pleased
                    that this step had been taken, but concerned that we needed another step and
                    that didn't really come at all for more than a decade. We were disappointed in
                    that and then of course by '79 the world was watching the events in Iran with
                    some concern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the seizure of our embassy and the
                        taking of hostages there and the overthrow of the Shah' and the Islamic
                        revolution there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, that had an impact in Egypt, as it did in the region in several ways
                    and most of them were of concern to us. One, it encouraged the Islamic groups in
                    Egypt. They saw a successful coup by an Islamic revolution (they call it), by an
                    Islamic fundamentalist group, not in an Arab country, but a nearby Islamic
                    country. This encouraged them to think it could happen anywhere, even in Egypt.
                    We saw an upsurge of support and enthusiasm for Islamic groups on the campuses
                    of universities in Egypt, more Islamic dress visible in the public, newspapers,
                    publications, organizations and that was of concern. We didn't expect that the
                    revolution would suddenly come to Egypt, but we were concerned that this model,
                    at least in the early months of the revolution, would be imitated, that the
                    people would try to imitate it. The other problem that it caused for us or the
                    other concern we had was that people said “The Shah was your friend; you let him
                    down and didn't help him.” If I remember correctly, the Shah came to Egypt when
                    he fled.</p>

                <p>RUGH: He came to Egypt for medical treatment, and then he came to the United
                    States. This had an effect in Egypt of reminding Egyptians of the American-Sadat
                    connection. Some Egyptians were critical of Sadat for making concessions to
                    Israel on Camp David, for being a capitalist, for supporting the private sector
                    in Egypt, for reversing the Nasserite socialist gains that they liked. In other
                    words, the left and the Arab nationalist element in Egypt were reinforced in
                    their criticism of the United States when the Shah came. They said that these
                    are two likeminded authoritarian rulers, who are in the pocket of the Americans
                    and that created a bit of a problem for us. Others who were more inclined to be
                    friendly to the United States said “is America going to let us down, as they let
                    the Shah down? And you did nothing to help. You had such a stake there and you
                    let it go down the drain and did nothing to help prevent the revolution in Iran.
                    Is America a loyal friend in the end?” That created doubt about American
                    reliability at the time and it wasn't helped when we had the hostage situation
                    in Tehran, when we had a rescue attempt that failed. It made us look weak and
                    that was a public affairs problem in Egypt and elsewhere in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Camp David, the Iranian Revolution and all, and
                        the fact that Israelis weren't terribly forthcoming, was this a let down for
                        all of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It was as time passed after the peace agreement. It was a let down for
                    those reasons and the Egypt public began to say “Where is the peace dividend?”
                    They felt Sadat had promised them a peace dividend in terms of economic
                    prosperity. Really, he never made extravagant promises, but they thought in his
                    defense of the Camp David agreements, that he at least implied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Although it was implicit. I mean, anybody would think that

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. If you look back at his speeches, he never promised them anything
                    specific, but everyone expected it would be a peace dividend and it wasn't
                    coming. The positive glow of the peace treaty began to dim and be diminished by
                    the persistent economic problems that Egypt had. The failure of other Arab
                    countries to follow suit on the peace process, the failure for the economic boom
                    to occur, the problems in Iran and the gulf changed the mood and became more
                    pessimistic as we got into 1980 and '81.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Next time we will pick it up then. Summer of '81, how did
                        you feel about the survivability of Sadat? And also how he was conducting
                        himself? Was he getting more authoritative, losing touch? How did you feel
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: When I left in the summer of '81, I thought that he was managing his
                    situation in Egypt very well and I thought he was on top of the situation. He
                    had made some moves in the direction of opening up the political system, as well
                    as the economy, and these were welcome to us as Americans. We thought that was
                    good that he allowed more press freedom and more parties to be created. He did
                    it from the top down. He created a new party out of his old party. He decreed
                    that parties could be formed. They weren't growing up organically and naturally,
                    but still, we thought this was a positive development. It turned out later, in
                    retrospect, that he let it get out of hand and he was assassinated. But that was
                    a story that happened after I left in '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Hosni Mubarak, who was his vice president
                        at the time? You already had Sadat, who had been a vice president, who was
                        considered a lightweight under Nasser. What about Mubarak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Same. We didn't know much about him. He was a military man and a pilot. He
                    was the hero of the October war and we didn't know much about him as a political
                    figure independent of Sadat. He was the number two and very much how Sadat had
                    been invisible or indistinguishable from Nasser. He wasn't prominent and he
                    didn't have a political base, but a military base and not a political base.
                    Sadat was calling the shots. Sadat was very much in charge and kept his own
                    counsel to a large extent. He accepted or rejected his advisors' advice as he
                    thought best. He made his own decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you reserve some admirations for you being in the
                        public affairs business on how Sadat, I am told he was excellent in treating
                        foreign visitors and make them feel welcome at home and sit down. He seemed
                        to be superb at this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, He was terrific at this. We had a number of occasions to see him in
                    action because various high level visits. Jimmy Carter came a number of times,
                    when I was there. Between the time of the Jerusalem visit in the fall of '77 and
                    Camp David in the fall of '78 and the peace treaty, Carter came many times.
                    Cyrus Vance came many times and with them a whole press contingent. Sadat would
                    meet the press, talk to them, and do it extremely well. He was very effective in
                    talking to Israeli journalists, American journalists, and Western journalists.
                    There were Egyptian and Arab journalists who were less convinced and some of
                    them had felt that he had become an American. That he had sold-out to the
                    Israelis and Americans, and they were often critical of him more than the
                    American journalists. But he was single-minded in this pursuit of an agreement
                    with Israel and a better relationship with the United States and didn't try to
                    be all things to all people. He didn't make a big effort to mend fences with the
                    Arabs and he didn't make a big effort to play the opposition within Egypt
                    because it was a minority opposition. He didn't feel he needed to do so.</p>

                        were you doing in Damascus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was Deputy Chief of Mission. First, Under Ambassador Talcott Seelye whom
                    I had known in Jeddah, when he was DCM much earlier.</p>

                <p>RUGH: I was there from '81 to '84 as a DCM. It was a three year assignment. When
                    I arrived, Seelye had decided to retire from the Foreign Service and he and I
                    overlapped for I think two weeks. Then the new Ambassador Bob Paganelli came
                    after that. I really served under Bob Paganelli for most of the term.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two Ambassadors who are known for having very strong
                        opinion. Could you describe what the situation was in Syria in '81, when you
                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>RUGH: Relations were difficult between the United States and Syria, primarily,
                    over Israel and the peace process. And even over Lebanon, which of course is
                    related to the peace process. We re-established relations under Ambassador
                    Murphy. The time after the Camp David, when we were not there at all, was an
                    even more difficult time. It was tough working that account because the Syrians
                    had grievances against us and we had so many grievances against the Syrians.
                    Primarily, relating to the peace process in Lebanon, our positions were far
                    apart and the Congress was very critical of Syrian behavior as was the US
                    administration. These difficulties led during my time there to the Congress
                    canceling the AID program. We had an AID program, a very large one, with about
                    300 million dollars in the pipeline for Syria. The Congress decided to cancel
                    that and take the money back. Which is a little unusual, but they were so upset
                    with the Syrian government that they did that.</p>

                <p>RUGH: No, this happened during my time but it was symptomatic. When I arrived,
                    there was a lot of tension. And the decision by Congress to take the money back
                    was symptomatic of that tension, which only increased during my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the tension when you were there? You could talk
                        about the tensions on both sides.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>RUGH: The United States felt that Syria should have, in its own interest, the
                    region's interest, and the interest of the United States, been more interested
                    in the peace process. The United States also felt that Syria was to some extent
                    being an obstacle to the settlement of the Lebanese security and internal
                    situation because Syria had a very heavy military presence in eastern Lebanon
                    and a lot of political influence over the Lebanese. The Syrians, for their part,
                    felt that it was not our business what they were doing in Lebanon. They said
                    that Lebanon and Syria were so close that they didn't even need embassies in
                    each other's capitals because they were not one country but practically one
                    country. This led many people in the United States to think that Syria wanted to
                    annex Lebanon. The issue with Lebanon was a contentious point. But, the main
                    issue was Israel and the Palestinians and the peace process, which had not made
                    any progress after Camp David. Only Egypt had made peace with Israel at that
                    point. The Camp David Israeli and Egyptian peace was very new and at that point
                    Egypt was still isolated from the rest of the Arab world, with Syria taking the
                    leading role to isolate Egypt. We were very gratified by the role Egypt had
                    played in the peace process. We were very pleased that Egypt had made peace with
                    Israel, which we felt was in the interest of Israel, Egypt, and the Arabs. But
                    the Syrians took a very different view and thought that peace with Israel was
                    treason and wouldn't agree with any of our arguments to them that this was the
                    way to go. That you would settle the Israel-Arab conflict fairly and with
                    justice if you negotiate directly. They objected to that idea. At the time, it
                    was my view, which has turned out to be incorrect, that Syria was able to take
                    this hard line position on Israel because only Egypt had agreed to negotiate
                    with Israel. I thought that if only other Arab entities, for example Jordon or
                    the Palestinians, or both joined the peace process, that would isolate Syria;
                    and Syrians being practical people over history, seeing the historical trends,
                    would also join the peace process. So, when I was asked by Washington, what do I
                    think of Syria joining the peace process? I said, “As long as the PLO refuses to
                    negotiate with Israel, its going to be almost impossible for the Syrians to do
                    the same. But, once the PLO and the Israeli get together and negotiate then
                    Assad would follow too.” It turned out I was wrong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must be a lot of pressure on the embassy because
                        there was a saying “there can be no war without Egypt and no peace without
                        Syria.” There wasn't going to be a war but there wasn't going to be peace.
                        What were you getting about Assad when you went there? What made him tick?
                        What was his source of strength?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>RUGH: It seemed that he was convinced that being a very strong, tough Arab
                    nationalist was important to him and maintaining his power. He represented
                    internally a minority group. The Alawites were in the minority. He had come up
                    through the military. His hold on power depended partly on the control of the
                    military and control of the Syrian Baath party. It was to some extent, tenuous
                    if you consider that he was representing a minority and that may have influenced
                    his desire to preserve himself as a very tough Arab nationalist. He was tough.
                    He would talk about refusal to surrender, as he thought Sadat surrendered to the
                    Israelis. But he was going to insist on no surrender. His control was fairly
                    solid. When I first arrived in 1981, there was some terrorist activity going on
                    in Syria carried out by Islamic fundamentalists against the regime. During the
                    first several months there were a few major car bomb explosions in Damascus and
                    elsewhere. One of them was right behind the American school and caused a lot of
                    damage to the air force headquarters as I recall. In the first months I was
                    there, the Syrian government was able to put an end to that. They were able to
                    arrest and eliminate the opposition. It was fairly stable. The only exception
                    being later when there was an uprising in Hama. It took a couple days for the
                    Syrian army to put it down and they put it down very brutally, destroying a
                    large section of Hama. The press said they destroyed the whole city, which of
                    course wasn't true. They did destroy a large section of it and it happened when
                    I was there.</p>

                <p>RUGH: I thought it was an advantage or tool that the Egyptians had made peace
                    with Israel compared to five years earlier when no Arab state had made peace
                    with Israel. This was an advantage. We could point to the fact that Egypt had
                    regained his territory by negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is often forgotten when we talk about this.
                        This isn't just Egypt acknowledging Israel's presence, they got territory

                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>RUGH: The Syrians of course brush that aside. They just countered it and said it
                    didn't matter. It was treason and the Arab world had rejected it. But I think it
                    did help us. It was an arrow in our quiver. We also thought, perhaps mistakenly,
                    that we had a large AID program, a large economic assistance program. We thought
                    that was an interesting carrot for the Syrians. It turned out once we limited it
                    that Assad didn't flinch. He didn't care. (Laughter) But, at the time, we hoped
                    that that Egyptian position, American interest there, American assistance,
                    alleged Syrian desire to have better relations with us would be leverage. The
                    Soviet Union had very close relations with Syria to the extent that the American
                    Embassy was excluded from any contact with the military. The military was
                    entirely supplied with Soviet military equipment, advisors, training, and so on.
                    We saw convoys of Soviet military equipment run by the Syrian Army going through
                    Damascus all the time and our defense attach� was on the road, chasing after it,
                    trying to count things and figure out what they had. A lot of the movement was
                    related to Lebanon because the Syrian army had a huge presence in eastern
                    Lebanon. We also had no real access to the party, Assad's party. But the
                    Soviet's did and it was difficult for us to do any culture activities or any
                    normal exchange activities with the Syrians to an extent they wanted to show
                    their friendship with the Russians/Soviets and not to us.</p>
                <p>In '81 when I arrived, it was still reasonable relations between Syria and Iraq.
                    They were both controlled by Baath regimes, Baath party. And the terminology
                    they used was that the Baath party was an Arab National Regional party. One
                    branch of it ruled Baghdad and one branch ruled Damascus. So, there was a
                    theoretical brotherhood there. But underneath that rhetoric was a lot of
                    suspicion between Baghdad and Damascus and it grew during my time there to the
                    point that there was an enormous amount of tension. And the border was closed
                    between Iraq and Syria and the pipeline which crossed Syria to Iraq to the
                    Mediterranean was shut down by the Syrians. The hostility was very public. The
                    tension underneath the rhetoric only grew.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about fundamentalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That grew as an issue during my time there. When I first arrived it wasn't
                    a major issue there. But it grew for an interesting reason and as the tension
                    increased between Iraq and Syria, Syria became closer to Iran, during the
                    Iran-Iraq war. The Iranians were interested in Syrian support, but they were
                    also interested in other things. There are Shiite shrines in Damascus and they
                    began sending martyrs, that is wives and children of Iranians who had been
                    killed in Iraq. Damascus started to fill up with a steady flow of Iranians, who
                    were very angry at Iraq and also not happy with the United States. This became a
                    very interesting security issue for us because there were Shiite areas in town
                    that were full of angry Iranians.</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>RUGH: The initial impression we had of the Reagan Administration, as I recall,
                    was very encouraging. The Reagan administration wanted to solve the Arab-Israeli
                    conflict. They were going to be proactive and even handed. Both of which the
                    professional diplomats wanted to see. After an initial meeting, we all thought
                    this was great. He is a reasonable man, sensible, and he is going to have a good
                    policy on the Middle East. In fact, if I recall correctly, he developed for the
                    Reagan administration the Reagan plan for the peace process, which had excellent
                    elements in it. We were optimistic in the beginning. The trouble was he tried to
                    divide up the issue into pieces and deal with them one at a time. He decided
                    that the first piece ought to be with Israel and Lebanon because he heard the
                    Israelis say that they would like to strike a deal with Lebanon and Lebanese say
                    things that lead him to believe there was a possibility of a peace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I think it was not coming from Reagan. I think it was coming from his
                    appointees, primarily Shultz. In the beginning Haig, then Shultz. Shultz and
                    Weinberger in particular. They were focused on peace and expanding the peace
                    from Egypt into the rest of the Arab world. They were starting with Lebanon and
                    Israel and at the time they thought this was a terrific idea. It turned out to
                    be a failure. And we were watching from the sidelines and hearing from Syrians
                    some misgivings that this was going on because Syrians have a very strong
                    interest in Lebanon and weren't to happy to see Lebanon negotiate with Israel.
                    They regarded this whole process as a Christian-Lebanese sell out to the
                    Israelis at the expense on Muslim Lebanese and the rest of the Arab world. We
                    tried to convey that to Washington. That Syria is not happy with what is going
                    on and was not going to go along with it. Washington chose to move ahead and
                    ignore Syria, while they tried to put together the Lebanon-Israel agreement. It
                    wasn't until, I believe, '83 that Washington turned its attention to Syria and
                    that was after an agreement was signed between Israel and Lebanon. Secretary
                    Shultz came to Damascus in March or April of '83, for his first ever meeting
                    with Assad. He had in his pocket the Israel-Lebanon agreement that had been
                    signed - without Syrian involvement. He assumed since he had this agreement that
                    all he had to do was to get Assad to bless it and move on to the next step,
                    which would be a Syria-Israeli agreement. He, in fact, had heard from Ambassador
                    Paganelli in the reporting from Damascus to Washington that the Syrians were
                    very unhappy with this whole process and he saw Ambassador Paganelli at a Cairo
                    conference. Paganelli told him at the Chief of Missions Conference that the
                    Syrians won't go along with this.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Paganelli is a man that talks straight and is a very dedicated public servant and
                    wanted to convey to the boss exactly what the situation was. The Secretary of
                    State misunderstood what he was hearing in two ways. One, he thought Assad's
                    opposition to the peace process was exaggerated and, two, he thought Paganelli
                    was taking the Syrian side, maybe even being disloyal. That was maybe in March
                    of '83, if I remember the dates correctly. Then, shortly thereafter, Shultz came
                    to Damascus to have his first face to face meeting with Hafez Al-Assad and he
                    spent about four hours listening to Assad. At the end of the meeting, he
                    realized, I think, that what he had been hearing from Paganelli was a shorter
                    version of what Assad was saying and Paganelli wasn't making it up. He hadn't
                    gone native and he hadn't become more Arab than the Arabs. In fact, he was
                    faithfully reporting Assad's hostility to the Lebanon-Israeli Agreement and to
                    the whole peace process. And Shultz began to realize that it wasn't going to be
                    easy to sell this to Assad. So, in retrospect, Shultz made a tactical mistake in
                    taking Syria for granted. I think he realized it wasn't going be so easy. I was
                    posted in Damascus while this was happening and felt that he got very
                    discouraged about the peace process and walked away from it after running into a
                    wall in Damascus with Assad.</p>
                <p>I think, in retrospect that we should have tried to work with Syria directly
                    instead of this whole deal with Lebanon. But, the chances were slim because
                    Assad didn't feel it was a necessity to making a deal or allowing a deal to go
                    through. And repeatedly said that the Palestinians reject...</p>
                <p>We should abstain relationship with the PLO, because of our relationship with
                    Israel. But I thought it was not in the U.S. interest to repeat a deal with the
                    PLO.</p>
                <p>I remember, Terry Anderson, as an AP reporter, came over from Beirut and talked
                    to us several times about this issue. He said, “Can't the Syrians bring about
                    the release of the hostages?” I told him, we don't know how much influence they
                    have. We are asking the Syrians to be helpful. We have asked them repeatedly to
                    help us find and release these Americans, who are in the hands of the Hezbollah
                    and friends of Iran and now that Iran and Syria have good relations, Syria ought
                    to be influential. We said this is inhumanitarian and these are innocent
                    victims. Think of that aspect and their families and so on. But it didn't
                    produce much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Terry Anderson was the Associated Press bureau chief in Beirut at the time.
                    This was before he was kidnapped in 1985.</p>

                        Syria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>RUGH: Talcott Seelye was one of the great Arabists and one of the great
                    professionals in the Foreign Service. I had always admired him. He knew as much
                    about the Middle East as anybody in the Foreign Service. He had grown up in
                    Beirut, spoke fluent Arabic, talked to President Hafez El Assad in Arabic,
                    presented his credentials in Arabic. He had been born in Beirut. He privately
                    was very concerned about American policy toward the peace process and felt that
                    we were not always evenhanded, that we had not always appreciated Arab concerns.
                    But he was a very loyal American who carried out American policy brilliantly and
                    was very careful not to let his personal views distort his performance as an
                    American ambassador, an American official. Privately, he was often critical of
                    what we were doing.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I arrived in Damascus, Seelye was scheduled to leave Syria and
                    retire. He planned to take a few days of leave in Europe and then go back to
                    Washington. He had had a very long and distinguished career. So, he was thinking
                    about the end of his career. He invited two American reporters who happened to
                    be in Damascus, The New York Times and one other newspaper to interview him as
                    he left. He was scheduled to leave in the afternoon or evening and agreed to
                    have the interview in the morning. The night before, he said to me that he was
                    thinking about expressing some of his personal views to them because he was
                    about to retire and would be a private citizen and what did I think? Should he
                    do that? I knew what he meant generally speaking. I didn't know specifically. I
                    said I thought he ought to make that decision himself, but if he felt strongly
                    about it, he should express his views. He had an opportunity to be helpful and
                    if he felt it was in the U.S. interests that he speak out, he should do so.
                    Well, he did. As I recall, the question he was asked was, “Mr. Ambassador, what
                    do you think about relations between the PLO and the United States? How should
                    America deal with the PLO?” His answer was something like, “I think we should
                    pick up the phone and call them.” They said something like, “Well, this is off
                    the record, isn't it?” He said, “No, you can print it.” They checked again with
                    him to make sure they could quote him as the sitting American ambassador and he
                    said, “Yes.” That made headlines: “American official says we should talk to
                    PLO.” It hit the fan in Washington. Washington was unhappy, to say the least,
                    that he had said that. But by the time he got back to Washington, it had blown
                    over. There were a few people that were still grumbling, but it was something
                    that he had always said privately and a lot of us had thought and said
                    privately. I think the career people who worked in the Near East area
                    appreciated what he said. Some of them who were in Washington who took the blame
                    for supposedly allowing this ambassador to speak out were not happy.</p>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>RUGH: No, we didn't anticipate it. It was a surprise to us, to the Syrians as
                    well. It was a major event and a major problem for us, as well as for the
                    Syrians. It helped cause a deterioration in American Syrian relations for a
                    number of reasons, including the Israeli occupation of Beirut and southern
                    Lebanon in the spring and summer of 1982. The United States had an expanded
                    military presence in the area, including flying reconnaissance flights over
                    Lebanon. One of those reconnaissance planes was shot down by the Syrians. One of
                    the pilots was killed. The other pilot, Lieutenant Goodman, was captured and
                    brought to Damascus. The Syrians had an American military officer in their
                    custody. This was a problem. We immediately asked for his release and they held
                    onto him for a number of weeks, through Christmas. The ambassador had access to
                    him and visited him a number of times, took messages from his family, and we
                    requested his release and they refused. Jesse Jackson, a prominent
                    African-American figure, came to Damascus on a special mission with his Rainbow
                    Coalition, a group of political and other community leaders, to help get
                    Lieutenant Goodman released. Jackson conferred with us at the embassy and then
                    went and talked to Assad a couple of times. The upshot was that Lieutenant
                    Goodman was released. The Syrians did the release in an interesting way. One
                    morning, the Foreign Ministry asked the ambassador to come by at 9 o'clock. We
                    went over and the Foreign Minister said, “At 11 o'clock, we're going to release
                    Lieutenant Goodman to you and Jesse Jackson together. Be here at 11.” At 10
                    o'clock, they called Jackson and told him the same thing. So, at 11 o'clock, we
                    showed up. Lieutenant Goodman was at the Foreign Ministry and was handed over to
                    the joint custody of the American ambassador and Jesse Jackson. Then they went
                    down to the hotel and had a joint press conference, which was really mostly
                    Jackson talking. We thought that was interesting because I think Jackson's
                    presence helped give them an excuse to release Goodman. They didn't want to turn
                    him over to the American government. That galled them. But Jackson, emphasizing
                    the humanitarian aspect and as a private citizen, it made it easier for them.
                    But they didn't want to go so far as to turn him over only to Jackson. They
                    wanted to give him to us, too. So, they sort of got the best of both worlds.

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Initially, we were hopeful that he would be able to solve the problem. We
                    didn't care who solved it. We just wanted it solved. Until he was released, we
                    weren't sure they were going to release him. Jesse Jackson brought somebody with
                    him in his Rainbow Coalition named Louis Farrakhan, who was very quiet and just
                    observed, but he was part of the team.</p>

                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>RUGH: We did, but we didn't target Syrian positions. The battleship was firing16
                    inch shells whose accuracy is not precise into Lebanon. They were landing in the
                    villages and in the hills, causing craters in empty fields and in other places.
                    I think there was some Syrian damage, but there wasn't any direct fighting
                    between American and Syrian military, except for this one incident where they
                    shot Goodman's plane down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the whole involvement in Lebanon, were we sending
                        messages to Israel saying, “Don't get yourself involved with the
                        Syrians”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. A major initiative on our part was to try to help the Israelis and
                    Syrians communicate with each other about where they were, where they would go,
                    what they would do to avoid a military conflict. We would ask the Syrians what
                    their intentions were and ask the Israelis what their intentions were, where
                    they were, what they were going to do, and where their lines were. I think we
                    helped the communication process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: There were messages from Washington instructing us to “Pass the following
                    message to the Syrians that the Israelis have said to us.” During those days, we
                    were basically working 24 hours a day. We were all night and all day at the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>We were concerned that it was out of control, that we weren't getting the whole
                    story. It was a very unpredictable situation. We didn't know where the Israelis
                    were going to go. We originally thought they were just going to make an
                    incursion into southern Lebanon, where they already had a presence, and then
                    they went beyond that and went all the way to Beirut and surrounded Beirut. That
                    was a surprise and a concern. How far are they going to go? If they keep going
                    and if they push into eastern Lebanon, they're going to have a direct conflict
                    with the Syrians. What would the Russians do?</p>
                <p>My understanding was that there was also a conversation between Washington and
                    Moscow and Moscow was involved and embarrassed that the Syrians were put in this
                    tight position being threatened by Israel inside of Lebanon, which had been
                    Syrian turf. The Israelis had not had a presence in this Arab country except in
                    the very south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't Syria have a presence in Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, but we did not know much about what they were doing inside of Lebanon,
                    but we could watch them a little bit better inside of Syria. They had the
                    surface-to-air missile. I think it was a SAM V, which had the capability of
                    reaching into the Mediterranean where we were flying our aircraft. So, we were
                    not relaxed about the possibility that the Syrians would not only go against
                    Israel, but would go against American forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from the Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We were getting a lot of anger and a lot of accusations that the United
                    States was behind this and was not only allowing it, but encouraging Israeli
                    action, that the United States was ignoring the innocent Lebanese civilian
                    victims, and that we were revealed as being totally biased because we didn't
                    stop the Israelis. The Syrians assumed that we could have stopped the Israelis
                    if we had wanted to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Syrians saying, “Do something about this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Well, it wasn't quite in that vein. We took most of the initiatives in
                    discussing the question. But whenever we raised issues and expressed our concern
                    about the escalation that was taking place and the possible further escalation
                    of the violence that would bring Israel and Syria into direct confrontation,
                    they would very strongly reject our approach. They would say, “Israel invaded.
                    Tell your friends in Israel to leave.” It was pretty simple from their point of
                    view. They were saying to us on a daily basis, “It's Israel's fault and it's
                    your fault. Get out of there.” But most of the conversations really were
                    initiated by us. They weren't coming to us screaming about the danger. They took
                    a posture of saying “Lebanon invited us, that's why we're there. Nobody invited
                    Israel in. They invaded unilaterally. The problem is yours to resolve. You
                    Americans and Israelis get out of there.” That was the nature of the
                    discussion.</p>
                <p>The Syrians would say, “We're not Lebanon. If you want to talk about Lebanon,
                    talk to the Lebanese.” We thought that was a little bit disingenuous because we
                    thought they had a lot of influence. But we did talk to Lebanese parties. A
                    number of Lebanese officials came to Damascus on a regular basis to talk to the
                    Syrians and we talked to them as well. It was primarily the job of our embassy
                    in Beirut to do, but we also supported them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much interaction between our embassies in Beirut
                        and Damascus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: To some extent, members of the embassy staff and families came over to
                    Damascus from Beirut because Beirut was really in a war zone and Damascus was
                    very quiet. So, it was sort of an R&amp;R.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about kidnapping in Lebanon of Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The Syrians really didn't comment. The issue was who did it. Because of
                    American suspicions about and hostility to Syria and Israeli hostility to Syria,
                    the immediate suspicion was that Syria was behind all of this. We felt that it
                    was possible that Syria was involved, but we needed to look at it more carefully
                    to see if we could figure out whether that was true or not. So, there were
                    discussions between our embassy in Damascus and Washington and our embassy in
                    Tel Aviv over responsibility for terrorism. This was a very common, repeated
                    theme. Our embassy in Damascus took the position that Syria might have been
                    involved, but let's look at it more carefully, not just assume that all the bad
                    things that happened in Lebanon had a Syrian hand. There were a lot of bad
                    people who weren't Syrian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling of why the US sent troops back in
                        the second time around? It did seem like the mission was never
                        questioned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: To be honest, I don't think we sounded the alarm and expressed our strong
                    reservations about this move. I think we tended to assume that Washington knew
                    what it was doing. It turned out that wasn't the case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you reporting and what were you finding out? You
                        think of Syria and Assad. How did this play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>RUGH: We heard about the Hama siege when it started. We tried to monitor it, but
                    it was difficult because it was closed off by the Syrians. They didn't allow our
                    attach�s or anybody to go up there and look at it. But we did get some people up
                    there and looked at it while it was still going on. This was before the
                    international press knew it was happening. There were lots of American and
                    foreign journalists sitting in Beirut, but there weren't any correspondents
                    sitting in Damascus. The Syrians weren't about to report it. So, it didn't get
                    into the international press until after it was just about over. But the embassy
                    knew about it and was reporting on it. What happened was that Hama is a very old
                    city and the oldest parts of it have very narrow streets and it's sort of a
                    rabbit warren of little narrow alleys and houses piled on top of each other. The
                    Islamic fundamentalists who were in revolt against the local government of Hama
                    were able to resist being arrested by the local police and military because they
                    holed up in these small houses and streets. That was a security problem for the
                    Syrians because they couldn't get them out of there. It was easier to be snipers
                    in a window of a little old house than it was to arrest them, kill them. So the
                    army surrounded the city and they tried to root them out. After a few days, they
                    realized that they were failing to do so, so they began to bombard this
                    particular residential section of the city which had the resisting Islamic
                    fundamentalists in it. They pretty much leveled one section of town. It was a
                    district of the city that they destroyed. It was all over. Then the press came
                    in and discovered it and said that they had destroyed a whole town.</p>
                <p>One aspect of it that was important was that during the cleanup of the city after
                    the rebellion was put down, the Syrians discovered quite a few weapons that had
                    been supplied by Iraq. Assad told us that. That really caused a major
                    deterioration in Iraqi-Syrian relations. This really was something that Assad
                    could not tolerate. He didn't trust the Iraqis. To see them supply an
                    insurrection inside Syria was just more than he could stand. Since that time, he
                    has been very hostile to Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Assad? Visits to Syria are sort of obligatory
                        for justifiable reasons by US officials, no? Was there an acceptance of
                        people coming from the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>RUGH: There was. There weren't as many visits to Syria as there were to Israel
                    and even Cairo, but there were some. We had a few congressional delegations.
                    John Tower, Senator from Texas, came, as did John Warner from Virginia, who was
                    on the Arms Services Committee. He welcomed those. He liked to have a chance to
                    talk to American congressman. But it was mostly from our side. We had some
                    American officials come. Shultz came a few times. They got a chance to talk
                    directly to Syrians and understood Syria a lot better after they visited Syria.
                    Assad spent a lot of time explaining the roots of his grievances. One issue that
                    was important to Washington and with the Syrians and especially with Congress
                    was the question of Syrian Jews. The Syrian Jewish community was of great
                    interest to many members of Congress. I discovered very quickly that it's a
                    small community. There are fewer Jews in Syria than there are in Brooklyn, but
                    the Syrian Jewish community had the ability to communicate with the Syrian
                    Jewish community in the United States. Whenever there was an incident involving
                    a Syrian Jewish person, we would find out about it through Washington. The State
                    Department would say, “Congressman so and so has just told us that yesterday a
                    Syrian Jew was beaten up in the souk in Aleppo. What do you know about it? We
                    didn't know anything about it.” We had to go find out. So, we would contact the
                    head of the Syrian Jewish community and say, “Is this true?” The Congressmen
                    wanted us to go and see Assad and tell him to stop harassing Jews. But first we
                    wanted to find out what the Jewish community in Syria would say about it. Often,
                    it was a wildly exaggerated story. Sometimes it was true. If it was true, we
                    would raise the issue with the Syrian government. That was an issue that we were
                    instructed many times to raise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the interviews I'm doing right now is with Stephen
                        Solarz, who talks about getting a bunch of Syrian Jewish women out of Syria
                        to get married.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right, he did that before I was there. By that time, he was not allowed to
                    come to Syria by the Syrians. He tried several times to follow up on that
                    effort, but the Syrians didn't want him to come. Before I arrived, he had made a
                    visit and he had said some things which they felt were insulting and uncalled
                    for and they didn't grant him a visa after that. So, I never saw him in
                    Damascus.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Damascus in 1984. You went to Yemen as

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>RUGH: I was DCM in Damascus under Ambassador Robert Paganelli. He encouraged me
                    to think about another State Department assignment. As a USIA officer, I didn't
                    necessarily have all of the connections and supporters that a State Department
                    officer might have in that. You don't apply for an ambassadorship, but Paganelli
                    recommended me for an ambassadorship. The circumstances were that several people
                    who knew my work were in Washington and other places at the time and also made
                    phone calls in support of my candidacy. I think I was competitive largely
                    because of the luck of circumstances and having supporters like Paganelli,
                    Herman Eilts, and Talcott Seelye who knew me, and also because I had Arabic. I
                    think that helped.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: So, I was nominated, got the appointment, got a phone call from President
                    Reagan in Damascus asking me if I would accept the appointment, which, of
                    course, I did. In the fall of 1984, I went off to Sanaa, Yemen after going
                    through the nomination, clearance, and senatorial confirmation process.</p>

                        mafia that would stand in your way? Were USIA officers somewhat outside the

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I don't think there was an active conspiracy against us, but it was just
                    assumed by many people that ambassadorships go to State Department officers.
                    There were exceptions to that rule. Other USIA officers had gotten
                    ambassadorships before, but not many. Some of my colleagues in USIA were not
                    interested in being ambassador. One assumed that a State Department political
                    officer's goal was to become ambassador someday. Very often, the choice for
                    ambassador is made out of the ranks of the political officers in the State
                    Department. It is very competitive, but there is a lot of luck involved. I was

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem with confirmation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>RUGH: No substantive problem. There was a delay, as there has been in recent
                    years for many of these appointments. I received my phone call from President
                    Reagan in March of 1984 and I didn't get out to post until September or early
                    October of 1984. I didn't mind having some time off for holiday, but I was
                    anxious to get to post. The delay was simply the Senate getting around to
                    dealing with a group of us who came up. The confirmation hearing was fairly
                    straightforward. There were only two or three senators in attendance. They were
                    as interested in my view of Syria as they were in Yemen, or maybe more so. Syria
                    was a more contentious relationship, so they asked me about that assignment
                    rather than what I expected to find in Yemen. But there were a few questions on
                    Yemen. It went very quickly and there was no problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out, what were you getting from the desk
                        and from the bureau about Yemen and our interests there? Did you carry
                        anything as you went out there saying “This is something I want to get
                        done?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. The situation at the time was that Yemen was still a divided country.
                    North and South were separate. North Yemen, to which I was being accredited, was
                    a country that was more or less non aligned in the sense that North Yemen had
                    relations with the United States, with the Soviet Union, with China, with the
                    Gulf states, with Asia, with any country that would provide assistance to Yemen
                    or any country that would support Yemen's independence and sovereignty. South
                    Yemen, where we had no diplomatic relations, was a country that we regarded as a
                    Marxist state in the pocket of the Soviet Union. At the time, it was the state
                    that was the most hostile to the United States politically. It was not a
                    terribly important state, but its political coloration marked it as a country
                    that was a threat to American interests. So, I was being accredited to North
                    Yemen right next door to a country that was seen as an outpost of the Soviet
                    Union. This was still Cold War times. So, the background music of the assignment
                    was work closely with North Yemen, strengthen American-North Yemeni ties, and
                    keep an eye on South Yemen, which we regarded as a threat not only to the United
                    States, but to our friends in the region, including the Saudis. The Saudis were
                    very concerned about South Yemen. South Yemen, for example, maintained training
                    camps for terrorists of various kinds, including Palestinian terrorists who were
                    sent north after receiving training. We regarded this as a threat to our friends
                    in the region and ultimately a threat to the United States. So, we were watching
                    that very carefully. The relationship between North and South Yemen we knew was
                    a tense one. North Yemen was not really in the American camp and didn't have a
                    pro-American regime the way some others in the region did (Saudi Arabia, for
                    example), but it was not aligned with the Soviet Union. The Department of State
                    regarded it as important to help keep the North Yemenis cooperating with us and
                    working also with their neighbors. Another factor in this mix was our very
                    strong relationship with Saudi Arabia, the largest and wealthiest and most
                    powerful on the Arabian Peninsula, and a country which on the surface had
                    cordial relations with Yemen, but underneath there was always a certain amount
                    of tension between Saudi Arabia and North Yemen. Since Saudi Arabia was
                    considered as more important to the United States, that put Yemen in an
                    interesting position. That is to say, we had good relations with North Yemen,
                    but we had even better relations with the Saudis. It was in our interest to
                    maintain cordial relations between those two countries. We wanted good relations
                    with both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the thinking of why you had South Yemen turn so
                        radical? It was from the very beginning when it was revolting in Aden
                        against the British and all that. But not only was it radical, but it seemed
                        to be much more Soviet radical than anywhere else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. I guess our analysis was fairly simple. The regime in Yemen was an
                    Arab nationalist regime which had thrown the British out and then continued on
                    the path of hostility to foreign intervention and was persuaded by Moscow that
                    the Soviets could help them in maintaining their independence. The Soviets
                    invested in South Yemen by providing military assistance in the form of military
                    equipment and in providing military advisors in return for military access. So,
                    the Soviets over the years after the expulsion of the British in the mid-1960
                    developed a very close relationship with South Yemen playing on Arab nationalism
                    and hostility to British colonialism. There was some self interest on the part
                    of the South Yemeni leaders who profited from the relationship with the Soviet
                    Union and as a poor country found it helpful to be hostile to the West in order
                    to get Soviet assistance. I guess we didn't realize at the time (Certainly I
                    didn't, even sitting in Sanaa.) how one sided the Soviet relationship was. That
                    is to say, it was entirely military and political, but not economic. The Soviets
                    did not invest in the economic development of South Yemen. I visited South Yemen
                    later, just a couple of years ago. It was pretty clear from spending a week
                    there that the Soviets in their long association in South Yemen between the
                    mid-1960s and the late 1980s had not built South Yemeni infrastructure, had not
                    invested in anything except the military. They had given or sold the latest
                    military equipment to the South Yemenis and trained their military so that this
                    tiny country had for its size a fairly respectable military force, but the
                    economic infrastructure wasn't there. The Soviets had simply exploited it as a
                    military base. Their presence was fairly substantial. They had Soviet military
                    advisors, aircraft, listening posts, and monitoring facilities in the country as
                    their quid pro quo for providing military assistance. I had assumed sitting in
                    Sanaa when I got there that the Soviets were also providing them with economic
                    assistance. The propaganda coming out of the South was that this was a wonderful
                    economic and social experiment in modernization and socialist revolution, but
                    that was all propaganda. There wasn't anything there except a military
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have anybody there using a third power? Were there
                        any relations with South Yemen that we could get reports from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. The British were there, curiously, having been thrown out originally
                    and being the target of South Yemeni nationalist sentiment and anti-imperialist
                    hostility. The British were originally thrown out. Then they were allowed back
                    in and we were thrown out. This all happened in the 1960s. We never were allowed
                    back in. The British had a fairly modest presence. They weren't on terribly good
                    terms with the South Yemeni government. The French and Italians were there also.
                    None of the Western ambassadors were favored clients. The Soviets were. But they
                    did have a presence and from that presence they were able to observe a good deal
                    of what went on and they shared a lot of that with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just by being in North Yemen rather than South Yemen, did
                        you have any residual responsibility for South Yemen at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>RUGH: Not officially in terms of running a consular district or anything. There
                    weren't any Americans, as far as we knew, in South Yemen. But we had a watching
                    brief. That is to say, we were the only embassy that was supposed to be doing
                    something to keep track of what was going on in South Yemen. It was a natural
                    because the North Yemenis were watching South Yemen very closely. We shared some
                    information with the North Yemeni government from time to time on what was going
                    on in the South. They asked us questions, assuming that we, being a superpower,
                    knew what was going on there, and we asked them questions. They, in fact, had
                    quite a bit of human intelligence because they were able to go fairly easily
                    into the South and send people fairly easily into the South. They didn't share
                    it all with us, but they had some very interesting political information that
                    they shared with us. So, we learned from them a type of information that we
                    didn't learn from the British and French and vice versa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in North Yemen from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I was there from the fall of 1984 until July of 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe when you arrived there how you found
                        Yemen, both government, economy, and living conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yemen is a very traditional country, poor, has not had the oil wealth that
                    all of the other states of the Arabian Peninsula have had. It has the largest
                    population of any country on the Arabian Peninsula. At the time, it was about
                    seven million people, more than Saudi Arabia or any other country. The oil that
                    that had been discovered in 1984 was limited. That oil wealth didn't go around
                    very far. A major source of wealth was remittances from Yemeni workers in Saudi
                    Arabia and the Gulf states. So, it was a country that was dependent on its
                    remittances, on the labor of its labor force, and to a very large extent on
                    foreign assistance. At that time, in 1984, Yemen was receiving about $300
                    million a year from Saudi Arabia as a subsidy. It was receiving economic
                    assistance from the United States in an AID program, a strictly economic one,
                    not a military one. It was receiving military assistance from the Soviet Union.
                    It was receiving subsidies for its university and other facilities from the
                    Kuwaitis. The UAE built the dam in Marib, which was at the site of the ancient
                    dam in that eastern part of the country. Most of the states of the Arabian
                    Peninsula were given subsidies, including Iraq. The Chinese were there. They had
                    been there for a long time. The Chinese had built one of the major roads in the
                    country. So, Yemen was truly successful in persuading most of the major donor
                    nations, including many Western European countries, to give them economic
                    assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>One thing that struck me when I arrived was that they were asking each of us for
                    assistance of all kinds. To some extent, they would ask several countries for
                    the same money for the same project. So, we realized that we needed to get
                    together and have an informal donors group to compare notes. We met once a
                    month. We all talked. The Russians weren't included. They didn't want to join us
                    because their assistance was military and they didn't believe in sharing
                    information. But the Europeans got together. The UN was there. Informally, we
                    talked to the Arabian Peninsula Arab countries to see what the Yemenis had asked
                    for lately and to try to coordinate our policies and decide if they asked two or
                    three countries for the same project, we would decide who would respond. We
                    shared that.</p>
                <p>It was a country which was different in some respects from other places I had
                    been. For example, it is a very decentralized country. There are 50,000 villages
                    in Yemen. The average village has 100 people in it. The Yemenis have not
                    migrated to the cities in large numbers and created huge urban metropolises.
                    They don't like the cities. They prefer to stay in the village even if they
                    don't have any water or electricity in the village. They like their privacy and
                    independence. That, of course, had an effect on the economy, as did their habit
                    of chewing qat every afternoon, which meant that the plantations that used to
                    produce coffee for export were now producing qat, which is only locally
                    consumed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the original source of coffee, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yemen was the original source of coffee. It was a very successful foreign
                    exchange earner until the Yemenis discovered that they liked to chew qat in the
                    afternoon - it is a very mild stimulant - so they replaced the coffee plants
                    with qat. Qat is a product that is not exported. It is a leaf that you have to
                    chew when it's fresh, so you pick it in the morning and chew it in the early
                    afternoon. The money for qat stays in the country and it doesn't help the
                    country develop foreign exchange. So, that was an issue. The Yemeni economy was
                    very heavily dependent on foreign assistance, plus a little bit of oil.</p>
                <p>One thing that surprised me a little bit when I arrived was the heavy security
                    influence over our activities as an embassy. I didn't expect that. I had lived
                    in Egypt during the Nasser period and that was expected. I didn't think Yemen
                    would be like that, but in fact the Yemeni security authorities were watching us
                    so closely and watching every embassy so closely that it made contact work
                    difficult. I lived on the embassy compound in a nice old Yemeni house, a
                    beautiful house. I would invite Yemenis to come to lunch or dinner and every one
                    would be stopped at the gate by a Yemeni security officer asking him for his ID
                    (identification) card and writing down his name in a little book and asking why
                    he wanted to come and see the American ambassador. So, this had a deterrent
                    effect on contacts. I found it much easier to meet Yemenis outside of the
                    compound, which limited my access.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>In my first few months in Sanaa, I had an experience that reinforced this concern
                    about contacts. I talked to the commercial attach� and said, “Why don't we
                    invite a group of Yemeni businessmen to a lunch to get to know them and to
                    promote American commercial interests and establish closer personal ties with
                    the business community?” So, he got together a list of Yemeni businessmen. We
                    hired a hall in the local hotel, the best hotel, sent out invitations. The
                    Foreign Ministry heard about it and said that I should not have done that
                    because the invitations should go through the Foreign Ministry. So, I sent them
                    out again through the Foreign Ministry, hoping that they would be passed on, but
                    not relying entirely on them. I made phone calls around to the invitees to say,
                    “If you didn't get an invitation, you're invited on such and such a day to lunch
                    and we would like to meet you.” There were about four of us from the embassy who
                    went to the lunch expecting a crowd of 30 40 businessmen out of an invitation
                    list of maybe 50. Only one showed up. The reason was that the ones who came were
                    intercepted at the door by a Yemeni plainclothes security officer who whispered
                    in their ear, “Don't go to the American lunch if you know what's good for you.”
                    The one who did show up ignored those warnings, came to the lunch. We had a
                    lunch of five people, four of us from the embassy and one Yemeni. After the
                    lunch, that brave businessman was taken off to the intelligence headquarters and
                    interrogated until midnight as to why he was fraternizing with the Americans.
                    Well, I thought that was an unfriendly thing for the Yemeni authorities to do
                    and I protested to the Foreign Ministry. They never responded in a satisfactory
                    way. They were overzealous in their concern about our contacts with Yemenis.
                    This was a disappointment in the conduct of our official business in Yemen. We
                    weren't targeting dissidents in particular. These were perfectly respectable
                    businessmen and other Yemenis who in other countries where I had served would
                    have no trouble coming to the embassy or coming to an embassy lunch. I raised it
                    with ministers and others in the senior levels of the government and protested
                    to the Foreign Minister. I never changed it very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the other Western embassies having the same
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: They had the same problem. We felt that we were never sure about the
                    Russians. The Russians had very good contacts among the military because most of
                    the Yemeni military officers had been trained in the Soviet Union. It was a
                    curious bifurcation of the senior leadership in Yemen, I thought. If you look at
                    the background of the top level, the elite, in Yemen, all of the military almost
                    without exception at the top levels were trained in the Soviet Union and the
                    Eastern Bloc. They had never been to the United States. They were getting Soviet
                    military equipment which they knew and they had been trained on. So, they were
                    totally oriented in that direction. We found it difficult to even communicate
                    with them. I didn't find them very friendly.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The other half of the government, the civilian side, the Economic Minister, the
                    Foreign Minister, the Prime Minister, were all Western trained. The Foreign
                    Minister had a Ph.D. from Yale. The Prime Minister had a master's degree from
                    Colorado. They spoke fluent English. They understood us when we talked to them.
                    When I made a demarche with the Foreign Minister about American policy, I didn't
                    have to explain very much. He knew exactly what I was saying and where I was
                    coming from. He was a very talented and effective foreign minister, who
                    understood Americans. That was a big advantage to us for starters. He wasn't an
                    American agent or anything like that, but he was easy to talk to. The military
                    was not. So there was a real split in the government and it was an unusual
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I find it interesting with the very heavy dependence on
                        foreign assistance and yet having the military in the hands of the Soviets
                        and with the Soviets hand-in-glove with the regime, which was sort of the
                        hostile regime of South Yemen. I would have thought that there would have
                        been concern all along about when the North Yemeni military was going to
                        take over and when they do, it will obviously be a Soviet thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. That is a good point. We thought about that a lot. We tried to
                    encourage others in the government that would talk to us, including the
                    President, to think carefully about their close relationship with the USSR for
                    this very reason and to be wary of the Soviet connection. So, that was a factor.
                    President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is still in power, was a person who bridged
                    both of these groups. He had not been trained in the Soviet Union and he had not
                    been trained in the United States. He was a tribal person who rose up through
                    the military ranks and had some vested interest in the Soviet relationship
                    because of the military connection. But he was not a person who was pro Soviet
                    in that sense. I think he was maybe innately suspicious of all foreigners,
                    including the Soviets. So, over the course of his career, which has been quite a
                    long one now, he has been skillful in balancing groups and in bringing
                    coalitions together and in having people under him who support different
                    philosophies and different views. So, he presided over a cabinet and a regime
                    which had different tendencies, but I think you're right that there may have
                    been some suspicion on his part of the Soviets. We tried to reinforce that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Saudis feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>RUGH: That was the most interesting aspect of the whole relationship. President
                    Saleh in almost every conversation I had with him talked about the Saudis. That
                    was his primary foreign policy concern. Saudi Arabia was providing economic
                    assistance, but he didn't trust them. When he talked to me, he frequently said,
                    “You Americans take your Yemen policy from Riyadh, from the Saudis.” He believed
                    that we were so close to the Saudis that whenever he had a difference of opinion
                    or a dispute with Saudi Arabia, we would take the Saudi side. I tried to
                    dissuade him from this view. I don't think I succeeded. He was convinced that we
                    were automatically supporting the Saudis if there was any dispute. I would say
                    to him, “We make our own decisions in Washington about our bilateral
                    relationships. We have excellent relations with Saudi Arabia, but it is not a
                    zero sum game. It doesn't mean we have bad relations with you. We support your
                    independence as we support the independence of Saudi Arabia.” He was never quite
                    convinced because he was so concerned about Saudi intervention in Yemen. It was
                    a curious fact that while he was receiving direct subsidies from the Saudi
                    government, tribes along the northern border were also receiving subsidies under
                    the table from the government. He knew that and that worried him. He had had
                    connections with the Saudis from the beginning. They supported him when he came
                    to power in the late 1970s. He told me that the Saudis didn't respect his
                    independence. He said, “The Saudis don't realize that Yemen has grown up. They
                    are treating me like a child instead of a brother.” That rankled. From time to
                    time, there was a period of increasing tension between Saudi Arabia and Yemen
                    and he hoped that we would support him. There were questions about where the
                    border was, for example. These are classic Arabian Peninsula questions. The
                    official border according to our understanding had been delineated only part way
                    between Najran and Jizan. That was back in the 1930s. There was a black line on
                    the maps. But east of Najran through the desert, north of the area which was now
                    an oil concession in North Yemen, there was no officially demarcated border.
                    When there was a dispute, Washington instructed me to go to Ali Abdullah Saleh
                    and discuss it with him, ask him what his intentions were, what his view was of
                    where the border was, and so on. So, one day, I went to see him and I brought a
                    map with me to try to pin him down as to where he asserted his border was. It
                    was one of those large State Department maps of the entire peninsula. I said, “I
                    would like to have your comment on the border.” So, I laid it out on the floor.
                    It was so big that he and I were kneeling on the floor looking at the map. He
                    looked at the map and said, “Who did this map?” I said, “It was produced at the
                    State Department.” He said, “You've done a terrible thing in doing this map.
                    You've put this border right here.” He pointed to where we had indicated the
                    border was. I said, “Mr. President, the caveat on the bottom of the map says
                    that where there is a dotted line or no line at all, just two different colors
                    coming together, the border is undemarcated and the U.S. government takes no
                    official position on that line.” He said, “But you've put a line here between
                    Yemen and Saudi Arabia and there is no border.” I said, “Mr. President, we have
                    to show two different countries somehow by doing them in two different colors.
                    We've got to put it somewhere. It's totally arbitrary and we just put it where
                    it is generally agreed, we thought, that the Saudis stopped and the Yemenis
                    began.” He said, “That is a violation of our sovereignty and it's an unfriendly
                    act for you to have put that line there.” I said, “Mr. President, where should
                    the line be? Where would you put it?” He said, “Well, it could be anywhere.
                    There is no line. It could be up here.” He pointed to just south of Riyadh. I
                    knew that he was trying to make a point that we shouldn't interfere and
                    arbitrarily give the Saudis any more than he wanted to bargain for. My view at
                    the time (still is) was that he was not saying that he wanted to take over
                    southern Saudi Arabia, but that he wanted to leave his options open in any
                    negotiation with the Saudis and didn't want anybody to preempt him. I happened
                    to know at the time that a map had been published in Saudi Arabia showing Saudi
                    Arabia encroaching way down into Yemen. I didn't mention that to him, but I
                    thought he probably knew that. So, it was a matter of some sensitivity. When the
                    Saudis came even a few kilometers across the arbitrary line that we had on our
                    map, he reacted, complained, and protested. So, I knew that our line was pretty
                    accurate, but he didn't want to make any official concession until the issue was
                    sorted out. It still hasn't been sorted out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No. We only intervened politically in encouraging both the Saudis and the
                    Yemenis to come to agreement between themselves, to negotiate it in a friendly
                    fashion. The Yemenis asked us to put pressure on the Saudis to be reasonable.
                    The Saudis, in effect, told our embassy in Riyadh that it was none of our
                    business, to stay out of it completely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. All of our reporting on any of these issues went laterally as well to
                    our ambassador in Riyadh. He reciprocated, gave us his reporting on Saudi
                    conversations relating to Yemen. I went up there and Ambassador Cutler came down
                    to Yemen. We consulted often. But the two protagonists didn't really want us
                    involved unless we were going to take their side. So, our main effort was to try
                    to get them to talk together in a friendly fashion.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>RUGH: They were tense. Since they were two different types of regime and two
                    competing Yemeni administrations who knew each other well personally but didn't
                    trust each other, they were always tense. The tension reached a crisis stage in
                    January of 1986 when there was a coup d'etat attempted in South Yemen, a very
                    bloody one. A cabinet meeting was shot up by one of the political leaders in the
                    South and a number of South Yemeni ministers were killed. The Prime Minister
                    fled to North Yemen and took refuge in the North, which didn't improve
                    relations. In fact, it was a cause of some tension. North Yemen supported him in
                    exile and officially, publicly declared their support for him. That made things
                    worse. The South Yemenis were sending people North who were regarded by the
                    Northerners as threats, assassination teams. As far as I recall, there weren't
                    any assassinations carried out by North Yemenis, but the North Yemenis were
                    convinced that that was going on. The South Yemenis expected that the North was
                    doing the same. So, it was a very tense period in early 1986. This went on for
                    some time. North Yemen asked us for assistance in watching South Yemeni military
                    deployments because the two military forces moved toward the border facing each
                    other and they were concerned about each other. South Yemen has a small
                    population, but they had a fairly substantial military. We thought at the time
                    that the militaries were roughly comparable. The North had more men, but the
                    South, we thought, in any conflict, would be able to hold its own - certainly,
                    if the conflict were carried out on South Yemeni territory. We were concerned
                    that a conflict might break out, the Soviets might intervene, and then we would
                    be faced with the choice of how to deal with that question of a North-South
                    conflict with the Soviets on the side of the South. It didn't happen, but there
                    were thousands of South Yemeni refugees who came North and were in camps along
                    the border. They were itching to go back and fight against the regime. The North
                    was tempted to send them back in, but hesitated because they weren't convinced
                    that they could overwhelm the South. So, it was a very tense period in the
                    spring of 1986.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the United States and your embassy play
                        during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Since we had good relations with North Yemen and no relations with South
                    Yemen, we conferred very closely with the North on the crisis, on the conflict.
                    The North Yemenis wanted our assistance. We had provided a little bit of
                    military assistance in the form of mostly some F 5 fighter planes, and they
                    wanted more. They wanted intelligence about what was going on in the South and
                    we discussed that with them. They wanted our undivided attention and support
                    against the South. We didn't want to provoke a conflict or encourage a conflict.
                    In fact, we encouraged a peaceful settlement of the dispute. But we didn't want
                    to indicate that we were uninterested in a dispute between a Marxist
                    Soviet-controlled South Yemen and a nonaligned North Yemen. So, we gave what
                    diplomatic and political support we could to the North.</p>

                        either they'd better find another patron, at least for this time, or they
                        might get cut off at the knees because of what the Soviets did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, that's right. In fact, there were some tensions between North Yemen
                    and the Soviets. The North Yemenis were accusing the Soviets of backing the
                    wrong horse and there were words exchanged between the senior officials in North
                    Yemen and the Soviets as far as our reporting could find out what was going on
                    in those conversations. So, it was a period of tension between North Yemen and
                    the USSR. The Soviets had trouble explaining what was going on in the South
                    because the North Yemenis assumed that the Soviets were in control in the South
                    and could restrain the South Yemenis if they wanted to and why weren't they
                    doing so? It is a little bit parallel to the Arab belief that the United States
                    can control the Israelis and why aren't we doing it? So, there was a bad patch
                    for the Soviets in North Yemen during this period.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We certainly didn't hesitate to remind the North Yemenis that South Yemen
                    was a Marxist Soviet outpost. They knew that. They were more focused on the
                    tribal and personal conflict, but we pointed out that the South Yemenis were
                    fully armed by the Soviets and we encouraged them to put pressure on the Soviets
                    to put pressure on the South Yemenis, which they did, or tried to.</p>

                <p>RUGH: Right. Exactly. And we didn't want an escalation which would draw the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>RUGH: I'm pretty sure it was. I know that North Yemen actually sent troops to
                    Iraq. We thought at the time that it was the only contingent of actual fighting
                    forces from any Arab country that went to the front and tried to help Iraq.
                    There was a very cordial and mutually supportive relationship between Iraq and
                    North Yemen. The North Yemenis had received economic assistance from Iraq and,
                    in return, Ali Abdullah Saleh had sent military assistance and was giving them
                    political support. This became important later during the 1990 Gulf Crisis when
                    Saddam called in that chip and got North Yemen to support his venture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That put them really at odds with all of their
                        other...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. This is jumping ahead of the story, but one of the reasons President
                    Saleh supported Saddam Hussein in 1990 1991 was because of Saleh's distrust of
                    the Saudis. The Saudis were clearly hostile to Saddam Hussein's invasion of
                    Kuwait and it made it easier for Ali Abdullah to support Saddam knowing that
                    this would be a thorn in the side of the Saudis. That was one of the
                    factors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With your USIA background, talking about how difficult it
                        was to make personal contacts there, what about through the traditional
                        broadcast films, books, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That is a good question because the Yemenis distinguished between different
                    people at the embassy, assuming that the USIS personnel were not the threat that
                    the ambassador and the political officer were. So, the political officer, the
                    DCM, and I had a difficult time making contacts, but the PAO didn't. He had very
                    good access. They regarded him as a benign cultural officer. In fact, this
                    distinction was so apparent that the political officer who was at post when I
                    first arrived, Jack McCreary, a superb State Department political officer who
                    had served with distinction in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, ended his tour and
                    said, “I really wish I had been PAO instead of political officer here because
                    the PAO has contacts and the political officer doesn't.” I said, “Why don't you
                    stay on as PAO” and he did. We worked it out with the Agency so that he would
                    have an assignment as PAO. He liked it so much that he converted to USIA from
                    State and he is still with USIA and has had a very distinguished career. He was
                    pleasantly rewarded with very good contacts. He was the same guy who had been
                    there as political officer and nobody would talk to him and now he was the PAO
                    and he had contacts all over town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you're talking about contacts, how were these used?
                        What was the purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>RUGH: We wanted to track Yemeni political, economic, and foreign policy
                    developments, their relations with the various other countries, including in
                    particular the Soviet Union. The hardest information to collect was what was
                    going on between North Yemen and the Soviet Union. But we were also interested
                    in knowing what the North Yemenis were thinking with respect to South Yemen and
                    to Saudi Arabia, their two immediate neighbors. Those were more important to
                    them than anything else. So, we sought through official channels to keep track
                    of these relationships and through personal contacts to the extent that we
                    could. Yemenis are, if you can generalize, independent of their own government
                    and, in private, willing to talk and, to the extent that they knew what was
                    going on, they would talk, if we could sit with them. The Yemeni qat chew is an
                    occasion where people of all kinds come together. It is very democratic.
                    Ministers, drivers, and others sit together and chew qat. They tend to talk. So,
                    we went to qat chews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the effect of qat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The effect of qat is very mild compared to almost any other kind of
                    stimulant. If you chew qat for three or four hours, it's like drinking a few
                    cups of coffee. It's a stimulant. It keeps you awake. The way to get the effect
                    of this is to stuff qat leaves in your mouth and chew them and chew them and
                    leave the leaves in your cheek and the juice from the leaf is swallowed. You can
                    chew for an hour and not feel any effect at all. It affects people differently.
                    If you chew for two or three hours, you begin to feel slightly euphoric, more
                    talkative than usual, and it makes you feel good. But certainly nothing compared
                    to more serious drugs and the effect takes so long that you have to sit there
                    and chew for a long time. I went to several qat chews and only chewed a little
                    bit and didn't feel anything at all at first. It was only after chewing for
                    hours that I felt it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking it would be hard to carry on a conversation
                        with that wad of leaves in your mouth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It is. It's not easy particularly for a novice and it's not terribly
                    pleasant. You get very thirsty, so you have to drink a lot of water or Pepsi
                    Cola. They tend to smoke a lot when they're chewing. If you're not a smoker,
                    that's not great. But they were wonderful occasions to meet people. It was a
                    good excuse. Typically, they have a big heavy meal at lunchtime at one o'clock.
                    By two o'clock, they're done and breaking out the qat and sitting around. They
                    may sit there until five or six.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That takes care of the work of the afternoon.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>RUGH: Right. It wipes out the afternoon. If you go into the bazaar, the souk, in
                    the afternoon, typically, you'll see a shop owner sitting on the floor in the
                    back of his shop chewing qat and he won't have the slightest interest in selling
                    you anything. You sort of have to make your way around the shop and persuade him
                    to take your money because he is enjoying his afternoon qat chew. It's better to
                    go in the morning when he's interested in bargaining and talking to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of a political life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No. It was an authoritarian regime, no elections, no political parties, no
                    interest groups, no independent newspapers, all of the media were controlled.
                    The political life was behind the scenes. It really involved tribal leaders and
                    other political leaders who made deals with the government and with each other
                    behind the scenes. The Yemeni government was not entirely in control of the
                    whole country of North Yemen because the tribal leaders had enormous authority
                    outside of the major cities. For example, rural criminal cases were adjudicated,
                    in effect, by the tribal leader, not by the court system. The police didn't do
                    law enforcement outside of the major cities. If somebody committed a crime
                    (theft, murder, assault, etc.), the tribe dealt with it outside the cities, not
                    the central government. So, that, in a sense, was the politics of North
                    Yemen.</p>
                <p>In a couple of conversations I had with the President of North Yemen, we
                    discussed democracy and elections. He told me in no uncertain terms that he was
                    opposed to both. The idea of competing political parties was inappropriate
                    because it would divide the nation and you needed national unity. He didn't see
                    why you needed an opposition party when you could have one party that
                    represented the national will. Why have more than one because there is only one
                    national will and you certainly don't need elections. This was in the period
                    1984-1987, and three years after I left they had elections, parties, opposition
                    newspapers, the whole nine yards. That has continued to this day. At the time I
                    was there, he said flatly, “We will have no political parties, no opposition
                    parties, no elections. It's not good for us.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any delegations or visits from the United
                        States while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>RUGH: Not many. We had one very effective one, one very important one. That was
                    by Vice President Bush. Vice President Bush in early 1986 was making a tour of
                    the Arabian Peninsula. He was visiting Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, and Kuwait,
                    and didn't intend to come to our part of the peninsula. I requested that he add
                    on Yemen to his itinerary and he did so. He came just at the time when the Hunt
                    Oil Company was ready to inaugurate with the President of Yemen the refinery
                    that they had built in the desert in the eastern part of Yemen. It was the first
                    refinery that Yemen had. It had just been completed. So, he came and
                    participated in that. It was a good occasion. He spent three days in Yemen. He
                    enjoyed it very much, learned a lot about Yemen. It was terrific for our
                    relationship because it was the first vice presidential visit to Yemen ever, as
                    far as I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suspect he got on the phone to the ruling president
                        during the Kuwait Gulf Crisis later because of that contact, but to no
                        avail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That is correct. They liked each other. They established a cordial
                    relationship. But you're right. He did make those phone calls later, but it
                    didn't dissuade the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any role for women in the society? Were there
                        any women officers at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes and yes. The Yemeni women participated in the government. There weren't
                    any ministers, but they were in some important positions in the various
                    ministries. And they were in business. Yemeni women, unlike Saudi women, were
                    allowed to drive cars. Yemeni women certainly throughout the country in the
                    rural areas provided most of the workforce. They were working in the fields
                    while the men were chewing qat. The men did some agricultural work, too, but the
                    women certainly carried the bulk of it. If you lived in a small village on top
                    of a mountain and the only water supply was down in the valley, it was a woman
                    who went down the mountain and carried the bucket of water back up on her head.
                    They were tough, independent, hardworking, and industrious. But also in the
                    cities, women were involved. They dressed modestly in public and they were
                    conservative in their social behavior, but they were involved in the
                    economy.</p>
                <p>On the other question, we had a woman administrative officer at the embassy who
                    was terrific and very, very effective, Georgia DeBell, who later went on to be
                    DCM in Kuwait and came back to Yemen as DCM. She worked extremely well with her
                    Yemeni local staff and negotiated important agreements for the embassies with
                    Yemeni officials, landlords, businesspeople. She spoke Arabic. She had very
                    strong interpersonal skills and the fact that she was a women was not a
                    deterrent to her or to the Yemenis. The Yemenis to some extent regard foreign
                    women, particularly Western women, in a different category. They know that women
                    in American society have a different place from women in Yemeni society. So,
                    they regarded her with respect and she was very effective.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>RUGH: It was very pleasant, very interesting, very satisfying with the exception
                    of the difficulties in making official contacts that I mentioned. It was
                    interesting to travel in and visit. I made a lot of trips around the countryside
                    to observe and understand what was going on in the country because so much of
                    the economy is in the rural areas. We had a wonderful Peace Corps contingent in
                    Yemen and many of them were women and were very successful. They were all over
                    the country. I would use the excuse of a Peace Corps volunteer being in a remote
                    village to visit the village and spend some time there, spend the night and get
                    to know the people. I did that for a couple of reasons. One, I wanted to show
                    support for the Peace Corps volunteers' work, but also, it was very useful for
                    me to visit a village where the Peace Corps was because they would know the
                    village well and be able to give me a quick briefing on what was going on in the
                    village, what was interesting about the village, and they were always prominent
                    visitors in the village, and so it opened doors for me. So, one of the most
                    pleasant and rewarding aspects of working in Yemen was having the Peace Corps
                    there. We had about 50 volunteers. Without exception, they were terrific. They
                    weren't all young. Some of them were retired. Two women were in their late 60s
                    teaching typing in a local school for public administration and secretarial
                    personnel. They loved it. Every single Peace Corps volunteer loved living in
                    Yemen. If their particular assignment didn't work out, they would say to the
                    Peace Corps, “Find me another job in Yemen. Don't transfer me to another country
                    because I love it here.” They got into the local culture. They would chew qat
                    and they trekked around the country and learned Arabic very well. The only small
                    problem I had with the Peace Corps was a curious one. There was a group of about
                    three assigned to teach English in a center in Yemen run by USIS called the
                    Yemen American Language Institute. All of the students were Yemenis. It was a
                    very well-run center managed by USIS and USIS had some of its own teachers, but
                    was glad to have Peace Corps volunteers to supplement their teaching staff.
                    These teachers taught there for a few weeks and then said, “We don't want to
                    teach in this place anymore.” I said, “Why?” They said, “In the first place,
                    there are pictures of the President of the United States on the wall and this is
                    a propaganda center. That is not what we came here for. We came here to teach
                    English, not to spread American political propaganda.” I said, “You're free to
                    say what you like in the classroom. Nobody is writing your script. But if you
                    want to leave, that's up to you. What is the other reason that you're not happy
                    here?” They said, “Well, it's too nice. When we joined the Peace Corps, we were
                    told that we were going to have to sit under a tree and maybe sleep out of doors
                    and not have even a blackboard and it was going to be very tough, primitive
                    conditions. Here we have air conditioning, lights, running water, and toilets.
                    That is not what we came here for.” I said, “It's up to you. If you want worse
                    conditions, maybe that can be arranged.” So, they demanded a transfer out of
                    this nice facility, this “propaganda center” and they were transferred over to a
                    Yemeni training school which satisfied their conditions. But they very quickly
                    realized that along with those primitive conditions and the absence of President
                    Reagan's picture were sort of a disorganized management and a lack of motivation
                    on the part of the students and not a very satisfying teaching environment. They
                    decided that they wanted to come back to the USIS-run, well lit, and air
                    conditioned center. But that was the only little flap.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If those were the only problems we had to solve! Is there
                        anything else that we should cover about the Yemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We've covered all of the major issues. There is only one other issue that
                    might be of some importance and that is that we started constructing a new
                    embassy facility during that period. Congress had provided very generous funding
                    for new embassies based on security after the Inman Report. The security people
                    came out from Washington, looked at our compound, and were shocked at the lack
                    of security. We had a collection of old Yemeni buildings which were partly stone
                    and partly mud. The perimeter wall was mud, which blew down in a heavy wind. The
                    wall was six feet away from the ambassador's office. We were surrounded by other
                    tall Yemeni buildings. They said, “This is a disaster. You have to move. We'll
                    give you x million dollars to build a new compound” so we did. During the time
                    that I was there, we broke ground and began the construction. I left before it
                    was completed, but the major problem for me was arguing with the security people
                    over the characteristics of the building. They insisted on making it a fortress
                    and I was trying to argue for some aesthetic and practical features. For
                    example, they insisted that the chancery building have reinforced concrete with
                    windows that had ballistic glass and couldn't be opened. I said, “This will be
                    the only building in all of Yemen where the windows don't open. The weather in
                    Sanaa, which is high in the mountains, is beautiful year round. You have
                    beautiful fresh air that goes right through the building. In our current
                    chancery, you just open the windows and lovely fresh breezes blow through. If
                    you seal the windows closed and you have an electric power failure, which
                    happens every week, you'll have to leave the building. It will be impossible to
                    stay inside.” They said, “We'll build a redundant power system and a generator,”
                    so they did. So, I lost that battle. That was a bureaucratic skirmish, but I
                    always thought it was very shortsighted of the security people to insist. They
                    were paying for it, but they shouldn't control everything.</p>

                <p>RUGH: I was reassigned to USIA headquarters, which in turn gave me a year as
                    diplomat in residence at the Fletcher School. USIA has had for many years a slot
                    at the Murrow Center of the Fletcher School which at that time was supervised by
                    Hewson Ryan, a retired USIA officer who had an assignment at the Fletcher School
                    at Tufts as a professor of public diplomacy. Within his shop at Fletcher, there
                    was a one year diplomat in residence position that traditionally went to a USIS
                    officer. I had that for a year and then was able to get it for a second year. I
                    taught public diplomacy and I also developed a course on U.S. policy in the
                    Middle East, which I offered to Fletcher students. I had a class of about 30
                    from all over the world, graduate students who were interested in U.S. policy in
                    the Middle East.</p>

                        the wares that are produced. I am not overly impressed. There seems to be an
                        attempt to have a logic in what is almost (at least in the details) an
                        illogical affair responding to events. What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>RUGH: I have always thought that there ought to be more cooperation and
                    involvement between academics and practitioners on the Middle East and there
                    hasn't been much. I found that not many academics really have a good
                    understanding of the policymaking process and the constraints on policymakers.
                    There are few exceptions. Bill Quandt, who is at the University of Virginia, was
                    at Brookings, and was at Rand, also served in the government twice in the
                    National Security Council. He has an excellent understanding of the policy
                    process and the constraints on policymakers. His writing on U.S. policy in the
                    Middle East is outstanding, but he is an exception. There aren't many
                    exceptions. Much of the academic writing on the Middle East really doesn't
                    understand the policy process very well at all. There are academics who have a
                    good understanding of individual Middle Eastern countries, but when it comes to
                    the Arab-American relationship, they often take one slice of it or they don't
                    really have a good grasp of the whole picture. It's too bad. INR at State and
                    USIA had tried to bring in academics to have a useful exchange. I tried to do
                    that from time to time. There are some academics who are very helpful, but their
                    audience is different and their perception of the world is often different from
                    that of a person involved in daily policymaking. They don't appreciate what we
                    do and we don't appreciate what they do very much. I have tried to do some
                    writing myself of a sort of an academic nature in order to try to bridge that
                    gap. Now in my present occupation, I am trying to do more of that. But there
                    isn't a great deal that is coming out of academic writers that is terribly
                    useful for policymakers. The policymakers focus on today's crisis. For example,
                    one of the main journals, The International Journal of Middle East Studies, has
                    really nothing of value to a policymaker except some of the book reviews in the
                    back. The articles are historical, academic, and arcane. The Middle East Journal
                    is quite a bit better. Many of their articles are useful, but some of them where
                    they talk about politics reflect a lack of understanding of what a policymaker
                    faces in real choices. However, The Middle East Journal is a useful journal. I
                    read it regularly. Policymakers don't have time or don't take time to read books
                    very much and they don't read all the journal articles. If you're sitting in an
                    embassy, you have so many telegrams to read and so much other material to deal
                    with that very few embassy officers on any level take the time to read what is
                    coming out of academia. So, there isn't a lot of impact on the policy process. I
                    think even in Washington, the policymakers sitting here don't read a great deal
                    of that. Some do. People in INR tend to. Middle East Policy, which is published
                    quarterly by the Middle East Policy Council, has some policy relevant material
                    and a lot of it is academic and a lot of it is political, so that tends to be
                    more useful. There isn't a lot of material. I have gone to conferences of
                    academics, but the main one is the Middle East Studies Association. Most of the
                    papers there are pretty esoteric and academic and are not useful to
                    policymakers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were teaching in what has always been one of the two
                        trickiest areas. The Middle East is probably the trickiest. The next one is
                        probably the China policy. You have an extremely important organization
                        which is the American Israeli Public Affairs Council (AIPAC) and also with
                        an Israeli government which is very aggressively working every media to
                        pursue its policy. Did you, particularly coming from dealing with the Arab
                        world, find any impact, pressures, or influence when you were going to what
                        essentially is a (I am not using this in the pejorative) trade school of
                        people who really are interested in foreign policy and are more likely to
                        end up dealing with foreign affairs either from the business or government
                        point of view than almost any other school at Fletcher. Can you comment on
                        this at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The students at Fletcher are outstanding. Fletcher has the ability to
                    select from a very large pool of applicants. They take one out of six or seven
                    candidates. They have some terrific students and a lot of them are much more
                    mature than the average student, in their 30s. They've had a career and are
                    coming back for some more study. Plus, they have a very large foreign student
                    population at Fletcher. So, in my class on Middle East policy, I had a lot of
                    Arabs, some Israelis, some Pakistanis, and a minority of Americans. The Arabs
                    and the Israelis were much better informed than the Americans. We had a very
                    high level of discussion because of their background and their base of
                    information. I didn't really have the problem of starting from zero, which I
                    understand happens in many classes on the Middle East with a strictly American
                    student body; zero or minus zero if you want to start with prejudices and
                    misinformation. Some American students are well informed. They have a good
                    understanding of what is going on in the region. The American press doesn't give
                    a complete picture of the Middle East by any means. Unless you search for
                    information and make an effort to inform yourself or unless you've lived abroad
                    and followed up, it's hard for an American to have a lot of basic information.
                    The organizations you mentioned are active in putting out their side of the
                    story. In those days, in the 1980s, there was no Internet access to Arab
                    newspapers as there is now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about first electronic way of reaching out
                        and getting information via this huge electronic off the air
                        (Internet).</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>RUGH: Right. The Internet sources that American students now have and use include
                    quite a number of Arab newspapers, weekly and daily, in English as well as in
                    Arabic. So, a student who wants to inform himself or herself about the Arab
                    world or about Israel or about the Middle East in general, has an opportunity to
                    do so. That didn't exist in the 1980s when I was teaching. Among my students at
                    Fletcher, the Americans who had never lived abroad didn't really know much about
                    the Middle East and lacked a basic understanding of what the situation was
                    there. Of course, the Arab and Israeli students had information, but they had
                    their own perspectives, so it was a fascinating opportunity to bring together
                    people from very different viewpoints to talk about American policy and try to
                    explain what policymakers go through in developing policy. I found that there
                    were even differences in attitude about what is proper in the classroom. Some of
                    the American and Israeli students would question my statements in my lecture
                    very vigorously and a few of the Arab students would come up afterwards and
                    apologize for their colleagues having been rude to me. I would have to explain
                    that that is normal in an American classroom, and said they could express their
                    strong views and criticism of American policy. I think because of the nature of
                    the student body, they were much better informed than the typical class that you
                    find in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Away from the student body at the faculty level, and not
                        just at Fletcher, but beyond, that the academic world was making efforts to
                        come at the Middle East problem with a certain amount of objectivity in
                        looking at it rather than particularly from the Israeli point of view or
                        from the Arab point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: A lot of people in general, including academics, have biases based on their
                    own experience, on their own personal preferences, on their own background. Many
                    American academics have connections with Israel, have visited Israel and no
                    other place in the Middle East. Some American academics have connections with
                    the Arab world and have never visited Israel. They tend to have strong opinions
                    about American policy and about what is going on in the region and certainly
                    will express them in private. I didn't find that there was a lot of exchange of
                    substance among professors. I guess that was a big disappointment to me. I
                    assumed, having been a student for a long time, that professors got together and
                    had these high level very erudite discussions about issues of public concern.
                    They don't. They may be insecure about doing that in front of their peers and
                    it's more comfortable to stand up in front of a class and be the professor and
                    profess than it is with your peers. But they don't seem to give much time to
                    having exchanges with other professors. They devote most of their attention to
                    teaching and to writing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1989, where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I came back to Washington and took over at USIA as director of Near
                    East/North Africa/South Asia Bureau.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was moderately late into the Bush administration. Who
                        was the director of USIA? Could you characterize how you saw USIA being run
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The director was Bruce Gelb, a political appointee, as almost all USIA
                    directors have been. He didn't know a great deal about foreign affairs, was
                    eager to learn, was eager to make USIA a player in Washington among foreign
                    affairs agencies and had his staff trying to develop USIA's special role. He
                    attended the meetings of the Secretary of State every morning and would call on
                    some of us to provide him with talking points that he could take to the
                    Secretary's meeting to enhance the role of USIA as a policymaking organization
                    or at least an advisory agency that could help the Secretary of State. That had
                    only limited success. He was dealing with our long tradition of USIA playing a
                    very subordinate role in Washington. It played a much bigger role in the field
                    at embassies. In an embassy, where you have a public affairs officer
                    representing USIA who has a lot of good contacts and knows a lot about what is
                    going on in the country, the ambassador, the DCM, or the political officer
                    values participation of that USIA officer. In Washington, the director of USIA
                    can't really play that same role. He is sitting in Washington where he doesn't
                    have that expertise to bring to bear. Gelb tried to develop that role along
                    similar lines. He instructed his PAOs throughout the world to send him hot items
                    that he could carry over to the Secretary of State's morning meeting so he could
                    be a player. He received some items from the field, but they were usually not of
                    the caliber to raise with the Secretary of State in a short meeting in the
                    morning. Sometimes when they were, others in the room resented his bringing them
                    up because the items seemed to be sort of political reporting that the Assistant
                    Secretary of State for the Near East should have been reporting on.</p>
                <p>On my level, I dealt with the State Department's Bureau of Near East/North
                    Africa/South Asian Affairs until South Asia was split off and then I dealt with
                    both of them. I found that I could make a contribution to the meetings that I
                    went to, particularly in the area of public opinion. Whenever an opinion poll
                    was taken in Israel or occasionally in one of the Arab countries, I would report
                    it. That was of interest to the Assistant Secretary and his staff. Whenever we
                    had some special report from our PAOs that reflected transient opinion that
                    might be related to American policy, I reported that and that was of
                    interest.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the Baker time at the State Department. At

                        seem to be an awful lot of give and take. One had the feeling he wasn't
                        reaching down very much. I would imagine that the USIA contribution... This
                        would have been the hardest administration to break as opposed to many other
                        Secretaries who were more open.</hi>

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>RUGH: That's correct. So, it wasn't a very successful effort. We all thought it
                    was important that USIA be a player and we all tried to help Bruce Gelb and we
                    all tried to do it on our own levels. But it was tough. It was very tough. That
                    changed a bit when the Gulf Crisis erupted in August of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at USIA from 1989 to 1992. Could you talk about
                        the Gulf Crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: When the Gulf Crisis began in August of 1990 as a result of Saddam
                    Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, an interagency task force was set up to deal with
                    public diplomacy issues. I co-chaired it with a State Department officer, and
                    USIA had a major role. I was deputy chairman of the task force as the USIA
                    representative, but there were other USIA representatives coming from the Voice
                    of America, our Research Office at USIA, and some others. The Pentagon was
                    included. April Glaspie, our ambassador in Baghdad, who was in Washington during
                    the crisis, was on it. We had about 20 people who met regularly, once a week at
                    least. Then we had an executive group that met even more often. We coordinated
                    public diplomacy during the Gulf Crisis for those months between August of 1990
                    and March of 1991. We attempted to develop themes for all of us to stress in
                    USIA's output as well as the State Department spokesman's output. We gave them
                    recommendations. My office developed a monitoring system for Middle East, South
                    Asia, and North Africa reaction to American policy. We turned out papers almost
                    on a daily basis summarizing what the region was saying both in media and in
                    private conversations. I sent those papers to the Secretary of State, to the
                    Assistant Secretary, and to others around the government, all of the
                    participants in the task force, including the Department of Defense (DOD). I
                    know that those were read by policymakers at State and DOD. We developed some
                    projects. For example, we decided to do a film which would carry the theme
                    directed at Saddam Hussein, “If you go to war with the United States, Iraq will
                    be severely punished.” The reason we thought that was important was because
                    Saddam was giving everybody the impression that he was unafraid of engaging in a
                    military conflict and that he was not flinching, he was not willing to withdraw.
                    There was a period from August into January of 1991 where the Secretary of
                    State, the President, and all of our friends and allies tried to persuade Saddam
                    to withdraw and he didn't and the war eventually came. We were trying in our
                    public diplomacy effort to prevent the outbreak of war by persuading him to
                    withdraw because it would be foolish of him to fight the allies, including the
                    United States. So, with the help of DOD, we put together a film that was
                    produced by USIA's Film Division. We developed a script and visuals which
                    conveyed the power of the American military. Our purpose was to produce this and
                    have it distributed all over the region and get it into Iraq. We had ways of
                    getting it into Iraq, we thought. We thought we would get it to Saddam. We did
                    the film. It took longer than it should have because we ended up getting
                    clearances. The Assistant Secretary of State gave it to the Under Secretary, who
                    gave it to the Secretary, who showed it to the President. It shouldn't have gone
                    through all of those clearances. We should have just done it at our level and
                    gotten it out. But it eventually got out. Obviously, it didn't prevent Saddam
                    from going to the brink. That was one example of the kind of thing we were
                    doing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to go back a bit. Here you were, dealing with
                        the Middle East and the seizure of Kuwait took place. At your level, were
                        there intimations that this was coming? Prior to the actual event, what was
                        the administrative reading on Saddam Hussein?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: No, we were all surprised. In the last few days before the actual invasion,
                    in the last week of July, the intelligence assessment was that, yes, he might
                    well invade. But until that time, we thought it was bluff. We thought that the
                    Iraqis would not actually go in, certainly not to take over the entire country
                    of Kuwait. There was some thought that there was a possibility that he might
                    make a small incursion into northern Kuwait and occupy part of it, but never
                    take over the whole country. That was not expected for a lot of reasons. It
                    wasn't expected by the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, or the American intelligence
                    community. There are some people who, after the fact, claim that they expected
                    it, but there is not a lot of evidence, certainly up until the middle of July.
                    So, we were surprised. No Arab country had ever done this before and the Saudis
                    thought that they understood Saddam and the Kuwaitis did, too, and that he was
                    just rattling his saber and wouldn't actually use it. So, we were surprised.</p>
                <p>I was in Baghdad myself on the first of April when Saddam made a talk in front of
                    some of his senior military people in which he issued some threats against
                    Israel. I watched it on Iraqi TV, and I regarded it as serious, but it wasn't
                    that much out of line from what we had heard before from Saddam and some others
                    about threats to Israel. At that time, I didn't think it was conceivable that he
                    would be firing Scuds in the beginning of 1991 into Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Scuds being relatively short-range missiles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. In February of 1991, Iraq was actually firing Scud missiles into
                    Israel. That was inconceivable in the spring of 1990. We didn't think it would
                    come to that and we didn't expect anything like that. I visited our embassy in
                    Baghdad, talked to our ambassador, the PAO, the intelligence people, and the
                    military attach�, all of whom were very smart processionals doing their best to
                    find out what was going on in Iraq. It was one of the most closed societies that
                    we dealt with. There was more information coming out of Iran, where we had no
                    embassy, than there was out of Iraq just because of the difficulty of finding
                    out what was going on. Saddam didn't tip his hand when he went in. When I was
                    there in March and April just before the invasion, the embassy and we in USIA
                    and State all saw hopeful signs. Saddam had lifted the travel ban for scholars
                    and students to come to the United States. USIA was teaching English in Baghdad
                    and we thought that this was an opening that was the beginning of a thaw, that
                    the long period of estrangement between America and Iraq was beginning to come
                    to an end and we were looking for opportunities to expand those contacts. We
                    were hopeful. We just didn't expect that Saddam would do what he did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the August 1, 1990, Saddam's army came in and took over
                        all of Kuwait. I would have thought that, particularly at the beginning
                        outside of the military buildup, this would have put tremendous pressure,
                        particularly on your area, dealing with the majority of the Islamic world,
                        to build up a coalition and to bring your old friends, the Yemenis, and also
                        the Jordanians and Palestinians into line, to make sure the Islamic world
                        did not see this as the West versus Islam and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. Those were central issues to our concern. Saddam was playing the
                    Islamic card, the Arab nationalist card, and the anti-Israel card for all they
                    were worth in his propaganda. We were afraid that this was going to have an
                    effect throughout the region. We were reassured when Egypt gave the United
                    States strong support. Egypt is crucial in this equation. It has always played a
                    leadership role. The Egyptian position of strong support for the American-led
                    confrontation of Saddam was a relief to us. We knew that that would be helpful.
                    Of course, the first prerequisite for the coalition in terms of Arab support for
                    it was that the Gulf states, the Saudis and the rest of the Gulf Cooperation
                    Council (GCC) states, the small states on the Persian Gulf, all strongly
                    supported the confrontation of Saddam. That was prerequisite number one. When
                    that was achieved and the Egyptians supported it, we were in much better shape
                    than we could have been otherwise. Then, as for the states you mentioned, Jordan
                    and Yemen, we in USIA worked to support the State Department and the White House
                    in trying to persuade them to join the coalition and we failed. We all failed.
                    Yemen was a big disappointment. For its own reasons, Yemen decided to support
                    Saddam. In Jordan, King Hussein felt he was in a difficult position depending
                    economically on Iraq, being contiguous with Iraq, being far weaker than Iraq
                    militarily. He was afraid to oppose Saddam. So, that was a disappointment.</p>
                <p>Syria was helpful. Syria joined the coalition. The lack of enthusiasm in North
                    Africa was less of a problem because they were more remote from the conflict.
                    The key states really were the ones I mentioned, particularly the GCC states of
                    the Arabian Peninsula, and Egypt, plus Syria. That was enough to sustain a
                    strong coalition.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>USIA played a minor role in all of this. The secret of the success of that
                    coalition was the active involvement of the President of the United States, the
                    Secretary of State, our terrific ambassador to the UN, Tom Pickering, and a lot
                    of work on the part of our ambassadors and PAOs throughout the region. We got
                    enough support to make it work. We got UN votes. Our work with the Russians was
                    also very helpful. Keeping the Russians on our side instead of supporting Saddam
                    was very important as well. The President, however, was never sure until January
                    1991 that this coalition was strong enough to sustain an American-led military
                    action against Iraq. In retrospect, it looked easy. The war was over quickly and
                    with limited casualties. But there was a lot of uncertainty. You can't predict
                    in advance how well you're going to do in a conflict like that. Iraq had an
                    enormous army and was well equipped. It was the most powerful state in the
                    region militarily. Even though the United States has the most modern, advanced,
                    and well trained military, there were people in the Pentagon who were warning
                    that this was not going to be a cakewalk. This was going to be very tough. One
                    part of this was the question of “Do we have the support of the Arabs, not only
                    the government, but the Arab public?” That was a question that we asked every
                    day. We tried to help the President, the Secretary of State, the Assistant
                    Secretary, and the Defense Department get a good handle on that. I had two
                    meetings in the Oval Office with the President, George Bush, to talk about that
                    issue specifically, how much support do we have from the Arabs now and in the
                    case of a military conflict? Will the Arabs support us? I testified on the Hill
                    on that question. There were some in Congress who thought that we did not have
                    sufficient Arab support in the streets and among the Arab public to make us
                    confident that we could prosecute the confrontation with Saddam. So, this was a
                    very important issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was watching television, as everyone else was, at the
                        time. One after another of people, many of whom I've interviewed for this
                        program, would get up and they all talked about the Arab mob as though the
                        Arabs were so volatile that they would come out and storm the streets. This
                        is one of those myths that goes around. In our time, we've really only had
                        about two. One was in Egypt when they burned the Shepherd's Hotel and the
                        other was in Iran. Maybe it's not the myth, but at least the specter of the
                        Arab mob is something that anybody who talks about the Middle East thinks,
                        that these are very volatile people and they really hate us. What were you
                        getting from the field and how were you translating it to the President, to
                        Congress, and elsewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>RUGH: We were trying to get as much specific detail as possible about not only
                    what the media were saying, but also what was happening in the streets. Our
                    public affairs officers and our staffs throughout the region were out and about
                    looking at the situation, engaging the situation. I remember on some occasions,
                    there would be a press report saying, “There is a mob in Cairo demonstrating
                    against American involvement in the crisis.” Our PAO would report from Cairo
                    that they had seen that mob and it was 100 people and there are that many
                    waiting for a bus every day in the middle of Cairo, so it was no big deal. So,
                    you put it in perspective. You put it in historical perspective and in the
                    context of what the political situation is in that particular country. Some
                    countries have more of a tradition of public riots and some don't. So, we tried
                    to gauge the public mood as best we could from all of those indicators. We put
                    those assessments into daily wrap ups that we sent to the Assistant Secretary of
                    State and on to others. They were usually two pages, which gave not only quotes
                    from editorials, but also information about public demonstrations and how we
                    assessed those, how serious they were. It varied from country to country. It was
                    a complicated situation. It varied from day to day. You don't generalize. But
                    one generalization that I recall was that those countries that were closest to
                    Iraq in the Arab world tended to be by far the most supportive of our effort,
                    with the exception of Jordan. Those countries that were further away, such as
                    Morocco or Tunisia, tended to have more editorial hostility to what we were
                    doing and more street demonstrations - possibly because of their remoteness from
                    the region, less appreciation of the threat that Saddam was posing to stability,
                    security, and Arab interests, and more susceptibility to Saddam's claims that he
                    was supporting Palestinian causes and Arab nationalism and more willingness to
                    accept some of the lies that he was putting out in his propaganda. For example,
                    Saddam said that there were American Christians defiling the holy places in
                    Mecca and Medina. It wasn't true. There weren't any American soldiers in Mecca
                    and Medina. The American military presence was mostly in the eastern province,
                    far away from Mecca and Medina. If you were a Saudi, you knew that. If you were
                    a Moroccan, you might not know that or might not believe the Voice of America.
                    You might believe Radio Baghdad just as well. So, we tried to gauge public
                    opinion as best we could.</p>
                <p>The Arab American community tended to have a higher percentage of critics of our
                    policy than the Arab world taken as a whole. There were lots of Iraqi-Americans
                    who were very upset that we were going into the Gulf, and Palestinian-Americans
                    as well. The support of the Chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, for Saddam
                    Hussein helped to encourage Palestinians both in the Middle East and in the
                    United States to be very critical of our policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was USIA using the Voice of America initially to focus on
                        Yemen, Palestine, Morocco, and Tunisia to get them to get on board or was it
                        more just a matter of giving out information?</hi>

                <p>RUGH: It was the latter. Our primary effort on the Voice of America, which has
                    two functions, one as a news service and one to present policy, was in the
                    policy sense to deal with the distortions and disinformation/misinformation
                    coming out of Baghdad. When there was an accusation that American troops were in
                    Mecca or, later, during the war, that we had bombed a civilian target in Iraq,
                    we tried to get out the denial and the correction as quickly as possible. VOA
                    was very responsive in doing that. Some of the Arab governments during the
                    crisis were not 100 percent satisfied with the VOA material, but I thought they
                    did a good job. The Saudis and some others have a different standard of
                    broadcast ethics. For example, when the VOA interviewed the Iraqi ambassador to
                    Washington, they got very upset. That was something that was debated within the
                    State Department and USIA. The Saudis thought that this was inappropriate and
                    some others did, too, but VOA thought it was news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about what you were doing regarding reporting on and
                        any direction towards Israel? A key factor in this whole thing was to make
                        sure that Israel kept out of the business. It is somewhat ironic when we
                        talk about our firmest ally in the Middle East and the one time when we
                        really got involved militarily, the whole thing was “Stay away. Don't do
                        anything. Keep down,” which was rather difficult. How did USIA deal with
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Indirectly. The effort was to show that the United States had overwhelming
                    power and if it came to a conflict, the Iraqis would not be able to do anything
                    militarily. This was not, therefore, a real threat to Israel. In private
                    discussions within the U.S. government, the issue came up in conversations that
                    I was involved in with respect to the following question: If Israel intervenes
                    in any way in this crisis directly, either by sending personnel to the Gulf or
                    by attacking Iraq militarily, what effect would that have on the Arab world's
                    support of the coalition? I argued in-house, within U.S. government circles,
                    that it would have a disastrous effect and that it would be very unwise to have
                    that happen. It would help undermine the coalition because it would help give
                    credence to Saddam's propaganda that this whole effort was just an Israeli
                    Trojan horse and that the Americans were only involved because of Israel. This
                    was not true, but if Israel became involved, which it didn't need to be, then it
                    would give some credence to Saddam's claim. It would also make it more difficult
                    for the Arabs to continue to support the coalition. The presence of Israeli
                    forces in the Gulf would be an embarrassment. The Saudis wanted to defend their
                    own territory and it was difficult enough for them to accept American troops. It
                    would have been impossible to accept Israeli troops. So, this was a crucial
                    issue. There was a diplomatic effort to persuade the Israelis to stay out and it
                    was successful.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leading up to the war, from the perspective of USIA and
                        particularly yours, could you talk about the role of the Cable News Network
                        (CNN)? Particularly when the war started, during the bombing, I was told
                        that in places in Africa, the government shut down. Around the world, people
                        were watching. So, this had a tremendous effect. How did you all see CNN and
                        its role during the buildup and thereafter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>RUGH: I have very mixed feelings about CNN. As an American who believes in free
                    press and free speech, I have to applaud any news organization that does more to
                    expand information and increase the amount of information available to the
                    world's public about what is going on. But I have to say that many of the CNN
                    reports during the crisis were misleading, were based on naive acceptance of
                    propaganda, were not properly checked out, and weren't helpful. I'm not saying
                    all of them were, but enough of them were so that it caused us concern. Peter
                    Arnett in particular was claiming to report the facts in Baghdad and he was
                    being fed Iraqi propaganda, which he swallowed without understanding what he was
                    being fed. He still to this day argues that he was right and the whole U.S.
                    government was wrong in some cases, particularly the famous baby milk factory
                    which supposedly was bombed. I heard him just as recently as this year stand up
                    before an international conference and say that he was right in that case. I'm
                    sure he was wrong. It wasn't a baby milk factory, but he still argues that it
                    was. He did us some harm by not being sufficiently skeptical and balanced. It
                    wasn't just a question of his being forced to say things because he was in
                    danger or threatened by the Iraqis. He was naive. He did us a disservice by
                    putting out Iraqi disinformation. He, on some occasions, would interview people
                    that he claimed were randomly selected people on the street who, in fact, were
                    Iraqi government information officials who gave him the party line. In addition
                    to that, every time he interviewed a genuine randomly selected person on the
                    street, that person for fear of his/her own life, would have to give the party
                    line. He didn't sufficiently convey that to the American public and to the
                    world's public. He was allowed to continue broadcasting in Baghdad. He says this
                    was because of the brilliance of his reporting. I think it was largely because
                    the Iraqis found him useful. He was more credible than Baghdad Radio. So, he was
                    used by the Iraqis. I'm not saying that all of his reporting was bad. Some of it
                    was okay. But there was an element there of distortion of the reality in favor
                    of Saddam Hussein that we had to deal with. We couldn't counter it. The American
                    government can't shut off CNN and we wouldn't have. It would have been against
                    our principles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't counter it. You can't go to the American public.
                        That is part of the ground rules for USIA. Did you find that USIA and its
                        subset, the Voice of America, was having to watch CNN and then go out with a
                        refutation of Peter Arnett or other people on CNN from time to time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, absolutely. I don't want to pick on CNN unnecessarily, but, yes, we
                    did have to do that. We had to do it for other distortions as well, coming from
                    other sources. So, we monitored CNN. We monitored all of the broadcasters and we
                    monitored Baghdad as well. The Voice of America carried corrections. When there
                    was something that was of major importance, we recommended to the spokesman of
                    the State Department that they deal with it. They often did. Or the Pentagon.
                    The Pentagon spokespeople were dealing with a lot of this as well. Part of our
                    problem in public diplomacy at USIA was getting our message into Iraq. The
                    Iraqis had (and still have) almost total control over information within Iraq.
                    CNN was not being seen in Iraq. Satellite dishes are not allowed in Iraq and
                    weren't then. The Voice of America signal, for technical reasons, was pretty
                    weak in Iraq. So, we spent a lot of time, effort, and money trying to enhance
                    the VOA signal into Iraq in various ways. But there were other audiences as well
                    that we were trying to reach with the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was USIA finding any particular areas around the world
                        where you felt maybe our support was getting weak or we had to be concerned
                        about, Europe, Russia, Japan, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We were primarily concerned about the immediate region. There was varied
                    support in other regions of the world. The Islamic world was important,
                    Indonesia and other countries were Islam is an important factor, but frankly, in
                    the last analysis, the most important areas in terms of public opinion on the
                    Gulf Crisis were the Arab states and Israel. After that, the Soviet Union and
                    the European states. But we knew we had to have the support of the Arab states
                    and Israel, at least the ones closest to the actual area of crisis in order for
                    the coalition to succeed. So, that was our area. I worked with the other area
                    directors in USIA on this question of the rest of the world. They were
                    supportive. We all met regularly and discussed strategy and worked it out. The
                    various departments of USIA, including VOA, the Television and Film Service, and
                    the media reaction people, were all very cooperative. We worked pretty well
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this whole period, were there any times of real
                        crisis that concerned you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>RUGH: There were several periods of crisis. I guess the time we were most nervous
                    was in January when the ultimatum deadline was coming due. War was about to
                    start and we didn't know how that was going to go. There were some other periods
                    that we were concerned about in terms of public diplomacy. One was the “baby
                    milk factory” and another was the bombing of a bunker in Baghdad, which the
                    Iraqis claimed was a civilian shelter and we said was a command post. That
                    attack caused us some bad press throughout the region and some bad public
                    reaction throughout the region. The Iraqis fairly successfully showed civilian
                    casualties. We were skeptical. We thought the Iraqis had staged that reaction.
                    But it was widely believed that we had attacked it. There were other charges
                    that we were bombing mosques and other civilian installations. We didn't and we
                    denied it, but it is hard to prove a negative. We did manage to obtain some
                    photographs from intelligence sources that showed Iraqis parking aircraft next
                    to mosques, which we managed to get declassified so that we could release them
                    and show that the Iraqis were trying to protect their military equipment by
                    hiding them next to mosques. That was helpful. So, there were periodic crises
                    and there was disinformation that would float around and we would try to chase
                    after it and deal with it. These came up practically every week.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left this job in 1992. After the war, was there any
                        particular emphasis? The war was over at the end of February 1991.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The next major issue that we were dealing with was a follow-on to one of
                    our problems in the Gulf Crisis. That was the question of the Arab-Israeli
                    conflict. During the crisis before the war, Saddam tried to arouse Arab
                    hostility to the United States and to the coalition by talking about the
                    Palestinians. In the middle of the crisis, there was an incident in Jerusalem
                    that helped him in that regard. Saddam said, “Let's put these two issues
                    together, have a big conference, and settle both Palestine and Kuwait together.”
                    The President refused. He said, “These are two separate issues. We have to deal
                    with Kuwait and after that issue is over, we will deal with Arab-Israel.” A lot
                    of people didn't believe that. They said, “Oh, he just doesn't want to deal with
                    Arab-Israel.” In fact, to his credit, President Bush, right after the Gulf
                    Crisis was over, said, “Alright, let's deal with Arab-Israel.” Secretary Baker,
                    President Bush, and his team put together an effort which led to the Madrid
                    Conference of 1991 within six months of the end of the Gulf Crisis. This started
                    us on the path to what I think will be a resolution of the Arab-Israeli crisis
                    eventually. It doesn't look very good right now, but it was a start. The Madrid
                    Conference was the focus of our attention between the end of the Gulf Crisis in
                    1991 and the time I left in 1992.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>RUGH: It was terrific. It was a wonderful step forward. We were very relieved
                    that, finally, progress was being made that was on a comprehensive level. Camp
                    David back in 1978-1979 and the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement had been just
                    with Egypt. Now, the Madrid Conference included literally the entire Arab world.
                    That was a wonderful positive step forward in the peace process. We were all
                    very gratified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Madrid Conference, were there special efforts to
                        bring both the Arab world and Israel into line and we were serious about
                        this, that this was not just another thing? Was there something concrete
                        that you could hang onto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: At USIA, we did everything we could to support the Madrid Conference. It
                    was a diplomatic event. It was an event that was managed, organized, and
                    implemented by the State Department with the support of the White House, so we
                    didn't have a leading role in it by any means. But we directed a lot of our
                    effort to publicizing it, to supporting it, and to portraying it as a positive
                    step forward. We made the point in editorials that President Bush had kept his
                    word and had not ignored the Arab-Israeli conflict during the Gulf Crisis. He
                    had promised to deal with it afterwards and he did. So, that was a very helpful
                    point that we made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression from the polls you were taking
                        and from the reports you were getting from embassies about the Arab mood
                        after the Gulf War and the beginning of this Israeli-Palestinian peace
                        process up to the time you left the job in 1992?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Among the Arab states, there was still some residue left over from the Gulf
                    Crisis because Saddam was still in power. We thought he would leave power. It
                    turns out he didn't. We thought he would fall after that crisis. There was still
                    resentment by the Gulf states against Jordan and Yemen for being on the wrong
                    side. That colored their relationship. That wasn't directly our business, but it
                    was something that affected the climate in the region. We were trying to focus
                    on the peace process, but the Gulf states were primarily concerned about
                    cleaning up the aftermath of the Gulf Crisis. There was a focus by the Gulf
                    states on Iran. The threat that they perceived from Iran had been temporarily
                    overshadowed by the threat from Iraq, but now they remembered it and focused on
                    it again. So the concerns were varied. There were other local issues.</p>
                <p>The Gulf Crisis was so overwhelming that it sort of dominated everything
                    throughout the Middle East and North Africa, but when it was over, people
                    remembered there were other problems. In Algeria, there were internal problems.
                    Morocco and Algeria had border problems. The Palestinian area was again focused
                    primarily on the Arab-Israeli question. But further afield, people were looking
                    at economic and other issues that again became much more diverse.</p>

                <p>RUGH: There were some in the region who saw the United States as being hostile to
                    Islam because of American concern or worry about fundamentalism. We tried to
                    correct that misimpression. One Assistant Secretary of State, Ed Djerejian, made
                    an important speech at Meridian House during this period in which he clearly
                    stated the official American position as being hostile only to extremism, not to
                    Islam - extremism in any form, whether it's Islamic or other - and the use of
                    violent means, that Americans are not anti-Islamic by any means and are, in
                    fact, respectful of Islamic traditions. We tried to get that message out. That
                    particular speech was very important. We used that as much as we could. It helps
                    to repeat that. It's not enough just to say it once, so we tried to keep that
                    going.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In an interview I did rather recently with David Mack,
                        also an Arabist, he was saying that he went to a meeting around this time in
                        Europe and was amazed to find that the Europeans much more than the
                        Americans were talking as though Islamic hordes were at the gates of Vienna
                        and Tours. They were talking about, now that the Cold War is over, Islam is
                        perhaps going to be the enemy. Did you see any manifestations of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, I think particularly in France there is the strong feeling. They have
                    their own special experience with many guest workers and with the association
                    with North Africa and particularly Algeria. The French don't know how to deal
                    with Algeria. It's close by and they're concerned about it. I think the Algerian
                    situation focuses their attention on it more than on others. There is a lot of
                    misunderstanding of Islam around the world and some difficulty in knowing how to
                    deal with it. Even among smart American academics, there is a lot of debate.</p>

                <p>RUGH: In 1992, I went out as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Ambassadorial assignments are always a mysterious process. I was interested
                    in doing another ambassadorship because I had such a nice experience in Yemen in
                    the 1980s. Obviously, it is an honor and a privilege to run an embassy, even a
                    small one. In talking to my friends in the State Department when I said I would
                    like to be a candidate to be an ambassador, they said, “You're not a candidate.
                    Nobody is a candidate. You don't apply for the job. You get chosen.”</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is one of the great misstatements of all time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right, so I ignored that and lobbied a little bit with my friends. There is
                    a lot of luck involved. I was fortunate to be in a position in 1990-1991 where I
                    had a lot of exposure to senior people in the State Department who later in 1992
                    had something to do with my assignment as ambassador. That was because I was
                    director of the Near East and South Asia Bureau of USIA. Saddam's invasion of
                    Kuwait came along in August 1990. Between August 1990 and through the following
                    year until the spring of 1991, I had a lot of contact at senior levels in the
                    State Department, including the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Bob
                    Kimmitt. I attended a lot of his morning meetings in which he discussed strategy
                    and tactics to deal with Saddam. I was able to speak up and represent USIA at
                    those meetings. I was the co-chair of a task force dealing with public diplomacy
                    at the State Department. It was an interagency group. Every week I attended the
                    NEA Assistant Secretary's meetings at State and got to know the Assistant
                    Secretary well and speak up and give him some useful material from USIA
                    sources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: John Kelly (during the Crisis). So, he got to know me. He started the
                    nomination process. He sent my name up to the seventh floor. He said he believed
                    in the principle of having agencies other than the State Department represented
                    in the ambassadorial ranks, so that helped that he believed in that. So, when he
                    sent up a list of nominees for NEA ambassadorships, he put my name on it for the
                    UAE. When it came to Bob Kimmitt, he knew me from those meetings. There were
                    some others who knew me also, so that didn't hurt. I don't know if it helped or
                    not, but I had had a couple of encounters with the President during the Gulf
                    Crisis in the Oval Office and with the NSC staff. Richard Haass was the senior
                    Near East NSC person then. I don't know if he was involved in the process, but
                    he knew me and had selected me to meet with the President on two occasions. So,
                    just by good luck during the period prior to when I was ready to make another
                    move, I had been exposed to these folks. So, that is really how it happened. I
                    had Arabic, had been ambassador before, and had served in the area. All of those
                    things helped. I don't know who else was on the list.</p>

                <p>RUGH: Right, exactly.</p>

                <p>RUGH: Right. It's not Paris or London, so the competition is from other career
                    people and from State Department people who are good people and very talented.
                    Sitting in USIA, you always think State Department people have an advantage in
                    getting ambassadorships and they probably do, but I was lucky and I got it.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: From the fall of 1992 until the summer of 1995.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out there, what initiatives or goals were
                        you putting in your mental attach� case about what needed to be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The relationship with the UAE since the Gulf Crisis (after 1991 when the
                    war was over) had become a very heavily military one. I thought it was important
                    to do two things. One was to solidify that military relationship. In the past,
                    the Gulf countries and, in fact, all of the Arab countries, have been reluctant
                    to have any military bases or any close association with American military. I
                    knew that bases still were not possible, but I thought that it would be
                    important to work closely with the American military and help them develop the
                    closest possible relationship with the UAE because the danger still remained.
                    Iran was still a threat and Iraq was still a threat because Saddam was still in
                    power. So, I thought that high on my agenda would be the role of the U.S.
                    military in dealing with that, which I hadn't dealt with in Yemen very much as
                    ambassador because it was a very small part of our mission.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I thought it would be important to expand the relationship beyond the
                    military because it was so heavily military already that it needed some other
                    aspects. So, both of those goals: solidifying the military relationship and
                    expanding it into other areas (economic, commercial, and cultural) and take
                    advantage of America's prestige from the Gulf Crisis in ways that could help
                    American companies on the commercial side. America had not been a major economic
                    player in the UAE; the British had. It was a British domain and it still was
                    even after the British left in 1971.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What comprised the UAE? What was the government structures
                        and political forces there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>RUGH: The UAE is a small country. It used to be called “Trucial States” when
                    Britain was running their foreign affairs and defense up until 1971 when it
                    became independent. Seven small emirates combine in a federation. The largest,
                    richest, and most powerful emirate was Abu Dhabi. The second largest and richest
                    was Dubai. There were five others. These seven emirates were located on the
                    Persian Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz. They were and are economically very
                    important because of their huge petroleum reserves. They have about 100 billion
                    barrels of petroleum reserves, which is four times what we have in North
                    America. Their oil policy was very moderate and prudent and they basically
                    recycled their oil revenues into investments in the United States and elsewhere,
                    so the petrodollars were very important to us.</p>
                <p>In addition to the economic interests for the United States, they also occupied a
                    very important piece of real estate on the Persian Gulf and also there is a
                    piece of the UAE which is on the Indian Ocean. So, from a strategic point of
                    view, the U.S. military looked at the UAE as very important territory for us.
                    For example, if the Strait of Hormuz were closed and bottling up the Persian
                    Gulf, if the UAE were friendly, the U.S. still could have access to the Persian
                    Gulf through the Indian Ocean side. There is an airfield in Fujairah on the
                    Indian Ocean side where the U.S. Navy brings in people and supplies on a regular
                    basis in quiet times. If there were a crisis, that would become very important,
                    providing us very easy air access to the Persian Gulf to supply the fleet. You
                    have to remember that there were, on an average, 20 American naval vessels in
                    the Persian Gulf at any one time, including from time to time a carrier task
                    force. This was a very important commitment of American military personnel and
                    equipment to peacekeeping in the Persian Gulf. The lines keeping contact with
                    those ships were important. A lot of that went through the UAE, including to the
                    airfields. We never had an airbase there. We still don't. But they were open to
                    us. For example, when we were flying Southern Watch (We're still doing that.),
                    which is the air flights of U.S. military planes over southern Iraq to maintain
                    the sanctions on Iraq. The Southern Watch missions had to be fueled by U.S.
                    tanker planes called KC-10s. These KC-10s were based in the UAE in airfields. We
                    couldn't have flown those missions over southern Iraq without basing these
                    planes in the UAE. Although there wasn't an American base there, it was through
                    the UAE we were allowed to do that. That was something useful to the military,
                    so that was important.</p>
                <p>In addition, American exports to the UAE had grown over the years so that it had
                    become an important market. In fact, it is an entrep�t. Dubai in particular had
                    become an entrep�t for South Asia and for the Arab world. Really in the last
                    decade, Dubai has taken over the role of Bahrain as the entrep�t, transit point,
                    and most active and vibrant commercial center of the entire Gulf. Dubai has the
                    largest man-made port in the world, Jebel Ali, with a free port, an aluminum
                    plant, and a lot of commercial activities. A lot of American companies went into
                    the free port and went into Dubai and used Dubai as a transit point for
                    shipments all over the world. Dubai merchants are very clever and very
                    experienced and have really taken advantage of opportunities in the last few
                    years.</p>

                        my time as commercial officer in the Gulf from 1958-1960. You would go to
                        Dubai and you would see four men carrying one very small box.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That is still true. Smuggling and commerce. From Dubai's point of view,
                    it's commerce. Smuggling is sort of a pejorative term. In Dubai, you don't have
                    to smuggle because everything is tax free and free trade prevails. They have
                    almost zero duties and controls over what you can bring in and bring out, so you
                    bring in large amounts of gold to Dubai and you resell it to Indians,
                    Pakistanis, Saudis, people from all over the world. People from Europe go to
                    Dubai to buy European made gold because it's cheaper. For some of those
                    countries, it's not legal to bring in gold without paying a tax, but for Dubai
                    it's perfectly legal to export it without paying a tax so that they benefit by
                    people taking a risk in their own home countries. There is a lot of smuggling of
                    other things that goes on between Dubai and Iran. There are boats that go every
                    day from Dubai across to Iran and evade the Iranian customs people and go into
                    Iran bringing goods and come out of Iran bringing carpets, pistachios, and so
                    on. It's only 50 miles across the water, so it is a very active trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain the government situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The government is legally and constitutionally headed by a council of the
                    seven emirs, the seven sheikhs who rule each of the seven Emirates. So, it is as
                    if in the United States that the governor's conference of 50 governors would get
                    together and run the country. That is the theory in the UAE. In practice, Sheikh
                    Zayid, who is the ruler of Abu Dhabi, is really in charge, certainly of foreign
                    affairs and defense policy. He has much more weight in national decisions than
                    any other ruler because of the wealth and size of Abu Dhabi Emirate. Sheikh
                    Zayid was one of the founders of the UAE in 1971 and is now about 80 years old.
                    He is universally respected as a leader. He has enormous charisma. Everybody in
                    the UAE looks up to him. He is sort of the George Washington, the founding
                    father who is holding the country together by force of his personality. There
                    was another major figure, Sheikh Rashid of Dubai, who was almost as powerful, as
                    prominent, and as respected as Sheikh Zayid at the time of the founding, but he
                    died a few years ago, so that leaves Sheikh Zayid as the towering figure in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Formally, the seven rulers get together and discuss national policy on a regular
                    basis, but major decisions like whether to allow the Americans to base their
                    aircraft in the UAE, those were made by Sheikh Zayid and his family, his sons.
                    His sons have become very prominent. One of his sons is the Chief of Staff of
                    the armed forces. Another is the head of the Security Service. Another is the
                    number two in the Foreign Ministry. Another runs the Ports Authority. So, his
                    sons are being groomed to succeed him.</p>

                <p>RUGH: Some of them have, yes. The Chief of Staff, Sheikh Mohammad, has had
                    military training at Sandhurst in the UK. Some of his other sons who have been
                    trained in the United States have gone to school here. His oldest son, who is in
                    his late 40s, had a traditional education, has not been trained abroad. The rest
                    of his sons have had training abroad.</p>

                    The United States saw and sees Iran as the overwhelming threat to the region.
                    So, we had a parallel of interests. I was fortunate to be there at a time when
                    the leadership in Abu Dhabi and in Washington really had a threat perception
                    that was similar. The second most important threat as seen by both countries was
                    Iraq. Again, we had a parallel threat assessment. As time went on, the
                    perception of the Iraqi threat began to change a bit. In the UAE, the leadership
                    as time went on began to become very uncomfortable with the status quo. Saddam
                    Hussein stayed in power. The embargo was hurting the Iraqi people very badly and
                    not hurting Saddam. The United States takes the lead in the embargo against
                    Saddam. We had expected Saddam to fall and be replaced by a more benign Iraqi
                    leadership. Everybody had expected that. It didn't happen. We continued our
                    policy of a tough embargo on Iraq. The UAE continued to support it, but became
                    increasingly worried that it wasn't doing the job, that it wasn't bringing about
                    a change of behavior in the Iraqi leadership and the departure of Saddam. They
                    didn't have an alternative to suggest. They weren't saying, “You ought to stop
                    the embargo and do the following.” They wanted us to keep up the pressure on
                    Saddam, but they felt the pressure wasn't on Saddam; it was on the Iraqi people.
                    So, at the end of my tour, by 1995, there began to be a discussion over “What
                    are you going to do about Saddam and why haven't you gotten rid of him? Why are
                    you punishing the Iraqi people?” Well, we weren't intentionally punishing the
                    Iraqi people. In Washington and the American embassy, we felt that Saddam was
                    the one who was punishing the Iraqi people. So, in terms of threat perception,
                    both Washington and Abu Dhabi continued to believe that Saddam was the problem,
                    but the solution that we were applying, namely a total embargo, pressure on
                    Saddam, a no fly zone in the south, and support for the Kurds in the north,
                    wasn't bringing relief for the Iraqi people. That hurt Sheikh Zayid. As an Arab,
                    he felt a lot of sympathy for the suffering of the Iraqi people. So, that
                    continues to this day, a discussion along the lines of Zayid and his people
                    saying “What are you going to do to fix the Iraqi situation” and us saying
                    “Well, it's Saddam's fault.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Always with an embargo, which seems to be the weapon of
                        choice of the United States, what you do is, you put an embargo on and hope
                        somebody will depose the leader. We're doing this in Bosnia, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Or change the policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has proved to be extremely ineffective. What had the
                        UAE done during the Gulf War? What was their participation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: UAE was very supportive of the allied position during the Gulf War. It was
                    part of the coalition against Saddam Hussein. Thousands of American troops were
                    allowed to have access to the UAE. Aircraft were stationed in the UAE. UAE
                    hospitality was total in terms of providing support for the American military
                    effort. The UAE provided some military forces for the coalition. So, it was a
                    very strong support. Even before Saddam invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the
                    UAE, I think, perceived almost before anybody else that there was a real crisis.
                    The Saudis and the Kuwaitis thought that Saddam was bluffing, and we thought
                    Saddam was bluffing. He never would invade all of Kuwait. Sheikh Zayid in July
                    1990 asked us to conduct a military exercise, an air exercise, a joint exercise,
                    between UAE Air Force and the United States Air Force as a demonstration of
                    American willingness to support the UAE in a time of crisis. That was quite
                    perceptive. It didn't stop Saddam from invading Kuwait, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact, he got kind of annoyed about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. He was very upset with the UAE in particular. To my mind, it shows
                    that Sheikh Zayid had an instinct and a feeling that something terrible was
                    happening and we needed to draw the line. As I say, it didn't stop Saddam, but
                    it showed Sheikh Zayid's concern. He was totally against Saddam's invasion of
                    Kuwait and totally in support of the effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the influence of Iran? I know in Bahrain, one
                        of the problems has been the Shias have been coming in, which has turned
                        into sort of a disruptive force on Bahrain. This is not just recently, but
                        has been going on over the centuries. Has the UAE had that same
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>RUGH: The demographics in the UAE are very interesting. The total resident
                    population in the UAE is just over two million. The number of UAE nationals, UAE
                    citizens, is about 400,000 out of that two million. That means foreigners living
                    in the UAE make up 80 percent of the population. They are not given citizenship.
                    It is not a melting pot. They don't believe that these people should stay around
                    after they finish working, but they're very hospitable to them while they're
                    there working. So, these are guest workers whether they're Indians, who are
                    about 450,000 and Pakistanis, who are about 350,00. There are more Indians than
                    UAE nationals. Or they are Americans, Brits, or Bangladeshis, etc. They are all
                    there temporarily. When they're finished working, they are to leave. So, that is
                    an odd and unusual arrangement because there are so many foreigners living
                    there. Among those foreigners are more than 60,000 Iranians. Those Iranians are
                    mostly in Dubai. Many of them are working in business and commerce, working as
                    laborers, or working in fishing and so on. Among those 60,000 Iranians are, we
                    believe, a number of Iranian intelligence officers from the MOIS (Ministry of
                    Intelligence and Security, Iran). They are there under cover of business or
                    other types of employment that attempt to disguise their true intent, but they
                    are there for purposes of surveillance and watching, watching the UAE,
                    collecting data, collecting intelligence, and they are a potential fifth column.
                    Certainly the ones who work for the Iranian government could cause trouble.
                    There have been some incidents in the past involving those Iranian agents
                    directed, however, against other Iranians. There was one incident where they
                    kidnapped an Iran dissident in Dubai and bundled him off to Iran. They have the
                    potential of causing trouble. The UAE security authorities keep a close watch on
                    them. We try to keep a watch on the Iranians. In fact, since we don't have an
                    embassy in Teheran, we tend to do a little bit of reporting on Iranians who come
                    to our consulate and apply for visas, as they do in large numbers. But the most
                    active Iran watchers in the UAE are UAE authorities themselves. They keep very
                    close tabs on them. The UAE doesn't have a very strong, tight border. It doesn't
                    have much of a coast guard. So, it's very easy for Iranians to slip into the
                    country. They can come over in a small boat and get in without any trouble.
                    Sometimes residence permits and work permits are sold by various authorities.
                    So, you can slip into the country and this is a potential security problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>In addition to those 60,000 Iranian nationals who live in the UAE out of a
                    resident population of only two million, there are thousands of UAE nationals
                    who have as their national origin southern Iran. Arab tribes and Arab peoples of
                    southern Iran immigrated to the UAE (then the Trucial States) over the centuries
                    and make up a sizeable number of the population, particularly of Dubai. Some of
                    them still speak Farsi or a version of Farsi. Many of them are in business. Some
                    of them even speak Farsi at home. But they consider themselves Iranian
                    nationals. They are full-fledged UAE citizens and they have citizenship because
                    their grandparents were there forever, but they really are sort of a class by
                    themselves. They have Iranian connections. These are the people who are most
                    effective in maintaining trade between Dubai and Iran. They have family ties.
                    They speak Farsi. They know people back in the village and in the cities of
                    southern Iran. So, they have old commercial connections with Iran and they keep
                    the trade going very nicely. So, it's a very mixed population. Why isn't there
                    more conflict between ethnic groups? Why isn't there unrest among the
                    foreigners? I think the simple answer is prosperity. Every one of the foreigners
                    working there is earning more money than they would be earning back home. The
                    Indians and Pakistanis in particular are really well off compared to what they
                    would be making back at home.</p>
                <p>There was an incident while I was there, a spillover from a problem in India. A
                    mosque in Ayodhya India was attacked and destroyed in 1993 or 1994. Muslims in
                    India were very upset about it. Indian and Pakistani Muslims living in the UAE
                    also were upset about it. There were some incidents for about two days in the
                    UAE, demonstrations and clashes between Indians and Pakistanis. This only lasted
                    two days. It lasted much longer in India. This was because the UAE rounded up
                    some of the troublemakers, put them on a plane, sent them back home, and they
                    realized that they had lost their jobs. Immediately word spread that if you made
                    trouble over Ayodhya, you were going to be deported and you would lose your job.
                    That stopped it cold. So, the people there realized that if they got into any
                    political demonstrations or involved in anything other than just making a living
                    and keeping quiet, they would be deported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, or prior to when you were there, did
                        Iran make any geographic demands on the UAE?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. That is an important point. Iran and the UAE both lay claim to three
                    small islands. One is called Abu Musa and the other two are the Greater and
                    Lesser Tunbs. These are tiny islands, only five or six miles wide. But they lie
                    exactly in the Middle of the Persian Gulf halfway between Iran and the UAE. In
                    1971, just hours before the UAE became independent, when the British were still
                    in charge, Iran forcibly occupied the Two Tunbs, which had been Arab islands all
                    along, and took over Abu Musa as well. Abu Musa was regulated by a memorandum of
                    understanding between the Shah and the UAE, which said that the sovereignty will
                    be put aside and this Abu Musa island will be divided administratively between
                    Iran and the UAE. After that 1971 memorandum of understanding, which the UAE
                    didn't like because they thought all Abu Musa was their island, the Iranians
                    gradually militarized all three islands. Particularly during the Iran-Iraq War,
                    they put garrisons up. In 1991, the UAE said, “Halt. You're talking over our
                    island. You're militarizing Abu Musa and the Tunbs you stole from us. We want
                    them back.” Since 1991, there has been an ongoing dispute in public in the UN in
                    every forum that the UAE goes to, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council,
                    etc. Every time they make a speech, they say, “These three islands are Arab.
                    They're ours. Iran has been taking them over gradually, annexing them. We
                    object. We want to go to the international court. We want to go to the UN
                    mediation. We have legality on our side.” Why are they making such a big issue
                    over these tiny islands? There is a little bit of oil, but it's really symbolic.
                    Sheikh Zayid and the UAE leadership are afraid that if they make concessions and
                    allow Iran to take over these three little islands at the midline of the Gulf,
                    then Iran will not hesitate to try to take over more islands. Half of the UAE's
                    oil reserves are offshore on other islands close to these three. So, the UAE is
                    afraid that Iran will have an appetite for more islands with more oil if they
                    don't draw a line and say “Halt.” So, this has been an ongoing dispute. The UAE
                    has the backing of practically everybody in the world and Iran doesn't, but Iran
                    is not giving up its de facto hold on these islands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we get involved in that at all? We had no relations
                        with Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We have been asked from time to time what is our position on the islands.
                    We have said that we recommend a peaceful settlement of the dispute. We have
                    never been asked which side do we come down on. I don't know what we would say
                    if we were asked. My personal opinion is that the UAE legal case is much
                    stronger than the Iranian case. The Iranians have been there really only since
                    1971 and they occupied two of them by force. But we have never been asked that.
                    The British have been asked. The British were very much involved. They allowed
                    it to happen. They allowed Iran to take over these three islands. The UAE wants
                    the British to say that this was a mistake and “We have right on our side.” When
                    I was there, the UAE asked the British ambassador for the documents. He dragged
                    his feet. He didn't want to give them the documents. He didn't want to get
                    involved. He said, “It's your dispute. This is an old story.” But the British
                    were culpable. The British were responsible for allowing it to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues you dealt with and how did you
                        deal with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>RUGH: One of the main issues was sort of a technical one, but it had a lot of
                    symbolism. There was a request by the U.S. government to sign a defense
                    cooperation agreement with the UAE. This request goes back to the end of the
                    Saddam crisis in 1991. As soon as this crisis with Saddam, Desert Storm, was
                    over, we decided that we wanted defense cooperation agreements with all of the
                    Arab states in the Gulf, all six of the GCC states, and we got one immediately
                    with Kuwait. We got one rather promptly with Bahrain. We already had one with
                    Oman. We got one rather promptly with Qatar. The Saudis said they really didn't
                    need one because we had close cooperation. That left the UAE as the one country
                    besides the Saudis that had not signed a defense agreement. We requested it
                    immediately. It was taken under advisement. When I got there in 1992, there had
                    been a year and a half of discussion of the agreement, but it hadn't been
                    concluded. I spent two years working on that and finally did sign a defense
                    cooperation agreement before I left. It was a problem for them because we were
                    asking them to give up a portion of their sovereignty. It was a Status of Forces
                    Agreement which said that an American military person who commits a crime in UAE
                    territory would be handed over to the United States for trial, not to the UAE.
                    Under normal international law, the crime would be tried under UAE law. We were
                    saying, “No, hand him over to us.” So, for example, if a sailor off an American
                    ship kills a UAE national, he is not tried in a UAE court. He is tried by an
                    American court martial. We were asking for that. They had trouble accepting
                    that. They said, “This could cause political problems and this is difficult for
                    us to swallow.” We had long discussions and a lot of delegations that came out.
                    I spent a lot of time on it. Finally, we persuaded them that in the context of
                    everything that we were doing to provide security for the UAE and the other
                    countries of the Gulf, this was something that they could give us and they did
                    do it. But, frankly, they weren't happy about it. Particularly the folks in
                    Dubai, where most of the American sailors are on leave, said, “We don't need
                    this. We are hospitable. If anything goes wrong, don't worry. We're friendly to
                    Americans. Nothing will happen.” Well, the lawyers in the Pentagon didn't
                    believe that. So, we had literal-minded lawyers in the Pentagon versus tribal
                    chiefs in Dubai having different views of what would happen if an American
                    sailor killed somebody. The tribal leaders said, “Don't worry, we'll take care
                    of it. There may be a brief period where this guy is locked up, but we'll deal
                    with it because we like Americans.” That wasn't enough for the lawyers in the
                    Pentagon. They said, “No, we've got to have something in writing.”</p>

                        person out of the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: That's right. There were a few people in the Pentagon, bless them, who
                    understood the situation in the region. I think General Joe Hoar, who was the
                    Commander in CENTCOM (United States Central Command) during most of the time I
                    was out there, was one of them. He really understood and he was not pushing. He
                    said, “Don't twist their arm. If you have to twist their arm the agreement won't
                    be worth anything. If they want to sign it, if they know what they're doing and
                    they're happy with signing it, fine. But we don't want an agreement that they
                    will sign under duress.” There were others. We found a few lawyers in the
                    Pentagon who were able to talk to people out there, but it wasn't easy. The
                    State Department was supportive, but the Pentagon regarded this as their issue.
                    They sent their lawyers out and they were hardliners. So, it was tough. To tell
                    you the truth, after I signed the agreement, we had difficulty implementing it.
                    The implementation phase of it lasted for quite a while. It wasn't really
                    implemented until quite a while after I signed it. The story wasn't over when I
                    signed it, even though I thought it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said that one of the things you wanted to achieve was
                        to strengthen the military relationship, which I assume that part of the
                        baggage you had to do would be this Status of Forces Agreement. How did the
                        rest of this come across on the military side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The other major issue on the military side was sales of military equipment
                    and services and joint exercises. The joint exercises were fairly easy to work
                    out. The sales of equipment was tougher. I and Washington believed that American
                    military equipment was the best in the world. The UAE was not automatically
                    signing up to every deal that was proposed. They were taking a lot of time. They
                    were looking at French, British, and even Russian equipment. So, I spent a lot
                    of my time trying to advise and counsel American companies, the Pentagon, the
                    Department of Commerce, and everybody else who got involved on military sales.
                    There was one major one that we lost. The UAE bought over 300 main battle tanks.
                    I thought it would be fairly easy to sell the M 1, which had won the Gulf War,
                    to the UAE. The French came along and made an offer which had a lot of claims in
                    it. It hadn't been built yet. It was a paper tank. The UAE bought it. I think
                    that the French didn't tell the truth in their sales pitch and we did. In
                    addition, the French offered them an offset program which was required in the
                    sale, which was much more attractive than our offset program. So, the French
                    tank won a multibillion dollar sale and we lost it.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>There is another contract that is still being considered that was active when I
                    arrived in 1992 and was active when I left in 1995 and has still not been
                    concluded. That is the fighter aircraft. The UAE wants to buy 30-60 fighter
                    aircraft. I thought when I arrived that this was an easy sale because McDonnell
                    Douglas makes a wonderful F-15 and Lockheed makes a wonderful F-16 and who can
                    match that? Well, the Russians had some MIGs and the French had some Mirage and
                    other planes. The British had some planes. It was by no means an easy sell. It
                    is still not decided. As we speak, the UAE has narrowed the sale down to
                    Lockheed plus a European competitor and it's still not concluded. This is long
                    after I thought it would have been concluded. So, that was tough. We spent a lot
                    of time trying to help the American companies with this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that after the Gulf War, where American
                        equipment had demonstrated its superiority, that our selling people the
                        equipment had maybe lost their edge as far as being good salesmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. They're not used to selling to people in the Arab world. They don't
                    have the patience. They don't have knowledge of the thought patterns of Arab
                    officials. The French and British have a lot more experience with selling in the
                    Arab world. Plus, frankly, the French and the British had a lot more direct
                    government support. We tried at the embassy to give the companies as much
                    support as we could, but the British embassy got Prince Charles and Diana, the
                    Defense Minister, the Foreign Minister, and Margaret Thatcher, and all these
                    people to come out to the UAE regularly and make high level visits and see the
                    President. They got treated royally. By the way, they were selling British goods
                    and services. The French did the same thing. The French Prime Minister, Foreign
                    Minister, and Defense Minister all came out. They invited them back. When they
                    went to Paris, middle level officials going to Paris would see the Defense
                    Minister. They would come to Washington and try to see the American Secretary of
                    Defense and you can't get in the door unless you're of equal rank. So, that
                    helped the Europeans and it hurt us. Americans wanted to sell. As a matter of
                    policy, we increasingly were told by the State Department that trade is
                    important, but we weren't able to match the European political effort. Frankly,
                    there is a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States which prevents
                    American companies from paying bribes and the French don't have anything like
                    that. That makes a difference. All of those factors made it difficult for us. We
                    argued quality. We said, “You get what we say you're going to get. The French
                    don't always deliver on their promises.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been true even back when I was in Athens in the
                        early 1970s with the Greek government. The French were loading up the deal
                        with all sorts of things, but the equipment really is isn't that good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. As people say, the French will sell you something and forget to add
                    in spares and say, “Oh, you want spares?” Spares are automatically included in
                    our package, as is maintenance and all kinds of things. We just give a better
                    deal.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>The other problem is releasability. We have some special equipment on our
                    aircraft that the UAE wants. They want the best. They want everything that we
                    have - radars, and so on. The Pentagon doesn't release all of that to everybody.
                    They may release it to nobody, they may release it only to NATO, or they may
                    release it to NATO and Israel, but not anybody else. That sticks in the craw of
                    people in the UAE who say, “We're a cash customer. We're ready to pay you for
                    this. We want top of the line. We don't want second-rate stuff that isn't the
                    best.” Congress gets involved and you have to get the Pentagon to release the
                    stuff. Sometimes, people in the Pentagon at the highest levels say, “We haven't
                    given it to Israel, so we can't give it to you” or “We just gave it to Israel
                    and Israel needs a qualitative edge, so we won't give it to the UAE.” That
                    doesn't go down very well in the UAE.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself getting into arguments or trying to
                        work with the Pentagon and also with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Yes, we worked with the Pentagon. We pointed out the material advantages of
                    making the sale, the income, and the job creation. In addition, there was the
                    interoperability. The Pentagon likes the argument of interoperability. That is
                    to say, if the UAE has American equipment, that if we go to war again, you can
                    work more closely with the UAE military because they have the same equipment.
                    So, interoperability was an argument we made to the UAE, but we also made it to
                    the Pentagon to encourage them. Of course, the American companies were lobbying
                    the Pentagon, the White House, and the State Department to get support, but they
                    didn't always have that much clout, as much as one imagines they do. In
                    comparison to the French and the British, there is a much tighter relationship
                    between business and government than there is in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other side, of increasing ties and
                        influence on the non-military side? How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>RUGH: That didn't progress as far as I had hoped. The overwhelming character of
                    the relationship was military. I had hoped that there would be more political
                    connections, more State Department connections, and more Department of Commerce
                    connections with the UAE. In my time, we got very few visits from any
                    non-military people. We had general officers every month coming up from the
                    Pentagon and from CENTCOM. We had colonels and majors there every day visiting
                    us. We had thousands and thousands of troops coming in for port calls. So, the
                    American military connection with the UAE in terms of visits, personnel,
                    connections, conferences, discussions, and consultations was enormous, whereas
                    the connections on the political side were fairly weak. In my time, the
                    Assistant Secretary of State came twice. We had the Secretary of Transportation,
                    Mr. Pena, come, but we didn't get anybody else really of a senior political
                    nature who came out and had serious discussions with the UAE leadership. We had
                    one Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Peter Tarnoff, come. But we never got
                    the Secretary of State. We certainly never got the President or Vice President.
                    In contrast to the Europeans, we didn't have that kind of high level visibility.
                    I was disappointed that we didn't have more of a political dialogue with the
                    UAE. They wanted it. They resented the lack of it. We would send envoys out to
                    ask for money. We would send a special envoy to see Sheikh Zayid and say, “We
                    have a project in North Korea to help persuade the Koreans to stop building
                    nuclear weapons. Will you pay for it?” Well, they would get a puzzled look from
                    the UAE officials, who would say, “What does this have to do with us?” Well, the
                    only thing that it had to do with them was that they had a lot of money. We were
                    carrying a tin cup to collect money. I had to try to persuade the people that
                    were visiting to try to make a link between North Korea and the UAE to put a
                    good face on it to make the people think that we weren't just coming because
                    they were rich. But we were, frankly, in many cases. We hit them for money for
                    the Palestinians, which is a little bit more logical. We pressed them hard for
                    money for Turkey, for the Palestinians, and for a whole list of other causes
                    just because they had money. So, we tended only to show up when we wanted money
                    and not when we wanted a serious political dialogue. That was a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had been dealing with the State Department and
                        American administrations over a long period of time. Did you have a feeling
                        that when the Clinton administration came in in 1993 that it really had very
                        little interest in the Middle East, except for the normal Israeli
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>RUGH: Right. That is true. Secretary Christopher spent a lot of time working on
                    the peace process. He shuttled back and forth to Syria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan,
                    even Lebanon. He never came to Abu Dhabi. I think he went once to Kuwait, but
                    occasionally, he would come to Saudi Arabia and announce that he was visiting
                    the Gulf. People in Abu Dhabi didn't think he was visiting them. Saudi Arabia is
                    part of the Gulf, but it's only one country. It is the biggest, wealthiest, and
                    most important to us, but he really neglected the Gulf. The rest of the Clinton
                    administration completely neglected the Gulf. Vice President Gore stopped off in
                    Oman for a refueling stop once, but other than that, senior Clinton
                    administration officials didn't pay much attention to the Arab world, except for
                    the Arab-Israeli conflict, and it was a disappointment. I think it started with
                    the President. I don't think the President really is interested in foreign
                    affairs very much and this is reflected in the rest of his administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues that you were dealing with
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: We dealt with intellectual property rights and working with them to pass a
                    law and then to implement the law. We dealt with visas. I went to the Minister
                    of Interior and said, “You only give an American businessmen a three month visa
                    and he has to have a sponsor. You don't require the British to have any visa.” I
                    knew this went back to the time when the British ran the place. The first time I
                    said this, the Minister said, “Frankly, we could give you a longer visa if it
                    doesn't apply to Arab-Americans.” I said, “Whoa, wait a minute. We can't do
                    that.” It was clear that they didn't trust Arab-Americans. So, that discussion
                    collapsed. Then a new Minister of Interior was appointed. I went to him and made
                    the same pitch and he was more open-minded. He said, “Okay” and we made a deal.
                    We agreed on a 10 year visa with no sponsor. UAE was the first Gulf state to do
                    that. Some of the other Gulf states have now done that. They realized that it
                    was hampering trade and business to have only a three month sponsored visa, so
                    we opened that up a bit.</p>
                <p>We didn't have any other major issues. We had quite a few sailors coming through
                    and no major incidents, fortunately and to my surprise. Somehow, they behaved
                    themselves. They were all told that if they misbehaved, they would forever lose
                    liberty, so they wanted to come and enjoy the beaches, the hotels, and the beer
                    in the hotels. These were the best ports in the Gulf. If you go to Saudi Arabia,
                    you can't drink. If you come to Abu Dhabi, you can drink in the hotels. We
                    discovered that the few sailors who got in trouble were the young sailors on
                    their first night ashore. They would go and get plastered and might get into
                    trouble somehow. They would steal a car and joyride around, that kind of

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is really the very young kids trying to show off and
                        show how tough they are. It's like fraternity initiations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>RUGH: Yes. We dealt with that. We set up a beer tent on the pier next to the
                    ship. The first night, they were allowed to go onto the pier, drink all they
                    wanted, but then they couldn't go into town. They had to go back on the ship.
                    That dealt with their initial splurge and spree. The second night, they were
                    allowed to go into town. That took care of that. So, there were very few
                    problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With intellectual property, I take it the problem was
                        copying videotapes, music, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Right. And textiles. What happened was that Pakistan and India were up
                    against their quota in textiles for export to the United States, so the
                    additional textiles that they wanted to ship to the United States they would
                    transship to the UAE. In the UAE, they would sew a label in a Pakistani shirt
                    saying “Made in the UAE” and then ship it off to the United States because the
                    UAE didn't meet the textile production quota. So, that was a violation of
                    intellectual property. We had to police that. But it was also videotapes and
                    audiotapes and even computer programs that were made in some apartment in Dubai
                    by Indians who were cranking these out and selling them very cheaply on the
                    market. And fake Rolexes and so on. So, we worked with the government and they
                    passed a law, but that was only the first stage. We had to get people to police
                    it. They were inexperienced in policing that kind of a law. I had many
                    discussions with the Commerce Minister and with others trying to persuade them
                    that it was in their interest to stop this piracy because there wasn't any gain
                    for the UAE and they were hurting their reputation and losing by this pirate
                    activity. They finally did enforce the law.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about banking? Banking came up before your time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>RUGH: The BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce and Industry) problem, yes, that
                    happened before I arrived. The BCCI was a Pakistani bank which Sheikh Zayid
                    bought into and then at the end when they were having difficulty, he bought a
                    controlling share. That was before the British revealed that there was a lot of
                    corruption in the bank and the whole bank collapsed. So, Sheikh Zayid was left
                    holding the bag and there were a lot of creditors who wanted to get paid back.
                    He put the Pakistanis who had started this whole scheme, this fraud, in jail in
                    Abu Dhabi, but there were still creditors out there demanding retribution. The
                    New York Attorney's Office was interested in investigation whether there was any
                    criminal activity involving American banks, so they were investigating it. The
                    U.S. Department of Justice was involved. I asked about this before I went out
                    because it was a big story just as I was going out. The State Department said,
                    “Try to stay out of it. Let Justice and the New York attorney deal with it. If
                    it comes across your screen, report, but don't get involved. It's a legal matter
                    and you don't want to muck up the case. Besides, it's New York. They're fairly
                    aggressive and they're not Washington.” So, I did try to stay out. I kept
                    informed and I informed Washington as much as I knew. At one point, even Jimmy
                    Carter came out. He had been involved with BCCI earlier. He asked me what was
                    going on. I told him what I knew. We saw the attorneys for both sides regularly.
                    They would come out and talk to us, but we sort of kept at arm's length at the
                    embassy. Finally, it was resolved by some of the Pakistanis who were in jail in
                    Abu Dhabi being transferred to American custody and tried in the United States.
                    That happened when I was there. It went smoothly. But it was an embarrassment
                    for Sheikh Zayid, who wasn't knowingly culpable. He didn't know that it was
                    fraudulent. But, of course, the New York attorney was not going to accept my
                    word on that. He was suspicious of everybody, including Sheikh Zayid, and wanted
                    to cross examine him and everything else. During most of this period, Sheikh
                    Zayid didn't come to the United States when he would have come here for a visit
                    and for medical treatment. His advisors thought he might get embarrassed by
                    somebody slapping a subpoena on him in the hospital or something. But then it
                    was cleared up and he did come. The whole matter was settled between the lawyers
                    on the UAE side and the lawyers in New York and in the Department of
                    Justice.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your original specialty, which is USIA? Were
                        you able to have much of a program going there? It's always difficult in an
                        Arab country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: The program there focused on the information side rather than the cultural
                    side. It was difficult, if not impossible, to do what USIA calls “cultural
                    presentations,” dance groups, singing groups, that kind of thing. It just didn't
                    have an audience in the UAE. But there was a lot of interest in American
                    education. The educational counselor at USIS/Abu Dhabi did a lot of educational
                    counseling. There was a lot of interest in American policy, so we dealt with the
                    press, all of the media. The journalists there were in close touch with the USIS
                    office. The newspapers had proliferated in the UAE. Nearly every emirate has its
                    own paper in English and Arabic. There are television stations all over the
                    country. So, there is a lot of media activity. That was the main focus, in
                    addition to the education work. Those were the two main avenues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did the young sons and daughters of the up and
                        coming classes go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: On the university level, the daughters tended to go to the UAE University
                    in country. Most of them went there. The sons tended to go abroad to the United
                    States primarily, but also to the UK and some to Germany and France. The
                    daughters stayed in the country for social reasons. Their families didn't like
                    them to go abroad. They were afraid of what terrible things might happen to them
                    if they came to American or even went to London. If they sent them abroad, they
                    usually sent them to Cairo, where they thought it was a bit safer. It's
                    culturally similar. But the sons went abroad. The university now has over 12,000
                    students. About 10,000 of those are women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the young men going to university in the United
                        States, were they more likely to go for technical education?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: Both. A lot of them went for undergraduate education. But they liked to
                    study engineering. A lot of them did undergraduate education there. Quite a few
                    of them had a very good education, very good English, very good training. There
                    are some Ph.D.s. They have over 100 university faculty with Ph.D.s and many of
                    those degrees are American. So, they've gotten the full range.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: I guess that pretty much covers it. It was a quiet period. My predecessor,
                    Ned Walker, had dealt with the Gulf War. He went off to the UN and then to Egypt
                    as ambassador and now he's going to Israel as ambassador. So, Ned had the Gulf
                    War to deal with. His predecessor had the Iran-Iraq War to deal with. I had
                    peace! So, it was a pleasant occasion.</p>
                <p>The UAE and Abu Dhabi in particular is a surprisingly civilized and pleasant
                    place to live. It's very quite and peaceful. Sheikh Zayid has done a lot in
                    planting millions of trees and building gardens. He is concerned about the
                    environment. It is, I think, the most pleasant place on the peninsula to live.
                    The quality of life is very good. People who go there don't want to leave. In
                    fact, I even know a Foreign Service officer who was assigned to Dubai and when
                    he was told to go to his next assignment, he quit the service and stayed in
                    Dubai. It is a nice living.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: In 1995, I returned to the United States and retired from the Foreign
                    Service.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUGH: There weren't any huge problems. The one that I mentioned earlier, the
                    implementation of a defense cooperation agreement, was a problem that nagged the
                    U.S. government and the embassy after I left for quite a while. But relations
                    were good. I felt comfortable leaving, that the relationship was in very good
                    shape.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the equivalent of Wahhabis or fundamentalists?
                        Was that a problem there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUGH: It really wasn't. We kept looking for it and didn't find it. UAE nationals
                    are religious. They are observant. They observe the fast. They pray. They go to
                    the mosque. They are believers. But they're not fanatic. Political Islam is not
                    attractive to them. I think it's partly prosperity, partly a lifestyle, and
                    partly Sheikh Zayid's example of tolerance and his approach to life, which is
                    very philosophic.</p>
