                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe you served in AID for thirty years? Starting
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please tell about your early life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Early years and education</p>
                <p>GILBERT: I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. My father was with the
                    International Harvester Company. He was exempt from the draft because of a stiff
                    leg due to a car accident. During World War II he was transferred to Birmingham,
                    Alabama. I lived in Alabama from the age of 2 until I was almost 11, except for
                    a year when we lived in the Chicago area due to my father's work. About half way
                    through our years in Alabama, my father and a partner bought an International
                    Harvester dealership in Bessemer, Alabama. The coal and iron industry strikes of
                    that period caused his business to drop off to the point that it would no longer
                    support two families. He and his partner sold that dealership, and we moved to
                    Austin, Minnesota where he and a new partner bought another dealership. That
                    business included a Packard agency that went on the rocks in 1954 when I was 15.
                    We returned to Minneapolis where he went back to work for the International
                    Harvester Company in their Minneapolis branch.</p>
                <p>In Minneapolis, as previously, I attended public schools. The high school I went
                    to was Washburn. It was quite good, and I think at least 60 per cent of its
                    graduates went on to college. I took science and math in high school. I
                    graduated in 1957, and, at that time, it was just assumed that any serious young
                    man with any brains at all would gravitate to engineering. In the Sputnik era,
                    that almost seemed like a patriotic duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What led to your career in USAID.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I started out in pre-engineering, and I just scraped through with “Cs.”
                    I was bored to tears. The lectures and reading affected me like knockout drops.
                    By a great stroke of luck, through family connections, I got a job with the
                    Minnesota Highway Department as a summer engineering intern following my
                    freshman year. I thought I might discover that I liked what engineers did more
                    than I liked what they studied. If so, it might be worth seeing through. Half
                    way through that summer I knew that I didn't care much for what engineers did
                    either. So I spent the rest of the summer pondering what I should do about
                    it.</p>
                <p>Since I was headed for mining engineering, I got to thinking about my reasons for
                    selecting that. I realized they were largely pecuniary. I also realized that I
                    would be unlikely to succeed in anything for which I felt no enthusiasm. This
                    led me to wonder what I would do if I was independently wealthy and could simply
                    follow my interests. It came to me that I had thought mining engineering, as
                    opposed to other engineering fields, would lead to overseas living experiences
                    and international work. I thought, “Wait a minute, dummy! If that's what you are
                    interested in, why not take the direct route and actually major in International
                    Relations?” I did and never slept in class or the library again. My grades shot
                    up into the range of respectability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you any exposure before that that would have pricked
                        your interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: My mother never went to college. This was due to economic reasons. My
                    grandmother, who was a career woman (a dietician trained at the Boston Cooking
                    School), had died when my mother was 18. My grandfather's earnings as a teacher
                    in small, residential Norwegian Lutheran secondary schools and colleges were
                    very low. My maternal grandparents didn't live together for roughly the last ten
                    years of my grandmother's life, reflecting something like divorce Norwegian
                    Lutheran-style. These circumstances and my grandmother's death about when my
                    mother graduated from high school made my mother the breadwinner to her two
                    younger siblings when she should have been in college. Nevertheless, she was one
                    of the more complete intellectuals I have ever known. She read voraciously in
                    French and English. A strikingly good-looking woman, she was also something of a
                    walking encyclopedia.</p>
                <p>We had a lot of books around the house, either our own or on loan from various
                    libraries. While still in grade school I was well on my way to reading
                    everything that Kipling ever wrote. One of the first adult books I read was Jan
                    Karski's The Secret State. Others were The Wall by John Hersey, Strange Lands
                    and Friendly People by William O. Douglas. Yet others included a book called
                    Coronet by a man named Komroff, one on exploring the Gobi Desert by Roy Chapman
                    Andrews. Many were Book of the Month Club selections. Most of the books that
                    stick in my memory were about foreign countries and other cultures.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Another factor was growing up in Minnesota where so many people, well represented
                    among members of the various elites, are “hyphenated” Americans and mindful, not
                    to say prideful, of their backgrounds. Minnesota is much more than
                    proportionately represented among Foreign Service people. This owes a lot to the
                    quality of the public schools and the numbers of trained people generated by the
                    state and private university-level institutions.</p>
                <p>Another huge factor was that my Norwegian-American grandfather lived with us
                    during much of my childhood. He had received a classical education at Decorah
                    Luther College, which was about the “only game in town” in his Norwegian
                    Lutheran milieu. He taught Latin and Greek and had studied Hebrew. He also spoke
                    Norwegian and German. He was a wonderful conversationalist and intellectual
                    mentor. It was as if I had my own Merlin (as depicted in The Once and Future
                    King). He never pushed any information or ideas on me. Instead his approach
                    could be likened to that of a skilled and patient fly fisherman. Whenever I bit
                    on a lure he would reel me in toward an understanding of the background, source
                    or foundation of some enticing remark or tidbit of information. Just to indicate
                    how strong the Norwegian milieu was, my mother - who, like her parents, was born
                    in Minnesota - learned her English in primary school. Yet my grandfather, and no
                    doubt my grandmother, spoke English perfectly.</p>
                <p>When I graduated with a major in International Relations from the University of
                    Minnesota, I got a tuition scholarship at the Fletcher School of Law and
                    Diplomacy at Tufts. When I graduated from there, I had a two-year Master's
                    Degree (MALD). After staying around long enough to take my Ph.D. generals, I
                    went to work for AID in January of 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular concentration while you were at
                        Tufts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: There, as at Minnesota, I concentrated in International Economics. But,
                    a big turning point occurred in the second semester of my first year at
                    Fletcher. I took a course in Development Economics taught by Charles
                    Kindleberger (of MIT) and Don Humphrey. And that set me off in a new direction.
                    It was such a quirky application of economics and so inescapably
                    interdisciplinary. It just fascinated me. Then, later on - during that second
                    year that I was at Fletcher, I guess - I was amazed to learn that, wonder of
                    wonders, there was actually an agency of the U.S. government concerned with
                    applying the things I had been studying. Up to then I had seen myself as headed
                    for a career in the State Department (i.e. diplomatic) Foreign Service. From
                    then on my sights shifted to a career in AID.</p>
                <p>But we had to have both functional and area concentrations. Though my functional
                    concentration was in international and development economics, my area
                    concentration became Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>GILBERT: And I fully expected that I would go to work for AID and focus my career
                    on Southern Asia, probably not the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you hear about AID and the Foreign Assistance
                        Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I'm not sure I can reconstruct it exactly. But I am pretty sure I
                    learned a lot about AID from Brad Langmaid who was a member of my class at
                    Fletcher. He had actually worked for AID between our first and second years on
                    some kind of internship.</p>
                <p>Joined USAID and first assignments - 1964</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, how did you get into AID? What was the
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I took the Management Intern Exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Junior Management Intern Exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. Not surprisingly, we tended to forget or omit the “junior” part,
                    but I came in as a Junior Management Intern. My first rotation was in the Policy
                    and Planning Coordination (PPC) Bureau. I was located in an Office directed by
                    Clarence Gulick and his deputy, David Cole. My two-month rotation in that office
                    was a wonderful introduction to AID for someone with my background and
                    interests. This was during the time of AID's first Administrator. He had
                    established an advisory panel on international development, which met
                    monthly.Clarence's office was the secretariat for that advisory panel. The
                    membership of this panel consisted of people like Rosenstein-Rodan, Dean Edward
                    Mason of Harvard, a man named Johnson from Columbia Teacher's College who led
                    one of the major sector studies that were launched in the early days of the
                    Nigeria program, etc. As I recall, one of the speakers was Walt Rostow. Others
                    were Ted Schulz (the University of Chicago's famous agricultural economist) and
                    Glenn Johnson (head of the Food Policy Center at Stanford). Given that a meeting
                    was held on the first or second day of my rotation, I was able to attend three
                    meetings of this panel during my two months in PPC. I had the job of writing up
                    the proceedings of the second meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. The AID Administrator was David Bell?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, and it was David E. Bell who chaired most of these meetings. One of
                    those who made presentations was Rosenstein-Rodan. Anyway, it was a panel of the
                    great and the good. Oh, Dean Mason was actually the chair of the group. But
                    David Bell often sat in. And Hollis Chenery was head of PCC then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was a dazzling introduction to AID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything in particular about the issues or
                        topics they discussed or viewpoints or anything of that sort, or about
                        conclusions that they were drawing about AID's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No. I don't. But I'll tell you, having started off that way and having
                    actually studied economic development in graduate school, permanently inoculated
                    me against being overly enthusiastic about the sort of intellectual “fads” that
                    periodically swept over AID and the development community, including the World
                    Bank, during the years that followed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, those discussions, the reading I did in graduate school and the
                    stimuli I received in those early days gave me an unshakable sense that there
                    just aren't any magic bullets. It was strongly instilled in me that every
                    country is unique, even though third world countries tend to share common
                    characteristics, and that a balanced approach has to be taken to development.
                    And, if one donor doesn't support a balanced approach, then the donors as a
                    group need to do so. The host government authorities themselves definitely have
                    to follow a balanced approach to get where they need to go. And it has too often
                    been clear to me that we risked losing sight of the need for balance in practice
                    even if we never abandoned it in principle. The worst thing was that the donors
                    tend to embrace the same fads at more or less the same time, so the collectivity
                    of donors also neglected the need to encourage and support balanced
                    strategies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any impressions or a feel for what AID was
                        about or what is was supposed to be or what its development strategy was at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I always thought AID was in the development business, and, that,
                    no matter what we said to Congress about fighting the cold war, development was
                    our real mandate and mission. And I was always very unhappy and dissatisfied and
                    chafed at the way I thought AID pandered to a different view of its mission by
                    justifying a lot of its activities and programs in Cold War terms, vis-�-vis
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of political and security interests...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we will come back to that point later. So you were
                        there in PPC only two months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That's right. So then, after PPC, I went next to the Turkey desk. And
                    the big issue then was the Keban Dam. There were two dams that were being
                    considered. The other was Ciceroz. As part of the preparations for a donor
                    meeting that was scheduled to occur within the next few months, I was asked to
                    write a paper on the Keban Dam and whether it seemed to make sense. As I recall,
                    I mainly tried to determine whether the demand projections for electric power
                    were realistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you conclude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe I concluded that the demand projections were reasonable. Now,
                    thinking back on it, I don't think anybody - and certainly I was no exception -
                    was worried about its social or environmental impact. And I'm sure I got so
                    wrapped up in various approaches to the dealing with the demand issue, that I
                    totally neglected the other issues concerning trade-offs and opportunity costs
                    that the project posed. But, my main task was to address the demand issue. There
                    were two huge studies on the Keban and Ciceroz dams and my task was not to
                    critique them in their entirety.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The project went ahead, I guess. Was it an AID
                        project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe it did, and I believe AID participated in the financing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was AID funded or multi-donor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Multi-donor funded.</p>

                <p>Completed internship with assignment to the Nigeria Desk - 1964-1966</p>
                <p>And then, knowing my third rotational assignment as a junior management intern
                    probably ought to be one where there was a good prospect for a permanent job, I
                    cast about and found that the most interesting opportunity at the time was on
                    the Nigeria Desk. And so I became one of three or four people on the Nigeria
                    desk working under Ralph Fisher.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: This was in about April or May of 1964. And it was a very exciting time
                    to be associated with the Nigeria program. It was as if the whole range of the
                    PPC advisory council deliberations concerning global development were being
                    focused on the Nigeria case. At that time in-depth studies were being or had
                    been done on Nigeria's key development sectors. John F. Kennedy had made a
                    pledge of what seemed at the time an enormous amount of funding. And I wish that
                    I could recall for sure the amount.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: $225 million.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It seemed like an astronomical sum at the time. And I guess it was,
                    considering price levels at that time. And a series of sectoral studies had been
                    put in motion. From these studies multi-year sectoral strategies would be
                    developed. They would serve as the basis for programming the $225 million. As I
                    recall the Nigerians were already “the Nigerians,” and they were quite impatient
                    with that approach. Many of them thought we should just hand them the $225
                    million. Notwithstanding this concept, there was already an extensive portfolio
                    of projects that had been started either before the studies or on the assumption
                    that many priorities were beyond doubt.</p>
                <p>When I came on the desk, the Africa Bureau and the mission were beginning to sift
                    through these studies. Some were in progress and some were coming out in draft.
                    To use an analogy from British public administration practice, it was as though
                    we - having received the “committee reports” - needed to work through them and
                    frame AID “white papers” for each sector.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular study that stood out in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No. I mostly remember the ferment. And then I wound up staying on the
                    Nigeria desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For how long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Until September or October of 1966. I remember going out to Nigeria for
                    about six weeks in March or April of 1966. I spent part of that time traveling
                    to the Western, Midwestern, Eastern and Northern Regions (including all the
                    principal cities and universities) to project sites and spending another part of
                    that time in the Lagos office where they were developing a strategy document. I
                    was charged with writing pieces on the investment promotion and enterprise
                    development areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was after the first coup, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. And I'm having a little trouble reconstructing how that worked
                    because I can't imagine there wasn't a mission strategy in place prior to that.
                    Maybe this was a re-fiddling of the strategy that was necessary because of that
                    coup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you worked on private investment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: And small enterprise development; these things tended to go together.
                    They were in one office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything particular about the
                        strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I remember that when I was working on the desk, investment
                    promotion and indigenous enterprise development were part of my “portfolio.”
                    Peter Kolar handled agriculture and public administration and somebody else
                    handled education. I remember the Arthur D. Little (ADL) contract for an
                    investment promotion project and an indigenous enterprise development project
                    implemented by AID direct-hire staff that operated in Eastern Nigeria. A man
                    named Virgil Poling conceived the project. A young guy named Peter Kirby was
                    associated with it in the planning phase and went on to publish quite a bit on
                    subjects related to small enterprise development. Eddie Rothblum was the head of
                    the USAID Nigeria office that managed these activities.</p>
                <p>And I guess I really thought that was the answer to the maiden's prayer in those
                    days. And I continue to think that a lot of that was useful. Of course, in those
                    days we were not concerned about the policy framework the way we would be
                    now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Though we still had economists in those days, one didn't hear much
                    discussion about economic policy. AID's main preoccupation in those days was
                    with saving and investment rates. And we certainly didn't expect there to be
                    very much spontaneous private investment or private savings in a country like
                    Nigeria at that time. Though we were preoccupied with the need to raise the
                    savings and investment rates, we thought of that problem in terms of programs
                    and training rather than incentives to investors and rewards to savers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about your work in Nigeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I guess I remember how terrible I thought our programming methods were
                    in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what respect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, things weren't really “projectized,” they were sort of
                    “theme-ized.” You know, there was an investment promotion project and there was
                    the indigenous industries project. And yes, these were projects, but there was
                    very little definition of what they consisted of and how much money they should
                    have over what period of time. There were loose ideas about these things, but
                    there was very little systematic documentation of these parameters and nobody
                    felt particularly committed to abide by them. So every year there would be a
                    scramble to see how much money you could have for this, that and the other
                    thing. As I recall, it was a very fluid and very frustrating process. And it
                    depended a lot upon personalities, influence and pressures. There was precious
                    little in the way of rules or standards that had to be observed in processing
                    and justifying changes in project parameters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Then, you left in 1966.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>First overseas assignment to the USAID Mission in Ghana - 1966-1971</p>
                <p>GILBERT: I went to Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your assignment there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I was the Assistant Program Officer to begin with. And I also ran a
                    training operation. We didn't have a Training Officer. Gordon Evans was the
                    Program Officer. Frank Pinder was the Mission Director. I don't think there was
                    a Deputy. I never worked so hard in my life as during those four years. It was
                    especially tough at the beginning. I was spending just about every waking moment
                    in the office and trying to convince people that we needed a Training
                    Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What characterized the training program. What were you
                        trying to do, what was the point of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: You know, I don't clearly remember. There was project-related training
                    for most projects. There was also some training that was funded out of special
                    accounts or regional projects such as AFGRAD and ASPAU. I'm not sure I
                    accurately remember what those initials stand for, but the former was for
                    post-graduate and the latter for undergraduate education. AFGRAD was very
                    competitive and ASPAU probably was also. Over the years I met and often worked
                    with a lot of the people who returned from AFGRAD training. In my experience all
                    of them were extremely capable and well trained. Any many made really important
                    contributions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In large numbers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The numbers weren't large - probably fewer than ten new starts per year
                    for a country like Ghana. But they were significant and the associated workload
                    wasn't particularly visible. A fair amount of processing and related liaison was
                    required for each participant in order to make sure they got passport pictures
                    taken, got certification as participant trainees so that the right visas could
                    be issued, got in to see the consular officer, etc.</p>
                <p>Then, thank heavens, one day Frank Pinder, a lovely man and quite a tough one,
                    went in to my office after hours and did something of desk audit on me. And he
                    concluded that I should have a Training Officer. After that my life improved
                    quite a bit.</p>
                <p>We didn't have a U.S. direct-hire economist, but we had an FSN economist whom I
                    supervised. One of his chief duties was to prepare a report every year on
                    Government of Ghana public finances. Getting him to produce product that we
                    could present with a straight face for clearance by the Embassy Economics
                    Officer was a nightmare. It was only in about 1968 that my life was further
                    improved by the assignment of a Program Economist.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>One of my first Ghana memories was that Gordon Evans handed me an airgram about
                    the idea of a smallpox-measles program. He said, in effect, “I don't know what
                    this is, but figure out what to do with it.” When I finally found time to flip
                    through it, my reaction was that it was an unrealistic, lobby-driven initiative
                    from left field. It certainly hadn't followed a normal path through the AID
                    programming process (not that there was much definition of that). CDC (then that
                    stood for Communicable Diseases Center) and WHO were the instigators, and there
                    had surely been some communications from either Washington or Atlanta with the
                    Ghanaians because one day a wonderful man named Dr. Frank Grant (a Ghanaian)
                    from the Ministry of Health came by and wanted to talk about smallpox and
                    measles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first African epidemiologist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I don't recall his specialty but that makes sense. He also had a message
                    and said, “Maybe we should talk about this.” That was a pain in the neck - it
                    meant that I REALLY had to read the damn thing. It was clear that this wasn't
                    something that would go away if we scoffed. It was coming at us a hundred miles
                    an hour, and we really had to get moving even though we already had too much on
                    our plates. And nobody else on either his side or mine could focus on the
                    matter. So the two of us sat down and “whomped up” an agreement for an activity
                    financed by AID, sponsored by WHO and implemented by CDC - thus fitting no model
                    or guidance available in the Manual Orders - and got it signed with precious
                    little fanfare - or, at least, none that I recall. And that exercise turned out
                    ultimately to be a good, even fun, experience since Frank Grant was such a good
                    guy.</p>
                <p>And then, lo and behold, all kinds of crazy things started happening. People
                    started arriving. Soon CDC people were working out of a local office in close
                    collaboration with the Health Ministry to implement the program. And that turned
                    out to be one of the most successful things we've ever done.</p>
                <p>Now that I think back, I remember being sent in the summer of 1966 to CDC in
                    Atlanta to brief a group of field officers who were to be stationed in Africa.
                    These people turned out, in most cases, to be the staff of the Smallpox-Measles
                    Program. Yet the Smallpox-Measles Program, per se, was a surprise. I wonder now
                    what I was told their exact functions were to be. I think I had the impression
                    that their main function would be liaison and epidemiological cooperation with
                    national authorities and regional bodies.</p>
                <p>And that illustrates why being an Assistant Program Officer was always
                    interesting; if you had enough energy and stamina, you were the de facto head of
                    a one-person “Office of Miscellaneous Affairs.” And everything that other people
                    didn't quite know what to do with, or didn't want to deal with, found its way to
                    your desk. And, as with the embryonic Smallpox-Measles Program, one often had a
                    frightening degree of latitude because no one else could focus on such
                    matters.</p>

                <p>I guess the next such thing that came along was population and family
                    planning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that get started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I'm not quite sure of the chronology, but I do remember that sometime
                    during the summer or spring of 1967 I had to go to a population conference in
                    Monrovia. That was just when Jane and our first and second sons went back to the
                    States so that Jane could give birth to our third son. (I remember sending a
                    couple of toys to them courtesy of someone in Monrovia who was to board their
                    Pan Am flight when it transited Roberts Field.) Ray Ravenholt and Philander
                    Claxton were there. Ravenholt was AID's head of population and family planning.
                    I think that Claxton was responsible for that subject in the State Department. I
                    think that we had been getting messages on this. One of them called for an
                    assessment of the population and family planning situation in Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any programs in that area in Ghana at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Certainly there were not government programs. The Ghana Planned
                    Parenthood Association (GPPA) existed and had, I believe, been getting some
                    pretty modest financing from international bodies such as the International
                    Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and/or U.S. groups such as the Margaret
                    Sanger Foundation. The GPPA was a private operation whose membership was mainly
                    confined to a very few, somewhat “garden society-type” Ghanaians. As I remember
                    it, the Ministry of Health and/or the Medical School of the University of Ghana,
                    from whose staff its leadership was drawn, permitted the GPPA to use certain
                    clinics after official hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember sending anybody on a training program on
                        population matters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I think I recall that some of the doctors and nurses in GPPA had
                    traveled to the U.S. under Margaret Sanger sponsorship for training on loop
                    insertion, etc. I think that I had to facilitate the arrangements.</p>
                <p>Let me rummage through my memories and see what else turns up. We were asked to
                    do some kind of an assessment, and I think it was before I went to the Monrovia
                    conference. Dr. Julius (Bud) Prince had come out to have a look at possible
                    areas. He and I contacted a lot of people who were involved in family planning
                    and the GPPA.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I remember that it involved people at the Medical School. The most important of
                    these was Fred Sai, the Professor of Preventive and Social Medicine. Dr.
                    Bentsi-Enchill, the Professor of Obstetrics, was another. And it involved people
                    in the Department of Sociology, especially the Demographic Unit, at the
                    University of Ghana.</p>
                <p>And out of those discussions came some ideas. One of these led to the Danfa
                    Project. Another concerned a demographic sample survey that Sammy K. Gaisie
                    wanted to do. As I recall, Sammy had something quite modest in mind that Bud
                    pounced on it and encouraged him to expand it to a scale that would produce
                    findings relevant to national planning and policy development. And so began a
                    dialogue on the demographic survey. Bud arranged for a guy named Abner Hurwitz
                    (from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to come out to work with Sammy. Ab
                    was a sampling expert and helped Sammy with that aspect of the survey design. In
                    those days, it would have been normal for AID to assign a U.S. advisor to watch
                    over and support something as sophisticated as this was shaping up to be. Ab,
                    who saw clearly what an exceptionally mature and disciplined scholar Sammy
                    Gaisie was, said this was not necessary. He said that it would be sufficient
                    that he visit Ghana for a few weeks every 90 days or so to check on progress and
                    provide any corrective input that might be needed. This was viewed in some
                    quarters as bordering on irresponsible, and I recall its being repeatedly
                    questioned. The Demographic Survey was a complete success. It made Sammy
                    Gaisie's reputation, and he went on to have an international career like many
                    well-educated Ghanaians of his generation. He was extremely grateful for being
                    given that opportunity and wrote a very touching tribute to Abner Hurwitz in the
                    preface to the Ph.D. thesis that emerged from that research.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a general demographic survey, or a survey of
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was a national demographic survey that illuminated the dynamics of
                    the population in a way that wasn't possible based on any complete census. And
                    there was a terrific amount of resistance to it in some quarters.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>It was a real revelation to me to watch what happened as we tried to develop this
                    idea. We saw a degree of professional jealousy and rivalry that I would not have
                    credited had I not seen it myself. I soon came to realize that this was largely
                    a function of the penury that pervaded the Ghana public service then. It was
                    also due to a tendency — perhaps, culturally derived — of the concerned parties
                    to see the world as a zero-sum game. Sammy needed access to not-yet-published
                    census data in order to design his sampling framework. The responsible
                    professional at the Central Bureau of Statistics didn't have the staff or the
                    funds for some things that he wanted to do with this data. At the very least, he
                    thought that all chance of his plans going forward would be lost if Sammy got at
                    it. Most probably, as a Ph.D. demographer himself (and a well qualified one, at
                    that, who had gained a good reputation for his administration of the Census
                    Unit), he may also have feared that Sammy's reputation would eclipse his own.
                    From the fuss and the resistance one might have supposed the stakes were life
                    and death. I'm not sure what we did to gain the cooperation Sammy needed from
                    the Central Bureau of Statistics, but it probably involved a certain amount of
                    “bribery” in the form of staff training and commodity support. Anyway Sammy got
                    what he needed and the survey went forward.</p>
                <p>I saw this “zero-sum game” behavior often during my later career. I never had
                    time to analyze whether it was rational or irrational behavior on the part of
                    the antagonists. It is a chilling thought, but I think one can probably
                    demonstrate that it is rational at the level of real politik.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the government supported going ahead with the
                        Demographic Survey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, one could say that there was a green light and some collaboration
                    from government agencies, notably the Ministry of Education. Primary and middle
                    school (but not secondary school) teachers were used as enumerators. Why not
                    secondary teachers? One of the fascinating things I learned about sample surveys
                    was that one needs enumerators who are literate and conscientious, but not too
                    intelligent or sophisticated. If you get people who are too intelligent, it is
                    almost inevitable that difficulties will result. Among the “sophisticates” there
                    are bound to be some who will interpret and improve (”spin”) respondents'
                    answers or even resort to outright falsification of questionnaires in lieu of
                    actually conducting the interviews. Human nature is the same among the
                    non-sophisticates, but their misdeeds are easier to detect.</p>
                <p>So the demographic sample survey went forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that resulted in one of the first demographic sample
                        surveys?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe it was the first; failing that, it was certainly the most
                    ambitious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was countrywide?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Countrywide. It was countrywide in that there were, say, 12 sample areas
                    and they were in the key demographic and cultural zones in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a census.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was a sample survey that couldn't have been done had a complete
                    census not been done earlier. The census was needed to provide a framework for
                    drawing the sample.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was focused on what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: On population dynamics: i.e., death rates, birth rates, family size, age
                    structure of the population and also some KAP (knowledge, attitudes and
                    practices) content such as desired family size, knowledge of and attitudes
                    toward contraception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was family planning related?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. One of the surprising things was that most younger women's desired
                    family size was something like eight kids. And some women wanted to space their
                    births a little but they sure as heck didn't want small families. Anyway
                    planning also began on the Danfa Project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the Danfa Project as you saw it at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It focused on districts or subdistricts a bit north of Legon, not too
                    far from the University of Ghana. And the idea was to introduce different mixes
                    of health education, primary care and family planning services into three
                    treatment areas. There was a fourth untreated area that served as a control. A
                    great deal of health and demographic data was collected for analysis. The aim
                    was to reach conclusions based on comparisons of family planning acceptance
                    rates, fertility rates and health status indicators as to which combination of
                    treatments was the most cost-effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In terms of providing family-planning services, is that
                        what you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, the design that AID bought into emphasized the goal of identifying
                    the most cost-effective method of encouraging and supporting family planning
                    among rural populations. For example, of the three treatment areas, I think one
                    received only family planning education in the context of health education, a
                    second got that plus primary health care while a third was showered with primary
                    care, health/family planning education and family planning services. As I
                    recall, no area received family planning services alone since that was simply
                    “unacceptable.” So the concept was centered on family planning but only in a
                    broader health services and health education context. But as the design and
                    implementation processes unfolded, the agenda became more and more elaborate.
                    This was one of the first projects that I can remember where a university was
                    given the go-ahead, subject to certain budgetary and conceptual constraints, to
                    design a project that it would also implement. It may have been at the beginning
                    of Title XII. Al Newman was the overall leader of this process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OUCLA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, the School of Public Health. An obstetrician Jerry Niswanger led a
                    small project design team. The first Chief of Party during the implementation
                    phase was Dr. Irv Lourie. And as things went along, the project turned out to be
                    much more statistically and operationally elaborate than envisioned. I left
                    while the project was still quite young, but I definitely had the feeling that
                    the project agenda grew “like Topsy”. I wouldn't say that we were betrayed or
                    snookered, but I would say it is a classic example of two phenomena. One is that
                    things always turn out to be more complicated than one thinks as the outset. The
                    more the experts got into the design and implementation of the project, the more
                    things they found to look into or to guard against. The other phenomenon is that
                    coalition building is essential to moving a program like Danfa forward.
                    Coalitions form around agendas. It is very rare that an agenda can remain stable
                    or pure as a coalition expands. The Ghanaians' original concept of Danfa was
                    extremely modest, but couldn't remain so. And, the world is probably better
                    because it didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fred Sai was the head of the medical school, I guess, at
                        that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: He was the Professor of Preventive and Social Medicine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is right. What was his idea originally? He was the
                        one who originally started the Danfa Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Fred and his people conceived the project, and it was under his
                    department. When we first talked to him he had something much simpler in mind,
                    and I believe it was operating in a very embryonic form. As I recall, they were
                    mainly focused on primary care and health education. They used the center as a
                    practical training site. They may have been thinking of also developing a model
                    rural health structure. But he didn't have funding and AID did. And we wanted to
                    promote family planning. So I think Bud Prince drew him toward emphasizing the
                    family planning aspect, which was pretty secondary if not tertiary until then.
                    So the agenda shifted toward family planning when the Department of Preventive
                    and Social Medicine entered into a coalition with the AID Africa Bureau. When
                    UCLA joined the coalition the agenda shifted heavily toward research and from a
                    narrow to a broader research focus.</p>
                <p>And about when the Danfa Project was getting launched the Ford Foundation
                    assigned Gordon Perkin to be resident Family Planning Advisor in Accra. The Ford
                    Foundation had previously sent a number of people out to do some very good
                    studies. One of these involved preparation by a Ford expert of a draft
                    Government Population Policy. Gordon arrived about when agreement had been
                    reached on the policy document. His job was to work with the planning group in
                    the Ministry of Economy and Plan (or words to that effect) on how it should be
                    implemented. Gordon and I began to meet frequently, including for lunch at the
                    Maharajah Restaurant every Friday, to share information and ideas. We were
                    natural allies, and neither of us had much of anyone else to talk to about
                    population and family planning. A key issue at this time was how a government
                    population and family planning program should be structured and who should be
                    responsible for it. This, and the question of how we could encourage and support
                    its development, preoccupied us for months and months.</p>
                <p>On the Ghanaian side, Fred Sai, when he was Head of Preventive and Social
                    Medicine at the University, was a pioneering supporter of family planning and
                    one of Gordon's key interlocutors and collaborators. And out of our discussions
                    came a shared concept of what we were working toward as well as a division of
                    labor between AID and the Ford Foundation. Our vision was that Ford would take
                    the lead in making punctual or targeted inputs of technical assistance that were
                    so important to helping the Ghanaians clarify and elaborate their plans and
                    programs. The Ford Foundation had only modest amounts of money, but they had a
                    diversified stable of highly competent specialists in all areas of population
                    and family planning and were nimble in a way that AID could never hope to match.
                    On the other hand, AID potentially had significant resources available to
                    provide sustained and substantial support to the implementation of Ghanaian
                    programs once formulated. And I was writing up a longer-term program of support
                    for the central government level population and family planning program that
                    seemed to be emerging from the dialogue between Gordon and his colleagues with
                    the Ministry of Economy and Plan on behalf of the Government. That ministry had
                    been taking the lead on population matters. The Ministry of Health's leadership
                    at that time had little or no interest in family planning.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Fred Sai wasn't in the Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes and no. He moved over to become Chief Medical Officer in the
                    Ministry of Health (equivalent to Principal Secretary) while all this was in
                    process.</p>
                <p>He was still at the University while Gordon and I were doing most of our planning
                    and design work. Gordon was working primarily with people in the Ministry of
                    Economics and Plan - mainly with the planning and analytical staff, but also
                    getting input from time to time from the overall Principal Secretary, B.K.
                    Mensah. I believe the Principal Secretary for Donor Coordination, Harry Nelson,
                    was also tracking these things as was the Commissioner, E.N. Omaboe. Their
                    Ministry, and Omaboe in particular, had taken the first initiative in seeking
                    help on population matters from the Ford Foundation and others because they
                    could see that Ghana's development prospects were threatened by its population
                    trends.</p>
                <p>So, out of our work came an AID project proposal that involved a certain amount
                    of technical advisory, training and financial support for a National Family
                    Planning Program. It was to be conducted on an inter-ministerial basis under the
                    coordination of a family planning secretariat located in the Ministry of Economy
                    and Plan. This latter feature had been advocated by Fred Sai who said that the
                    program should not under any circumstances be in the Ministry of Health because
                    it would always be treated like a branch of the national pharmaceutical system
                    in charge of a dangerous drug - something to be managed very cautiously, not to
                    say timidly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: So, just about the time the ink was dry on the proposals that went into
                    Washington on this, Fred Sai was named Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of
                    Health. And that is where I learned in practical terms that “Where you sit is
                    where you stand.” And from that time on, Fred Sai began to lobby against the
                    National Family Planning Program idea. He and Al Newman began to advocate the
                    Danfa Project as a model for bringing family planning to everybodnot just the
                    rural population - through the Ministry of Health. And overnight the idea of an
                    inter-ministerial National Family Planning Program with a secretariat in the
                    Ministry of Economy and Plan became anathema to Fred. For our part, Gordon and I
                    would never have disputed that the Danfa Project could contribute importantly to
                    effective to the development of a rural health structure to reach the average
                    Ghanaian with health, including family planning, services. But, meanwhile, there
                    was a great need for straight family planning information and services among
                    urban and modern sector people. The Ministry of Health, we knew, would take
                    forever to notice, let alone respond to, to this need. We could see no reason
                    for the provision of family planning information and services to this population
                    to be restricted to Ministry of Health channels.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So, just about when the project proposal that represented Gordon's and my
                    thinking landed in Washington, this turn-around happened. And there was
                    obviously some back (or maybe “front” from their point of view!) channel
                    communications among the health folks in the Ghana Government and AID/Washington
                    to which I was not privy. Fred Sai and Al Newman made a few trips back and forth
                    between the U.S. and Ghana during this time. I began to realize from the kind of
                    questions that were raised and the way my answers weren't listened to that Al
                    and Fred were busy lobbying in the African Bureau against the project proposal
                    that I had prepared and the Mission had submitted. And so nothing was done for
                    over a year. I don't think AID assistance really came on stream for the National
                    Family Planning Program in Ghana until shortly after I was transferred to
                    Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any national policy on family planning and
                        population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: A policy document was developed with help from the Ford Foundation, and
                    I'm pretty sure that it was promulgated after inevitable delays. The National
                    Family Planning Secretariat was set up, and a guy named Dr. A.A. Armah became
                    the first head of it. And there was an inauguration of this sometime during late
                    1970. It was held at State House. The police band played, and it was quite an
                    elegant affair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came in the fall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: You were there, I think, by then. Looking around at that inauguration
                    observance, I couldn't help but reflect on what large changes had occurred in
                    the status and profile of family planning during my time there. When I first
                    arrived in Ghana people literally spoke about family planning in hushed tones
                    and as though it were an indecent topic. But U.S. support didn't come on stream
                    when it was needed. And so the secretariat just kind of dangled and spun its
                    wheels. And, frankly, I think it was one of the worst AID foul ups that I ever
                    witnessed.</p>
                <p>We are all products of our experience, and this was a bitter experience for me.
                    This is where I began to be highly skeptical of AID's and, especially, of AID
                    Washington's ability to be serious about development or follow-through on its
                    own policies, not to mention the various “emphases” that it promulgated with
                    such tiresome regularity. The damage to the National Family Planning Program was
                    irretrievable because the push that would have imparted needed momentum never
                    came. And the people in the Secretariat had enemies. And one of the most
                    implacable was the new Chief Medical Officer who regarded Dr. Armah, the head of
                    the Secretariat, as an ungrateful former prot�g� and upstart.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>And once the Secretariat was born weak, all those whose cooperation was needed
                    thought its functions, and the resource allocations that potentially would go
                    with them, were up for grabs. So we saw the old zero-sum game mentality come
                    into full play. And Dr. Armah didn't cover himself with glory. He was not an
                    attractive figure, and he showed no flair or creativity in dealing with the
                    challenges he faced. But, in fairness, we'll never know whether anyone could
                    have played the poor hand he was dealt much better. His approach was to circle
                    the wagons and go off the deep end in asserting his de jure role as
                    inter-ministerial coordinator. The Secretariat was actively opposed and thwarted
                    at every turn by the Ministry of Health and other interests. As far as I could
                    determine after I left Ghana, the National Family Planning Program had a pretty
                    troubled life. It is easy to criticize Armah, but I'm not sure that anyone could
                    have done much better. And sometimes there is a basis for the paranoia that can
                    push someone who is “susceptible” over the edge into a disproportionate
                    response. I thought it was a little like Nkrumah going off the deep end after
                    independence. When he promulgated the Preventive Detention Act, it was in
                    response to plots that really could have toppled his Government. And that made
                    the plotters all the more determined and Nkrumah all the more dictatorial.</p>
                <p>The bitterness I felt at witnessing this mess in the population sphere was
                    compounded by the fact that it coincided with mismanagement of economic policy.
                    And I had been so hopeful about Ghana's prospects...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pause for a minute and go back a minute and talk a
                        little about what was the situation in Ghana at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it was the first time I had ever seen a scarcity economy. You
                    could hardly ever find anything but the bare staples - the minimum necessities
                    of life - in the stores. I remember two things vividly. One is that we had a
                    big, dry lawn. Nobody had lived in the house we were assigned to for maybe six
                    months before our arrival. It took me several weeks to buy and splice together
                    enough sections of hose to make a hose that was long enough to water our lawn
                    and garden.</p>
                <p>It took me a very long time to assure myself of a supply of beer. You could buy
                    beer but you had to turn in empties each time because there was a serious
                    shortage of beer bottles. Another guy and I discovered that if you bought beer
                    by the case they would accept your turning in a case of empties lacking two
                    bottles (you paid for the missing ones). But if you lacked three, it was no
                    dice. So we began a process that I referred to as “breeding” beer bottles. For a
                    long time we would hold back two empties from each case handed in until a
                    newcomer — beginning with me — could get his very own, very precious case of
                    empties. And this is how I was finally able get back to buying beer without the
                    help from my friends — a threshold I thought I had crossed for good on reaching
                    my 21st birthday.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Before joining AID I had received a pretty extensive training in economics,
                    including economic history and comparative economics. (In retrospect, my
                    education in this area continued throughout my time in Ghana.) And I really came
                    to Ghana believing that a liberal socialist model for running an economy could
                    be made to work. It was obvious that the economy was in terrible shape, but I
                    wasn't ready to conclude that the whole thing had been doomed from its
                    conception as opposed to simply having been screwed up by people who were either
                    incompetent or wrongly motivated. However, my view on this changed during my
                    years in Ghana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: In January 1996 there had been a coup against President-for-Life Kwame
                    Nkrumah. This brought a junta of army and police officers to power. They
                    announced that they would hand the country back to civilian rule in three years
                    and launched a program of economic stabilization and reform. They placed
                    economic policy in the hands of E.N. Omaboe, previously the Chief Government
                    Statistician. After rather rushed consultations with the International Monetary
                    Fund (IMF), Omaboe came up with what seemed at the time like a very good
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Economic program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, an economic stabilization program. And they quickly got support
                    from the IMF and the World Bank as well as the U.S. government and other donors.
                    And this support remained strong throughout most of my time at Ghana. It began
                    to wear thin during my last months therlate 1970 to early 1971.</p>
                <p>And I would have to say that it was a very good show in many ways. They launched
                    an “essential imports program” that reduced total imports significantly. And
                    they carried out a public sector retrenchment exercise coupled with a
                    labor-intensive public works - mainly feeder roads - rehabilitation program. I
                    believe they called this a public sector labor redeployment scheme. And to help
                    in controlling inflation, they had one currency reform and at least one
                    devaluation.</p>
                <p>And then they began to “spin off” state enterprises. AID's assistance portfolio
                    included a Commodity Import Program, which actually provided foreign exchange
                    through the banking system to importers who could plausibly buy their
                    intermediate goods or raw materials from U.S. suppliers. All of this was carried
                    out within the framework of import licensing and foreign exchange controls as
                    well as price controls and subsidized bank interest rates that remained little
                    changed from Nkrumah's day. But very little was said about that in the first 18
                    months after the coup. And I really believe all of us - except a few hopeless
                    cynics - really had a sense of excitement and high purpose. We believed we were
                    participating in a turning point in Ghanaian history.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>But it didn't turn out that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were also moving toward elections at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well that is right, and their timing was a key factor in determining the
                    outcome of the economic program. The NLC had pledged an early return to civilian
                    rule, and it gradually came to be understood that this should happen after they
                    had been in power about three years - i.e., in 1969. They had planned elections
                    in 1968, I think. Or was it 1969?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1969.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, 1969. There had been a coup attempt in 1967 that was interpreted by
                    some as an attempt to exploit impatience with the austerity of the NLC's
                    stabilization program. As the time for the elections drew nearer, the NLC seemed
                    less intent on straightening out the economy and more committed to ensuring that
                    the 1969 elections wouldn't produce a return of Nkrumah's people and policies.
                    Although the economy had improved during the NLC period, it only progressed from
                    horrible to very bad. For example, the government never did manage to restore
                    the economy to normal functioning. This was because they had to force imports
                    down to a volume that permitted neither the importation nor the local production
                    of a normal range and volume of consumer goods. And this was a matter of forcing
                    balance by restrictive import licensing and foreign exchange controls. These
                    allocations had relatively little to do with economic efficiency. To the extent
                    they sustained economic activity rather than consumption, they mainly supported
                    the largely inefficient state-owned import-competing manufacturing sector.
                    Because production and income increased only slightly and the Government raised
                    public sector wages in 1967, government revenues remained insufficient to cover
                    anything like normal operating expenses. Just about every action that the
                    government needed to take in support of the agriculture sector misfired. A
                    common ingredient in each instance was the insufficiency of government operating
                    funds and foreign exchange. Thus fertilizer and other inputs never arrived until
                    after the growing season, roads didn't receive maintenance in time to prevent
                    their washing out during the rainy season. Except in a few areas (Ghana Airways,
                    the State Transport bus line, radio, television) public sector equipment was
                    non-operational or highly unreliable. Every time we wanted to take a field trip
                    with our counterparts, we had to cover their expenses with project funds. It
                    never occurred to the government - or with much force to the donor community
                    until rather late in the NLC's tenure - that it might make sense to give greater
                    scope for markets to allocate resources and for the private sector to play a
                    markedly larger role in the economy.</p>
                <p>But anticipation of the 1969 election was a significant influence on the NLC's
                    management of the economy.</p>

                <p>GILBERT: Anyway the politics of the electoral campaign were quite nasty. It was
                    really amazing to me to talk to some of my Ghanaian friends. One of the two
                    major parties contesting the 1969 electio- I think it was called the Progress
                    Party - represented the better element of the Nkrumah forces. It was headed
                    Komla Gbedemah, who had been Nkrumah's Finance Minister until he resigned on
                    principle. The other important party was that headed by Professor K.A. Busia. It
                    represented the people who regarded themselves as the natural leaders of the
                    country. They tended to come from privileged, and often chiefly, backgrounds and
                    were often highly educated and very impressive people. Talking about the
                    election and the two parties with my Ghanaian friendwho were mostly from elite
                    backgrounds - was disconcerting. They saw the contest as one between the forces
                    of good and evil. They couldn't say enough about the wickedness of the Gbedemah
                    party and believed that an election result that produced victory for them would
                    be unacceptable and couldn't be allowed to stand. Busia himself was a man of
                    powerful intellect, but rather priggish and cold. He was inclined to prattle on
                    about democracy and the rule of law. He certainly had few of the attributes of a
                    popular leader. He gave the impression that the main question to be decided by
                    the election was his own and his party's suitability or worthiness and their
                    opponents' lack of it. The Busia forces won the election and then proceeded to
                    provide the country with poor government complete with flouting of the
                    constitution and the rights of the opposition members of the Parliament.</p>
                <p>But before all that happened the prospect of the 1969 elections had a negative
                    impact on NLC economic policies. I believe it's fair to say that men who favored
                    the Busia forces dominated the NLC. Certainly the majority didn't want the other
                    side to win. And I think they did the classic thing. They eased up on the
                    austerity aspect of the economic program. Even though the allocation of import
                    licenses and foreign exchange increasingly favored imports of consumer goods,
                    inflation increased, and it became more and more apparent that the economy was
                    slipping more and more out of balance.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>And this trend continued after the Busia government came into power. The Harvard
                    planning advisory group had been saying from the beginning that a major
                    devaluation together with liberalizing reforms were urgently needed. They and, I
                    believe, the “vanguard” of the donor community tried to convince the Busia
                    government that this should be done early, during its honeymoon phase, when it
                    would go down easier and they would have longer to reap the reward of an
                    improved economy. But they would have none of it. Meanwhile the economy got
                    worse and worse. This continued until...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: January 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That's right. I was in Nigeria by then. But the devaluation occurred
                    during the holiday season. There was precious little advance planning; I believe
                    the Harvard team was even caught quite by surprise. One of the glaring errors
                    was that the devaluation was only announced, not really explained to the
                    country. This triggered a coup. And so not even two years after the return to
                    civilian rule, Ghana found itself again ruled by a military junta, and by one
                    whose members fell considerably short of matching the NLC in ability and
                    unselfishness.</p>
                <p>Having taken my generals and being thus eligible to do so, I had been thinking
                    about writing a doctoral dissertation on some aspect of the attempt to restart
                    economic development in Ghana. I had been reading and considering various
                    topics, but had not managed to develop a proposal that both had scholarly merit
                    and feasibility in terms of the availability of data, magnitude of the task,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>That was the state of play when I was assigned to Nigeria. When I discovered
                    there that my work was at least as demanding as it had been in Ghana, I dithered
                    for six months and then threw up my hands. I wrote to my thesis committee at
                    Fletcher to thank them for their patience (they had extended my eligibility) and
                    formally renounced my intent to prepare a thesis. Rob West, my thesis director,
                    was a Fletcher professor who had been Mission Director in Congo a few years
                    earlier. I thought he would thank me for being so straightforward about the
                    matter, but instead he used a visit to Lagos on some other business to also
                    cajole me into staying the course. I owe him a great deal for that. But the
                    other reason I persevered was that my Ghana experience nagged at me. It was my
                    first practical experience as a development practitioner (or, more accurately, a
                    witness), and I wanted to understand what had gone wrong in Ghana during this
                    period and what lessons could be drawn from the experience.</p>
                <p>So thanks to a then brand new element in AID's staff training program, I was
                    given six months at Fletcher with pay to do research and writing. I took an
                    additional three months of leave without pay to complete a full academic year.
                    That was during the academic year 1973/74.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your dissertation on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, the title was “The Distributive Effects of Economic Policy during
                    a Period of Stabilization and Reform: Ghana 1966-1969”. And one of the first
                    things I discovered was that I didn't have a good fix at all at the time on
                    whether the stabilization program was on track. And, unless I was completely out
                    of the loop, the same was also true of the other staff in the USAID Mission.
                    This could be seen in the statistics that were available four or five years
                    later but not then. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund probably
                    knew more at the time because they typically get access to statistics long
                    before they are published for public consumption. Be that as it may, AID and the
                    other donors - whatever their misgivings - had little choice but to base their
                    decisions on how much or little confidence they had in the information and
                    analysis provided by the Bank and Fund.</p>
                <p>With hindsight, you could see that the program was slipping off track by late
                    1967. I didn't think to look at this again before I came down here. But I
                    divided it into two periods. During the first period they stayed largely on
                    track. I think that period ended in the fall of 1967. And you could see that
                    from then on the benefits of economic policy decisions favored efficient
                    resource use less and less and furthered political and social objectives more
                    and more. I don't think the change in economic decision-making had much to do
                    with explicit corruption - at least, not in the upper echelons of the
                    government.</p>
                <p>The elections and the consequent desire to ease austerity was only part of the
                    picture. Equally or more important, in my view, is the degree to which this
                    particular military government was subject to “popular” political and social
                    pressure. In truth the pressure probably came mainly from the elites, the urban
                    middle class and modern sector wage earners.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Drawing on Sammy Gaisie's demographic survey results, I could appreciate how few
                    people at each age-level there were in Ghana who completed secondary and higher
                    levels of education. Most of those who subsequently gained standing in the
                    public service or in the commercial life of the country had attended five or six
                    elite secondary schools, of which at least three are located in Cape Coast.
                    After that, many would have attended the University of Ghana or the Kumasi
                    University of Science and Technology. Thus, in Ghana the elite were absolutely
                    as well as relatively few, had shared many life experiences and were very likely
                    to know one another directly or by name and reputation or by knowing the family
                    to which an individual belonged. In such a society one of the most commonly
                    heard conversational themes among the elite is that an individual knows someone
                    in a position of influence who can broker a solution to some problem or other.
                    Moreover, the NLC had set a timetable for elections leading to a return to
                    civilian government. And, as I mentioned earlier, a majority among them wished
                    to see the anti-Nkrumah party come to power. So, even though no military
                    government can be called democratic, it seems to me that the NLC was
                    representative in the sense that circumstances required it to take account of,
                    and factor into their decisions, pressures and constraints arising from public
                    opinion. In this way, they were not in a very different position from that of an
                    elected government facing an election. Little by little, they gave way to
                    interest group pressures from upper and middle ranges of the socioeconomic
                    scale. Perhaps, just perhaps, if they had been clearly aware how much the
                    cumulative effect of some of these decisions would cost in foregone economic
                    stabilization and reform, then they might have actually steered a somewhat
                    different course. But they were individually ill equipped to gauge what was
                    happening, and it is doubtful that any technocrats who might have understood
                    were sufficiently disinterested and “staunch” to tell them what they probably
                    didn't want to hear. Most NLC members saw their mission as mainly one of putting
                    an end to “wickedness” and corruption that occurred because the wrong element of
                    society - the “half-educated,” “upstart” people who predominated among those
                    attracted to Nkrumagained power following independence. For these members
                    improving economic conditions was essential to the political aim of preventing
                    history from repeating itself. For them the need for economic reform and
                    restructuring was something like a religious verity that they needed to
                    acknowledge though they hardly understood it in practical terms. It was
                    analogous to “Mom, God and apple pie.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any views in your thesis about what policies
                        might have been appropriate for better distribution and all that? Or was
                        that not what you were focusing on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, from an economic perspective one could see that opening things up
                    to the market would have been better. They also should have been more ruthless
                    in getting out of state enterprises instead of allowing that element of their
                    program to stall after two or three relatively inconsequential spinoffs. And if
                    they had handled those decisions more transparently, the question of
                    privatization might not have become too hot to handle.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In particular, they should have been more ruthless in getting out of the
                    import-competing manufacturing sector - either letting it sink or swim. And they
                    should have been much more aggressive in promoting agriculture through a
                    combination of economic incentives and liberalization of markets as well as
                    privatization of agricultural processing and input distribution functions. A lot
                    of these ideas were “out there”; I surely didn't invent them. But nobody in the
                    World Bank or in AID was talking about them that much in those days as I recall.
                    There were consultants in the picture - people like Scott Pearson, Gus Ranis and
                    the members of the Harvard Team who were talking and writing about these needs -
                    but I think it fair to say that the Ghanaians studiously, though politely,
                    ignored them most of the time. Neither the World Bank nor the Fund openly
                    advocated putting much pressure on the government to adopt more far-reaching
                    reforms. To make them politically feasible would have required developing
                    sensitive policies and implementation strategies in secret from the public but
                    in close collaboration with the donor representatives. This would have required
                    stronger Ghanaian economic analytical and decision-making capacities as well as
                    more trust and frankness than actually prevailed between the Ghanaian
                    authorities and the World Bank and the Fund. It would also have required more
                    resources than the donors were then furnishing. Moreover, the Bank and Fund may
                    have sensed a donor consensus that the outcome of the 1969 elections, rather
                    than that of the economic program, was the main concern.</p>
                <p>We need to recall that these issues were coming to a head at a time when AID was
                    on the threshold of a decision to reduce its economics staff and rely instead on
                    the Bank and the Fund for economic analysis and related program guidance. At the
                    same time AID, the Bank and many other donors decided to focus assistance on the
                    poor majority - a concept that swiftly degenerated, at least within AID, to
                    become a preoccupation in the minds of many with “the poorest of the poor.” And
                    AID essentially went on an “autopilot”...</p>

                    remember writing a paper on monitoring and evaluation that was published in the
                    proceedings of a symposium on population and demographic issues. I just had too
                    much on my plate, and - since AID was just formulating its approach - there was
                    little actual doctrine to guide a new evaluation officer. I think being named
                    evaluation officer mainly meant that one was required to undergo training in
                    AID's evolving methodology.</p>

                <p>GILBERT: Oh, yeah! Gee, agriculture! In agriculture we had a program focused, in
                    effect, on extension. We also had an agricultural education program that trained
                    non-degree extension people. We were involved in five or six agricultural
                    training schools around the country. We also had people working in several
                    regional offices as advisors to the extension service. And, after I had been in
                    country for a while, I formed a strong impression that our people were simply
                    helping the Ministry of Agriculture to do a little of this and that. This was
                    when the miracle rice and wheat varieties were making such an impact in Southern
                    Asia and the Far East. And some of the new rice varieties were undergoing
                    adaptive trials in Ghana. I believe there were also some significantly
                    higher-yielding maize varieties being tried out. Meanwhile it seemed that
                    extension service was simply marking time. Bob Jackson and I...</p>

                    when you meet a guy like Bob Jackson early in your career. Bob makes me think of
                    our cook-steward in Ghana, Jonathan Tonaria, an Ijaw from Nigeria. He was
                    certainly one of the two best cook-stewards that we ever had. And I didn't
                    appreciate either Jonathan or Bob Jackson then as much as I would later when I
                    discovered what rare jewels they each were.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I worked closely with Bob in developing an idea that we came to call the “Focus
                    and Concentrate” approach. (Some wags soon dubbed it “Search and Destroy” after
                    a military program in Vietnam.) At that time we had an extension project that
                    involved encouraging farmers to plant certain improved varieties, to use certain
                    fertilizer applications and to follow certain methods of cultivation (called
                    cultural practices, by the technicians). But all this was pretty theoretical
                    since half the time neither the recommended seeds nor the right kinds and
                    amounts of fertilizer were available. If that weren't enough, the extension
                    officers often weren't disseminating the currently approved advice. Of course,
                    they mostly couldn't get out and give demonstrations and provide advice -
                    whether correct or incorrect - because they didn't have working vehicles and, if
                    they did, couldn't get the funds they needed to operate them. Per Diem was out
                    of the question. I'm sure I'm forgetting the half of it.</p>
                <p>So, we decided to select one district in each of the four regions that we were
                    involved in and make a point of getting all the elements together in these
                    districts so that we could demonstrate the benefits that would accrue. We also
                    thought that trying to make this work in four “focus and concentrate” areas
                    would yield lessons that would enable replication to proceed more efficiently
                    later on. As this implies, we knew that there would be problems to learn from.
                    But we underestimated the difficulties enormously.</p>
                <p>We worked at this for several years. We - at least some of us (but probably not
                    Bob Jackson) - thought we could make it work if we tried hard enough. After all,
                    all the elements that needed to come together - improved seed varieties, correct
                    cultural practices and fertilizer application recommendations, agricultural
                    inputs, mechanization services and even transportation of produce to markets -
                    were within the management control of the government. Our USAID extension
                    advisors and our Mission management team worked with Ghanaians on this for
                    years.</p>
                <p>We could never get the Ministry of Agriculture systems to perform in even a rough
                    approximation of the way they should have. If the research institute provided
                    the foundation seed, then the multiplication process would break down -
                    especially since this had to be done on state farms on a mechanized basis.
                    State-owned tractors were always in need of unavailable spare parts and
                    operating funds. If somehow the seed actually got multiplied, then it either
                    wouldn't get transported or would be poorly stored and therefore go bad or would
                    get distributed to the farmers too late in the planting season and simply get
                    eaten.</p>
                <p>If by some miracle the seed got out to the farmers, then the fertilizer would
                    certainly fail to be there. The government bought the fertilizer so the farmers
                    would not be “victimized by wicked middle men.” But even if the government
                    budgeted adequately for the fertilizer, then the actual release of funds would
                    be late. If and when the funds were released, then getting the necessary foreign
                    exchange allocation from the Central Bank would prove a problem. Delays in
                    ordering the fertilizer would cause it to arrive in the middle of the growing
                    season rather than when needed. Since it would be raining and storage (or even
                    clearance from the docks) was always problematic, fertilizer frequently spoiled
                    and turned into something resembling concrete.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Meanwhile it would turn out that the extension staff didn't have the means of
                    getting to the field. If they had vehicles, the vehicles would need spare parts.
                    If the vehicles were functioning, then they couldn't get funds released to
                    operate them. Should they get to the field, extension advice tended to be so
                    standardized that the recommended fertilizer applications and cultural practices
                    didn't take into account regional variations in soil types and
                    agro-climatological conditions.</p>
                <p>Murphy's law operates everywhere. But in the third world its effect is squared
                    and in a third world government setting its effect is cubed.</p>
                <p>Trying to make this thing work was great fun in that it gave me reason to get out
                    of the office and to get to know our agriculture field staff and their
                    counterparts. This provided me with some of the happiest moments and the most
                    useful learning experiences - not to mention valued personal relationships - of
                    my career. The one with whom I became most friendly was Quincy Benbow, an
                    African-American from South Carolina. He, his wife, Annabelle, and their kids
                    lived in Ho, the capital of the Volta Region. Two others were fellow Norwegian
                    Americans from North Dakota and Minnesota: Jim Flaa and Wayne Slotten. From
                    these guys I learned the difference between analytical and conceptual ability,
                    on one hand, and practical wisdom, on the other. It was only later that it
                    dawned on me that even though I almost always “won” my arguments with them, it
                    turned out that their positions proved more often right than mine. This caused
                    me to make a point in my later career of reminding others and myself over and
                    over again that we need to be careful not to win arguments that we should lose.
                    Unfortunately, I sometimes forgot to follow this advice myself.</p>
                <p>We had some limited success with the “focus and concentrate” program, but that
                    was achieved because the American extension advisors and their counterparts
                    would short-circuit the government systems to the point that they would haul
                    seed and fertilizer to cooperating farmers in their pickups and that sort of
                    thing. I don't think they ever seriously believed that “focus and concentrate”
                    meant very much or would succeed. And they weren't trying to fool anybody. They
                    simply cared about the farmers that they worked with and wanted to help them as
                    much as possible. I'm not sure that I really drew the proper - now obvious -
                    conclusions until after I saw somewhat the same thing happening in Nigeria - a
                    country whose economy was much more functional and, compared to Ghana's, even
                    prosperous.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Somehow the idea that the private sector, in that setting, should be allowed to
                    handle the distribution and marketing of agricultural inputs, services and
                    products seemed farfetched or extreme even when confronted with such massive
                    evidence that the government could never manage it. I excuse myself and others
                    to some extent because the visible private sector mainly consisted of
                    large-scale international, mostly British, trading companies and small scale,
                    mostly Greek and Lebanese, traders. Rightly or wrongly, both sectors were
                    regarded with skepticism. The big trading companies didn't have a network that
                    reached to the grass roots and the small-scale guys had a reputation for being
                    “predatory”. Of course, making the transition has turned out in fact to be far
                    from simple. The private sector won't handle inputs on a completely commercial
                    (as opposed to a contract) basis at reasonable cost until they have confidence
                    in that government's intentions to abandon its involvement is firm. Demonizing
                    the private sector was the cornerstone of the whole panoply of “London School of
                    Economics” economic policies that most Anglophone countries followed after
                    independence. And strange as it may seem now, one could not - even with the help
                    of someone like Gus Ranis - have a genuine give and take discussion about it
                    with civil servants or their bosses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved at all in introducing the cultivation of
                        high-yielding rice varieties into Ghana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I can remember there was a lot of discussion of this within the USAID
                    Mission and among the Ghanaian agricultural establishment. This was just when
                    some of the Green Revolution varieties were becoming available from the
                    International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. There was a big
                    convocation at the Ambassador Hotel where all the folks from the whole
                    agriculture establishment of the country were present, including professors from
                    the university. And there was a heated discussion of the merits of long versus
                    short grain rice. I think this was because the highest yielding varieties were
                    short grain and not what the Ghanaians were used to. Frank Pinder, USAID Mission
                    Director, got so exasperated that he took the floor and said that if they didn't
                    stop being so fussy and just get on with growing some kind of rice that they
                    were going wind up “eating their grandpappies” in a few years. (Laughs) He was
                    the only person who could have gotten away with saying such a thing. No one got
                    mad. Instead, they took his point and tried harder to move forward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a conference that he had organized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe so. I'm having a hard time remembering the exact context. It
                    might have been something we did in collaboration with the Ford Foundation.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I think we were trying to encourage them to use the new varieties to grow more
                    rice. And one of the key constraints was rice milling. They had somehow acquired
                    four state-owned rice mills either through supplier credits or through some kind
                    of aid and trade deals with the Eastern Bloc. I think they might have come from
                    East Germany. And they couldn't make the damn things work efficiently due to
                    spare parts problems. Also, as I recall, they couldn't attract paddy from
                    farmers at the price they could pay and still break even. This, in turn, had a
                    lot to do with the Government's policy concerning rice imports as well as
                    exchange rate and import duty policy. The alternative to using these rice mills
                    was to use small scale, artisanal private mills. But rice milled by this method
                    had to be parboiled first. This gave the rice a taste that was unacceptable to
                    urban consumers. I'm sure urban consumers were used to imported ricthey got
                    Uncle Ben's under PL 480 Title I. Anyway it was something that went on for
                    several years and was never resolved. Do you remember anything about that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No. But there were issues about taste and consistency and
                        so on. This complicated decisions concerning what kind of rice to grow and
                        how to process it.But I don't remember the details. At any rate, any other
                        dimensions from the Ghana experience? You can add them later if you
                        like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it was my first post, and, like many before me, I fell in love
                    with the Ghanaians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask you how did you find the Ghanaian
                        people to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: They were my first Africans... actually, my first Third World people.
                    And again, sometimes you don't appreciate something really precious until later
                    when you acquire more perspective. And it was only later that I fully
                    appreciated the Ghanaians. One of their more interesting characteristics is
                    their relative freedom from complexes about themselves in relation to the rest
                    of the world — in particular, the white world. There are always exceptions to
                    every generalization, but for the most part they seem to have a degree of
                    self-confidence and self-esteem that permits them to accept outsiders, including
                    white outsiders, on a friendly and straightforward basis. By straightforward I
                    mean with very little, if any, suspicion, disdain or deference. I am, of course,
                    talking about the educated people. From the uneducated - especially servants -
                    one might get the same kind of wheedling, favor — and patronage — seeking
                    behavior that can be very tiresome in other parts of Africa. But with those on a
                    comparable socioeconomic level with us, it was possible to form friendships that
                    were not about anything except our enjoyment of one another's company. I never
                    experienced that on a broad scale again in Africa except, very unexpectedly, in
                    Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with them as regards getting
                        things done?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, like all of God's “chillun”, they talked better than they
                    performed. On average, they were probably a little more afflicted with a
                    disparity between what they say and what they do than Americans. But one would
                    have to grant also that they were awfully damn articulate, and excellent
                    debaters. Others and myself observed that something - whether education or
                    culture or, more likely, a combination of the two - made them extremely good “in
                    committee” as the Brits say.</p>
                <p>Another thing I find interesting to look back on is the climate of intellectual
                    freedom that prevailed even though coming out of a dictatorship and despite
                    being under a military government during three of my four plus years there. I
                    found that they were extremely frank. I also felt that most of their
                    disagreements with us and among themselves were of a pretty high quality.</p>
                <p>The main negative observation I had about Ghanaian society was the “zero-sum
                    game” behavior I referred to earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you saw that as pervasive in the upper caste
                        society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Especially in the government context. And it generated jealousy toward
                    people who got ahead. I don't suppose it was worse there than in other
                    countries, but my first encounter with it was in Ghana. I don't want to dwell on
                    that. The main thing is that in Ghana in those days I met some of the most
                    outstanding and attractive personalities I have ever known in my life. You and I
                    both know many of those people. Mary Chinery-Hesse, Sam Ofosu-Armah, Fred Sai
                    and Alex Kwapong, to name a few. And then there were many others who were just
                    extraordinarily good, hardworking people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much connection with the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The first Ambassador was Franklin Williams. That was kind of a tough
                    time because he and Frank Pinder couldn't abide one another. And that meant that
                    people like Gordon Evans and I on the AID side and Jack Foley, the DCM, and
                    Charles Adams, the Economic Section Chief, on the Embassy side did a lot more
                    running back and forth than maybe we would have needed to do otherwise. And it
                    wasn't much fun since, all too often, we became the bearers of unwelcome
                    news.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: He was a political appointee and, as Dick Cashin once said, you would
                    have thought that he had a lot to be happy about in life. He had had a very
                    distinguished career up until then. But you had the feeling that he was quite
                    bitter - that something was gnawing at him. He seemed to be very paranoid; I
                    suppose, you can't divorce all that from the context of the time... But this was
                    before the assassination of Martin Luther King.</p>
                <p>Maybe it was mostly that he and Frank Pinder really had a bitter relationship,
                    but I don't think it was that simple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were both black Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: They were both black Americans. Whatever his background, Frank Williams
                    gave the impression of being very elite — today, some might say he was “preppy.”
                    And I'm sure he had gone to all the right schools. He was an extremely bright
                    and socially polished, though somewhat edgy, individual. And Frank Pinder was a
                    savvy guy who liked to present himself as “down home.” It was quite some time
                    before Gordon Evans showed me in the “stud book” that he had received a Masters
                    Degree from Cornell. He used to say things like, “That's all right for you fancy
                    pants college boys, but I went to the Lucy Lydy Institute.” That is very close
                    to a direct quote. I don't know what the hell the “Lucy Lydy Institute” was but
                    it was certainly meant to betoken to us some sort of third or fourth rate
                    educational background. Frank Pinder had a warm personality and, at least
                    compared to Frank Williams, was folksy. And he was a guy who was in touch with
                    his roots. And I'm trying to remember if he always spoke grammatical English. I
                    think he pretty much did, but still he was kind of a mainstream guy in his
                    cultural context.</p>
                <p>And the Ghanaians worshipped Frank Pinder. He had been there since ...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it is good to talk about Frank Pinder, because he
                        is one of the first in the world to work on international development in
                        Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes and, as I was saying, he had been in Ghana for a very long time. He
                    had been the Food and Agricultural Officer, I think, when the program was very
                    small during the Nkrumah period. He had had a close relationship with Nkrumah. I
                    don't think Frank particularly agreed with much that Nkrumah did on the economic
                    and agricultural fronts, but I believe that Nkrumah valued his opinion. I
                    suppose that the Frank's advice was usually sought on fairly specific technical
                    issues rather than on broader, more political and strategic issues. And so here
                    was a new Ambassador who arrived in Accra and found that his AID director —
                    whose antecedents seemed inferior — had more standing and influence in many
                    quarters of the Ghanaian establishment than he did. The Ghanaians eventually
                    learned to check their tendency to look around when Frank Williams turned up
                    some place and ask if Frank Pinder was also coming, but, by the time they did
                    so, it was too late. And by then Frank Williams had gotten such a belly full,
                    that he didn't want Pinder to get out of his box at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I was raised in the South and whenever I saw a house with a lot of cars out in
                    front my reaction was that somebody had just died. And, if you went by the
                    Pinders' house on Saturday or Sunday, it always, but always, looked like someone
                    had just died. And it would not be because he or anyone else had done anything
                    extravagant, let alone die. It was simply that he was at home on the weekends
                    and all kinds of people - often people from upcountry agricultural research
                    stations, agricultural colleges, the extension service offices or the
                    universities at Cape Coast or Kumasi - would come by, not only to pay their
                    respects, but to actually get advice about some technical matter or a personal
                    issue such as which college their kids should apply to if they could afford to
                    send them to the U.S. or, notwithstanding everything I said earlier about the
                    Ghanaian elite, to ask for favors. Frank Pinder was viewed as an influential
                    person and someone who could broker solutions to sticky problems within the
                    Ghanaian public service structure. I believe he had worked for years in Liberia
                    before coming to Ghana. I also think he came from at least a middle class
                    Southern black background. For whatever reasons, he relished this sort of thing
                    and handled it very well. And, from the Ghanaian perspective, I think he took on
                    the aura of a traditional chief. In African traditional life many fairly
                    mundane-seeming problems are brought to the traditional chief and elders for
                    advice or decision. Frank took this role very seriously. Which reminds me, my
                    experience was that the Americans who were most successful at developing rapport
                    with the local people were southerners - whether black or white. I think Frank
                    Pinder was from the south, but I also remember hearing that he had roots were in
                    the Caribbean. That would mean that he got that touch from two sources. But even
                    so, he was in a league of his own. Most of us who come from north of the
                    Mason-Dixon line, tend to put simply “being there” for their fellow man pretty
                    far down on their priority list. But in the South - especially in rural areas -
                    investing in social and community relationships even at the cost of one's
                    personal plans of the moment or even the day has retained a higher priority even
                    during recent times than in, say, the rural North (where it definitely has a
                    higher priority than in the urban North). This enables Southerners to be more
                    genuinely graceful or even sincerely welcoming if people just drop in or if they
                    bring uninvited guests to social functions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Nothing comes immediately to mind. You know, the personality factor was
                    so strong that it may have overshadowed the real substance of some of these
                    issues.</p>

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, there was always friction because our regulations and procedures
                    caused us to be unresponsive to Embassy “priorities du jour”. But as I recall,
                    the unpleasantness seemed mostly about operational coordination. For example,
                    one my earliest memories after arriving in Ghana was that there was to be a
                    Trade Fair. It was decided that AID would have an exhibit. I was the lucky duck
                    charged with coordinating with the technical divisions on its content. I
                    remember tangling with a member of the Ag staff who wanted to have our exhibit
                    be a demonstration of artificial insemination. I had to tell him that the
                    average city-dwelling Ghanaians probably would not react as we might wish to a
                    guy with his arm buried up to the shoulder in the rear end of a cow. I was
                    capable of formulating this thought myself, but I remember it now in the context
                    of playing a mediating role between Embassy “big picture” and AID technical
                    propensities. I think that it might be a pretty representative example. As I
                    recall, the Embassy's “big picture” concerns were not as substantive as I came
                    to expect later. It is also possible that I was too low on the totem pole to be
                    privy to the really substantive issues and tensions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the self-help fund management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Not particularly. I can't remember that there was much of a problem.
                    Whereas self-help program management was later handed to the Embassies, during
                    my days in Ghana it was firmly in AID hands. Bob Rose had primary responsibility
                    as I recall. He was the mission's chief engineer. During most of my time we held
                    weekly implementation committee meetings. Once we were done with the part of the
                    meeting that had to do with the Commodity Import Program (CIP or Program Loan),
                    Bob Rose would walk us through whatever questions had to be decided concerning
                    self-help project proposals. I was always struck by the fact that each agenda
                    item received very close to the same amount of attention even though the Program
                    Loan allocations typically concerned hundreds of thousands of dollars while the
                    Self-Help Project proposals seldom concerned more that one thousand.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>And I can remember that one of the recurrent features of the Self-Help Project
                    was that we financed construction of municipal public latrines. One of these was
                    in Wenchi where Landon Holman was one of our Agricultural Education Advisors. He
                    lobbied for it long and hard. At one point he argued that it was necessary so
                    that the sight of so many people urinating in public wouldn't coarsen Mrs.
                    Holman's sensibilities. This proposal became known in USAID Accra as the “Landon
                    Holman Place of Public Convenience.” Thereafter, the idea of municipal latrines
                    sort of caught on. There was a young Catholic missionary brother up country who
                    got involved. His name was something like Brother Adrian. And I remember being
                    treated in one of these meetings to a letter from Brother Adrian concerning the
                    justification for one of his proposed latrines. It was a report of his having
                    loitered in a nearby lorry park for four or five hours in order to observe the
                    operation of the single existing latrine. He submitted tables and graphs based
                    on his observations of the number of people who went in and the approximate time
                    each spent in the latrine. This is how he was able to say with authority how
                    many holes were needed in the new one. Brother Adrian had a good sense of humor,
                    as does Bob Rose. And this was Brother Adrian's way of telling Bob he was asking
                    too many questions. They became good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were ten or twenty-five thousand-dollar
                        projects.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: As I recall, these were usually no more than two or three
                    thousand-dollar projects. The average allocation of Special Self Help funds for
                    each Mission was about $25,000 annually in the early days. Since then, the
                    allocations have increased.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think about that kind of a program? Was it
                        worthwhile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I'm not sure what I thought of it at that point. I guess I thought it
                    was a nice public relations gesture, but a pain in the neck from a management
                    perspective. I remember thinking how lucky we were to have a guy like Bob Rose
                    with broad enough shoulders, enough humor and enough talent - coupled with good
                    horse sense - to be able to handle the job without letting it drive out too much
                    other useful work.</p>
                <p>But later on someone hit on the ingenious idea of developing detailed
                    ground-rules and criteria so that it could be largely administered by Embassies.
                    I remember that it took some hapless fellow (think he was an AID guy seconded to
                    State) a long time to develop these instructions and negotiate the agreement
                    between State and AID. It didn't take me long to conclude that, for a couple of
                    hundred thousand dollars per country, it was a very good way to keep peace
                    between AID and State. Forgive me, this is an unworthy thought, but it seemed to
                    me that an awful lot of tension between Ambassadors and AID Mission Directors
                    boiled down to visibility issues. And the Self-Help Projects provided lots of
                    opportunities for Ambassadors to cut ribbons and give speeches.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the sources of friction between the Ambassador and
                        Frank Pinder was over the self-help fund because the Ambassador wanted to
                        use it for political kinds of things that Frank Pinder didn't approve
                        of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I guess I remember that, now that you mention it. Of course, clear-cut
                    rules helped eventually to eliminate that kind of conflict. There may have been
                    something about that in the guidelines even then. But another problem then was
                    that Mission Directors were mainly accountable for compliance. I think the
                    subsequent guidelines made Ambassadors mainly accountable. I think it may have
                    been only at that point that it became known as the Ambassador's Special
                    Self-Help Project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the commodity import program? Was that useful,
                        effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The commodity import program was largely used to finance spare parts and
                    intermediate goods in order to boost capacity utilization in the manufacturing
                    sector. The PL-480 Title I Program was also used for that purpose. (Ghana was
                    certainly the first country where PL 480 Title I was used to import gray cloth
                    so that the local textile mills could bleach and print it.) The main aim was to
                    maintain levels of production and employment in the domestic manufacturing
                    sector. It was largely effective from that standpoint. The manufacturing sector
                    had been surveyed following the coup to identify the factories that should be
                    scrapped or mothballed pending privatization. But this survey couldn't be very
                    rigorous owing to time pressures. Therefore, it should have been no surprise
                    when it eventually emerged that many of these firms being kept afloat by the CIP
                    and PL 480 Title I programs were not competitive. The infant industry argument
                    can justify protecting initially inefficient industries provided that they have
                    the potential to achieve competitiveness. But that argument couldn't be
                    sustained for many of the industries based on Domestic Resource Cost (DRC)
                    analysis. The DRC method analyzes industries in terms of the economic (rather
                    than nominal) costs of the resources they use. It takes into account the extent
                    to which a currency is overvalued, which artificially lowers nominal imported
                    capital and input costs. Output is valued at the world price of comparable
                    imports. For many, if not most, of the firms in Ghana's modern manufacturing
                    sector at that time, this revealed that they were producing negative or marginal
                    value added. The World Bank and the IMF probably had the access to the data and
                    the staff capability to conduct this kind of analysis after the initial planning
                    phase (say, six months) of the post coup stabilization program. I don't know if
                    they did or not. My first appreciation of the situation came from a study that
                    William F. Steel conducted and eventually turned into his Ph.D. dissertation for
                    MIT. That would have been after 1968.</p>

                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>GILBERT: No, and they were not industries that merited a place in Ghana's
                    long-term future. Reasonable people can differ on whether it was necessary to
                    maintain production and employment during this period. We have to bear in mind
                    that this period followed ten years of Nkrumah's experiment with African
                    Socialism. During that period there was rapid expansion of the parastatal
                    manufacturing, agriculture and mining sectors. The numerous employees of these
                    enterprises benefitted from levels of consumption made possible by subsidies to
                    their enterprises and by the increasingly overvalued exchange rate, which made
                    imports artificially cheap in local currency terms. The donors and, therefore,
                    the World Bank and IMF wanted to promote a political transition to a stable and
                    moderately neutral, if not specifically pro-Western, democracy. This goal could
                    be jeopardized if Ghanaians, especially the more educated and urban dwelling
                    elements, were subjected to a harsh adjustment process.</p>
                <p>I don't think the donors as a group fully appreciated the economic cost of
                    maintaining modern sector domestic production and employment. To the extent the
                    economic issues became better understood, say during late 1967 and 1968, the
                    political dimension was becoming more salient because there had been an
                    attempted coup, and elections for the return to civilian rule loomed closer and
                    closer. I think the need for fundamental economic liberalization and
                    restructuring became quite well understood beginning sometime in mid-to-late
                    1968, but by 1969 the donors were dealing with a democratically elected civilian
                    regime that was not able to understand, and distinctly unwilling to deal with,
                    the issue. They stonewalled until Christmas 1971 when they launched draconian
                    measures that took virtually no account of the political dimension and led to a
                    military coup. Of course, by that time the economic imbalances had become much
                    larger, and therefore needed much more painful measures, than would have been
                    the case had they acted one or two years earlier.</p>

                <p>GILBERT: I just thought of something else that we were doing? Well, we had an
                    activity with the Volta River Authority (VRA) that involved their use of U.S.
                    counterpart local currency for implementation of a program supported technically
                    by a man named Phil Pierce. His work took place during a period when the Volta
                    Lake had only recently filled to a much higher level following completion of the
                    Volta Dam at Akosambo. He was a fisheries biologist and was helping the VRA with
                    the technical problems and opportunities pertaining to the mainly artisanal
                    fishing industry on the Lake. One of the main issues he helped with was a bit
                    peripheral to his original mission; it involved control of the snail that was
                    vector of schistosomiasis (or bilharzia) on the lakeshore. This became an
                    important issue because the Lake's expansion brought both itself and the disease
                    to a large number of people not used to either. The VRA also had responsibility
                    for the welfare of the in-place populations newly on the margins of the lake and
                    for those displaced as the Lake filled. As I recall, this meant that the VRA was
                    responsible for schools and health services as well as agricultural and
                    fisheries extension services for well over a million people. It probably doesn't
                    redound greatly to the discredit of the VRA that the resettlement program for
                    the displaced was widely considered to be a mess. I've never heard of a
                    successful program of that type. The VRA had a great deal of technical
                    assistance in the planning and execution of the resettlement program so the
                    approach that largely failed had solid international credentials.</p>
                <p>The schisto problem was just one element of a large-scale demonstration of the
                    law of unintended consequences. Another example was that that there was a
                    terrific explosion of the fish population. At the same time the mix of fish
                    species was changing. And you would think then, that this would be a great boon,
                    but it wasn't. It was extremely hard for the fisher-folk to adapt to the new
                    picture since it made their techniques obsolete. I can't remember the “ins and
                    outs” of it, but it was a great lesson. It prepared me to understand the utility
                    of social soundness and environmental impact assessments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Nigeria when you got there in
                        1971?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Mike Adler was still Mission Director. John Hummon was the Deputy
                    Director. I was one of several people who reported to the Assistant Director for
                    Program (AD/P). I believe that position had recently been vacated by Gordon
                    Evans. Besides my new position, the AD/P supervised a capital development staff,
                    an economics staff, a training staff and the Program Office per se, which was
                    the core and largest unit. The Program Office was headed by a Chief. As I
                    recall, Bob Huesmann was Chief of the Program Office and Acting Assistant
                    Director for Program. (It's possible that Bob had been confirmed in the AD/P
                    role). Dennis Barrett, as the most senior Assistant Program Officer, was at
                    least the Acting Chief of the Program Office and may have been confirmed in that
                    role. When Bob Huesmann left shortly after I got there, Bob Berg, head of a
                    capital development staff, served for a time as Acting Assistant Director for
                    Program. Eventually Walter Furst came out as Assistant Director for Program and
                    everyone reverted to their normal places. I was there as Program Evaluation
                    Officer and all these Program Office ructions affected me very little, except
                    that they generated uncertainties and tensions.</p>
                <p>But Mike Adler was transferred back to Washington or to another overseas
                    assignment; I can't remember which. And John Hummon was Acting Mission Director
                    for quite a long time. (I'm sorry for dredging all this uit must be like
                    listening to the “begats” in the Bible. Unfortunately, it's the way my retrieval
                    system works.) This was an extremely difficult period in the relationship
                    between the U.S. and Nigerian governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was because the U.S. government had adopted a neutral posture during
                    the civil war. To the Nigerians, that amounted to supporting Biafra. And they
                    felt, in effect, that the U.S. government owed them something like reparations.
                    They never went so far as to say that explicitly, but they made it plain that by
                    their behavior that they thought we owed them something.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, the U.S. government's collective mind was oppressed by the knowledge
                    that the Nigerians' substantial oil revenues were being largely squandered.
                    Their oil revenues made the Nigerians impervious to donor influence. That being
                    so, it was hard to justify continuing to spend heavily on a wide range of quite
                    good institutional development projects around the country. So, USAID needed to
                    phase down this technical assistance program. Meanwhile, the Nigerians felt we
                    “owed them” an increased level of assistance. When they realized which way the
                    wind was blowing, the Nigerians were resentful.AID's intent to cull and compress
                    may have a factor in the decision to add a Program Evaluation Officer to the
                    Mission's staff roster. Be that as it may, I found myself pouring my energies
                    into that process during my first year in Lagos. A schedule was set up calling
                    for me to lead evaluations of most technical assistance projects. I spent a lot
                    of time on Nigeria Airways that year. I also met a lot of new peoplmost of whom
                    were less than pleased to see me coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doing these evaluations yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes and no. I was the point person in USAID Nigeria, but the methodology
                    called for the evaluation process to be participatornot just for warm fuzziness'
                    sake but because one couldn't hope to get it right without the cooperation of
                    the technical division and the project technical advisory team who were mostly,
                    but at this point in time, not exclusively contract people. I was also backed by
                    an embryonic evaluation staff in Washington. I was among the first group of
                    fulltime evaluation officers. We used an evaluation methodology that had been
                    developed by a contractor called Practical Concepts International (PCI). Larry
                    Posner and his colleague, Leon Rosenblum, I think, were the principals. I got to
                    know Larry pretty well. He was extremely smart and a great trainer.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>The methodology that Rosenblum and Posner developed was based on something called
                    the “logical framework” It's probably inappropriate to couch it in these terms
                    since it has literally become a household expression throughout AID and much of
                    the wider international development community. The term “innovative” was used
                    too freely and loosely even in those days. But this was truly innovative, a
                    breakthrough. Now it seems obvious that a project can't be evaluated (or even
                    properly implemented) unless there is agreement as to what problems and
                    opportunities it is directed at, how it is to affect them and how one defines
                    the desired outcome. Before then evaluations tended to focus mainly on whether
                    the inputs were delivered. The new methodology asked the additional question of
                    whether the “development hypothesis” was born out, i.e. did the inputs
                    (resources plus actions taken by the implementers) produce the predicted
                    outcome?And as I recall, Bill Kontos and Allison Herrick were the moving spirits
                    behind this in Washington. And there was a conference in Addis Ababa for the new
                    recruitmostly younger program officers - who were tasked with dealing with the
                    latest AID/W “fad”. Well, about the only good thing I could see about it at the
                    time was that I got to go to Addis to be indoctrinated. Most of us at that
                    workshop arrived highly skeptical. By the end of it, we were impressed with the
                    methodology, but still skeptical about the prospects for shoehorning the amount
                    of evaluation activity the new guidelines called for into the programming cycle.
                    Although Bill, Allison and the PCI guys all emphasized how little staff time
                    would be required, it couldn't have been more clear to us “sherpas” that they
                    were either mistaken or blowing smoke. So, when I arrived in Lagos to be one of
                    five-to-ten fulltime Program Evaluation Officers around the AID world, the only
                    preparation I had was this session in Addis. And I think I had a “handy-dandy”
                    little packet of materials.</p>
                <p>When I got to Nigeria I was pleased that the Mission actively wanted its
                    technical assistance projects evaluated. I was very busy from the get-go. I
                    remember being distressed that I didn't have time to hold up my end of the only
                    dispute I ever had with an Executive Office about an unreasonable housing
                    assignment. (I made it work by having triple-decker bunk beds made so our three
                    boys could all fit in one bedroom.)</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I remember going up to Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) at Samaru near Zaria and
                    evaluating the Kansas State University (KSU)implemented Faculty of Agriculture
                    project and the University of Pittsburgh-implemented Institute of Administration
                    project. Later on we also evaluated the ABU School of Veterinary Medicine (that
                    was delayed because KSU insisted on having an outside consultant participate on
                    the grounds that USAID had no resident veterinary expertise). We went on to
                    evaluate most of the other important projects that had significant time to run
                    (say, more than two years). It was kind of interesting because, given the need
                    to create a logical framework, you had to work with someone who could tell you
                    what the project was supposed to be about. And I'll tell you something: the
                    project documentation typical of those days wasn't much help. It was mostly just
                    “blah, blah, blah...” And it was my experience that the grumpy people you
                    started with at the beginning wound up embracing the process to the point of
                    ownership. In fact it often turned out that it was difficult to get them to stop
                    fiddling with the “Log Frame”. One had to be on the lookout against their
                    sketching out a new project design rather than using it to depict the existing
                    project concept. Try as one might, it was inevitable that creating a Log Frame
                    involved adding rigor to the project concept, but this mostly resulted in
                    “raising the bar” for the purpose of assessing project performance.</p>
                <p>The project evaluations gauged project performance, and also provided foundations
                    for project phaseout plans that would permit accomplishment of essential
                    institutionalization and capitalize on the sunk investments. Nigerian and U.S.
                    contracting institutions were usually a bit disappointed but mostly accepted the
                    outcomes as products of a collaborative exercise carried out in good faith. And
                    so that was mildly satisfying. However, there were a few cases where decisions
                    not based on our evaluations were taken by the Mission leadership. These were
                    always more draconian than we recommended. We would then have to go back to the
                    drawing boards to figure out how the decision could be respected with as little
                    as possible prejudice to the future viability of the host institution.</p>
                <p>So I did that for about a year. During that time Bill Ford replaced Mike Adler.
                    This was a big shock because most of us thought highly of John Hummon and
                    expected that he would be confirmed as Mission Director. Bill was new to AID,
                    having come from directing a large voluntary sector program in Detroit.</p>
                <p>However, Bill Ford arrived and life went on. Things were more or less okay for a
                    while. John really seemed to throw himself into working closely with Bill and
                    supporting him. To all outward appearances theirs was a good relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>But then we learned one day that Steve Christmas would be coming out to replace
                    John as Deputy Director. This was in either late 1971 or 1972. Martin Luther
                    King had been assassinated a few years before and race relations in the U.S. had
                    been inflamed ever since. For one reason or another, a large number of blacks
                    had been assigned to USAID Nigeria. I don't think it was coincidental that both
                    Bill Ford and Steve Christmas were blacks. Most of these individuals were
                    competent and, for lack of a better expression, reasonable in their publicly
                    expressed views and moderate in behavior. But a minority of Blacks within the
                    Mission were angry, not very discriminating in directing their anger and prone
                    to acting out. And I would say that the mission became fairly polarized. I'm
                    sure this was a challenge for the front office. Their efforts to deal with the
                    situation were not visible to the likes of me. The situation remained tense
                    during my whole time in Lagos, but the lid pretty much stayed on.</p>
                <p>I've always felt that it was unconscionable that the personnel system condones,
                    facilitates or promoteI don't know whicthe placement of disproportionate numbers
                    of Black staff members in units headed by Black managers. It may happen with
                    other minorities, but there haven't been many non-Black minority managers in the
                    Africa Bureau. Nor have there been many non-Black minority staff.</p>
                <p>But even if the lid stayed on in some sense, the last part of my time in Lagos
                    was one of the worst work experiences of my life. There were many dimensions to
                    this. Walter Furst, the Assistant Director for Program, disliked Nigeria and
                    didn't get along at all well with Bill Ford and Steve Christmas. He thought them
                    a bit na�ve as well as inexperienced. They in turn disliked his intellectual
                    aggressiveness and outspokenness. He bluntly challenged any proposition that
                    didn't stand up to his analysis. It had to be very tiresome, but they were wrong
                    in viewing it as insubordination (and I believe that, after a time, Bill Ford
                    came to appreciate that and hold Walter in genuine affection). Walter was a
                    product of an earlier AID culture in which the Program Officer, as the
                    development philosopher in residence, coordinated the thought processes of the
                    Mission. In that culture Program Officers who weren't confident to the point of
                    aggressiveness often got “chewed up” by their Mission Directors. Meanwhile, Bob
                    Berg - the Capital Development Officer who had acted in that position before
                    Walter arriveseemed to compete with Walter and, whether intentionally or not, to
                    undercut him occasionally in senior staff meetings. That didn't do anything to
                    improve Walter's user-friendliness. Norman Mosher was the head of an economics
                    unit that also contained Patrick Gormely.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>So things were tense enough when the departure of Dennis Barrett left the Program
                    Office Chief (head of the core staff of the Program Office) position open. I was
                    assigned to act in that position. I think Walter left before I was confirmed in
                    that position. That made me responsible for supervising five or six
                    professionals, including a training officer who had been discussed as candidate
                    for the Program Office Chief job and a couple of International Development
                    Interns (IDIs). One of these was an extremely bright and capable young Black
                    woman who was brand new to AID. It soon became obvious that the front office was
                    toying with the idea of either making her the Program Office Chief or dividing
                    things up in some way so that she would be responsible for program operations
                    and I would be responsible for evaluation and program analysis.</p>
                <p>This situation may have been the last straw for Walter, because he got himself
                    transferred back to Washington. His replacement was a much younger guy named Ed
                    Nadeau, who had been on the fast track in the Latin America Bureau. He died at
                    least ten years ago at around age 50. He was technically extremely good, a born
                    leader and little inclined to the nitty gritty of management. Like Walter before
                    him, he resisted the idea of making the young woman Chief of the Program Office.
                    The atmosphere became charged with tension. Whether or not they did so to prove
                    their case, the front office saw to it that the young woman was given some
                    challenging and high visibility special work assignments. After a few weeks she
                    suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be evacuated.</p>
                <p>I've often pondered why this happened. I don't think it was because of the tasks
                    she was given. She acquitted herself quite well. I think other sources of stress
                    were more to blame. Though somewhat troubled by mood swings, she got along well
                    with most of her Program Office colleagues - including, I think, me. She also
                    had little experience with, or stomach for, the more operational aspects of
                    program office work. This meant she would have derived little satisfaction from
                    the performance of her core responsibilities. I know she also felt conflicts
                    about being the front office candidate in opposition to several candidates,
                    including me, whose qualifications werat least, by conventional standardwere
                    objectively superior to hers. Yet, given the atmosphere in the Mission, she
                    probably didn't feel she could decline. Had she done so, she would have been
                    made to feel that she was “letting the side down”. She was the main casualty and
                    the main victim. It took a lesser toll on my bosses and me. In that atmosphere,
                    I didn't have the nerve to actively lobby for the job. I believe that my bosses,
                    Walter and Ed, favored a technically based selection. We didn't talk about it
                    much, but I feel safe in saying that it cost the three of us a lot of sleep.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the poor woman's nervous breakdown, I was confirmed in the Program
                    Office Chief position. And for the remainder of my time in Nigeria I managed the
                    Program Office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we just closing down projects or were new initiatives
                        taken?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I can't remember any initiative except the “Block Grant” that
                    AID/Washington decided should become the centerpiece of the Program once the
                    conventional program phased down. As I recall, discussions of the Block Grant
                    with the Nigerian Government started before Steve arrived. He came out on TDY to
                    discuss the concept with the Mission and the Government before he arrived as
                    Deputy. However, I don't believe active negotiations started until about
                    eighteen months after I arrived in Lagos. They were handled almost exclusively
                    by the front office and seemed to proceed in a parallel universe with little
                    Program Office involvement (although Ed Nadeau probably knew more about this
                    than I needed to know).</p>
                <p>After I took charge of the Program Office roughly at the beginning of my second
                    year in Lagos and based largely on the work I had led during that first year, we
                    had negotiated new project agreements with the government and the beneficiary
                    institutions. And we were implementing those agreements. Though they had
                    approved these packages, the Africa Bureau couldn't allocate the budgeted funds
                    on a timely basis. I sometimes had the feeling that they were trying to force us
                    to wrap these projects up faster than the revised agreements called for, but
                    this was never made explicit. I think this might have occurred during the period
                    when the federal budget process got so dysfunctional that the fiscal year had to
                    be shifted so that it started October 1 rather than July 1.</p>
                <p>This Program Office staff consisted of Jim Anderson, Terry Liercke, Tom Tyler
                    (who left the Agency shortly afterwards), Doug Broom and me. Each of the other
                    four was responsible for a sector of the Nigeria program. The slow release of
                    our approved budget in “dribs and drabs” forced us to a develop a method of
                    gauging right down to a gnat's eyelash what the operational funding requirements
                    of these projects were. This enabled us to allocate the scarce available funds
                    to those projects according to operational need. And, though forward funding for
                    some projects fell to about six weeks before we were able to add funds, we
                    managed to keep these programs going as agreed based on the revised project
                    plans. But it was quite labor-intensive and a bit nerve-wracking because funding
                    of some contracts occasionally risked falling beneath the amount needed for
                    demobilization, if it had come to that. Keeping this crazy process on track made
                    us a bit “demanding” in our relations with the Controller's Office, the
                    technical divisions, the institutional contractors and even the front office of
                    the Mission (whose approvals and signatures we frequently needed). Obviously the
                    contractors felt that they were being poorly treated.Suffice it to say that our
                    efforts weren't universally appreciated.</p>
                <p>Nigeria is a fascinating country. I hate the way the word “dynamic” is bandied
                    around, but that word really applies to Nigeria. More than any African country I
                    know, it is a cauldron, and history is conjuring with it. I think, like India
                    and Brazil, it will have ups and downperhaps more dramatic ones than either of
                    those two countriebut will begin to cohere in the next decade or two into a
                    strong economic and political force in Africa and, eventually, beyond.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>I really think that AID did a lot of good there. We laid important foundations
                    for future development through our investments in institution building. These
                    investments were made in the form of technical assistance and training under
                    contracts with Michigan State University for the University of Nigeria in
                    agriculture, with Wisconsin for the University of Ife in agriculture, New York
                    University for Lagos University in public administration, Kansas State
                    University for Ahmadu Bello University in agriculture and veterinary medicine,
                    and with Ohio State and Wisconsin in the education sector in the north. That's
                    only a partial list. There were other contracts in the education, agriculture
                    extension and agricultural research sectors that I can't recall
                    specifically.</p>
                <p>As a result of these long-running projects thousands of people received training
                    and hundreds were groomed through academic and on-the-job mentoring for leading
                    roles in the targeted institutions, each with a key role in the development
                    process.</p>
                <p>And — I would love to research this — I believe that, if we looked at the
                    development of the other Nigerian universities that occurred during the
                    seventies and eighties (as the number of States in Nigeria grew from four to
                    around twenty and, later, to forty odd), we would find that a lot of the
                    Nigerian leaders in that process were people who gained training and experience
                    under the earlier generation of AID institutional development projects that were
                    focused on the smaller number of pioneering institutions.</p>
                <p>The Nigerians can really be very difficult people to work with because they are
                    strong minded, energetic, tough and tenacious — whether they are in the right or
                    the wrong. But you know, I think we at times sold them short. For instance - we
                    talked about the bitterness between the Nigerian and American governments after
                    the civil war - one of the things that generated this bitterness was the
                    position taken by the U.S. and the international community concerning the
                    management of the relief and rehabilitation program for former Biafra. The
                    donors wanted to manage that program directly because they were convinced that
                    there would be a blood bath. But the Nigerians categorically refused. Their
                    position was, “These are our people, and we will care for them ourselves”.</p>
                <p>Finally, the US and the other donors backed down. And it turned out there were
                    decent and dedicated Nigerians to take on that task. A guy named Olusegun
                    Obasanjo, then a Brigadier General who commanded the Nigerian Army engineers,
                    was given the job of running the R and R Program as we called it.He ran it very
                    well. I never heard a word of criticism of his performance in that role. There
                    was certainly no blood bath. It drives me nuts that positive news seldom gets
                    out through the media. Our diplomatic reporting and internal discourse are
                    regrettably not free of a tendency to depict whole populations as caricatures of
                    the extreme types among them. And those perceptions sometimes influence our
                    policy and decision-making.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you deal with Brigadier Obasanjo?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, but not substantively. I met him about twice. I can't say that we
                    ever got to know one another. He frequently visited USAID Mission offices in the
                    Mother Cat building (the name given it by the Yoruba landlord), but dealt mainly
                    with the R and R staff and the front office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then we had a rehabilitation program going on at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe it continued for most of my time in Nigeria. The office that
                    ran the R and R program, comprising around ten professionals was, I believe, the
                    largest substantive staff unit in what was surely the biggest USAID mission in
                    Africa at that time. As I recall it, they were engaged in running a program of
                    grants to various NGOs, including a food aid program. I think it also involved
                    operating something like a Commodity Import Program. There was a supply
                    management group that was mostly engaged in supporting the R and R program. But
                    the Nigerian Army was certainly responsible for the overall administrative
                    framework and much of the hands-on effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any idea what the scale of our rehabilitation program was,
                        how much money are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No exact idea, but it was significant. I think our pre-replanning
                    technical assistance budget was 19 million dollars, which still seemed pretty
                    substantial in those days in the Africa context. I think the total R and R
                    program, including food aid, was more than that.</p>
                <p>A propos the fear of a blood bath, I remember being struck by the fact that
                    almost all of my contacts in the Nigerian government were Ibos who had been in
                    Biafra during the war. And the other thing I remember is that they weren't
                    particularly thankful to be reemployed. They seemed to take it for granted. And
                    one of them expressed to me a grievance that he said was shared by his
                    confreres. It was that they hadn't been promoted with their age group peers
                    while they were serving the Biafran cause. And so, in terms of grade and salary,
                    they were a few years behind their colleagues who had entered the federal civil
                    service when they did. I personally had a hard time sympathizing with them on
                    that issue. It certainly wasn't a blood bath.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They came back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. And half of the drivers in the USAID motor pool were Ibos who had
                    come back. As far as I can tell, they and other Ibos who returned to higher
                    positions in the administrative and general services area were all reabsorbed in
                    many of their prewar functions very quickly. As I recall the dispatcher and
                    assistant dispatcher were Ibos. I never noticed any particular tension between
                    the Ibo and non-Ibo drivers.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I couldn't observe the real relations between them. My
                    impression is that West Africans are very preoccupied with peaceful relations
                    between individuals and groups. On the whole, they are considerably more polite
                    than we Americans and Westerners as a group. The politeness serves an important
                    social purpose. Few West Africans live in areas that are not multiethnic in some
                    important degree. And even within their own ethnic groupings, there are all
                    manner of subgroup, including caste, distinctions. I'm convinced their
                    regrettable inability or unwillingness to hold one another accountable is
                    probably related to the extreme care they normally take not to crowd one
                    another. The question “why?” when it is asked of an individual concerning his or
                    her acts, seldom elicits a useful response. When asked by an African it is
                    generally a rhetorical expression of frustration, and no response is
                    expected.</p>
                <p>One of the most fascinating people I met in Nigeria was a man named Clement
                    Onyamalukwe who was married to an American girl and, knowing him, probably still
                    is. During the war he was in charge of civil aviation in Biafra, particularly
                    the airport that was so central to the relief effort. And, as I recall, he held
                    an important federal post in civil aviation after the war. But he was the guy
                    who managed to keep that airport open so all those planes could get in and
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The relief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. I forget the name of the airport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uli Airstrip.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, something like that. And there were a lot of pretty wild stories
                    about how they did things on the Biafran side during the Civil War. And I would
                    think that quite a few books would have been written about that. But I haven't
                    noticed any. The Biafrans were doing technologically ingenious things such as
                    running vehicles on coal and steam, let's say. I've only heard sketchy
                    references to the things they did. Come to think of it, I believe Clement
                    Onyamalukwe told me that he or others would be writing a book.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed being in the country even though in some ways it was one of my least
                    happy office working situations.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: A lot of the projects were phased out. I don't remember if any actually
                    had closed down before I left during the summer of 1973.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No. I don't think the University of Nigeria resumed functioning during
                    my time there. This is something that I would want to be cautious about, but I
                    think it was because, to the Nigerians, that University symbolized the seeds of
                    the civil war. They saw it as a hotbed of Ibo nationalism and chauvinism and,
                    worse in their eyes, as the devils workshop in which remarkable technical
                    capacities had been added to the Ibos enterprising, can-do attitude. I'm pretty
                    sure that people, like Carl Eicher, who were instrumental in the development of
                    the University through the AID program, could not get visas to visit Nigeria for
                    a long time after the civil war. They were on a black list. They were somehow
                    all tarred with the Biafra brush.</p>
                <p>I visited “soon-to-be” Biafra during a TDY during March and April of 1966. Later,
                    apart from my official travel, our family traveled around much of Nigeria by
                    road. We visited the Western Region, the Midwest, the Middle Belt and the main
                    cities of Northern Nigeria, but I never got back to the Eastern Region. I had no
                    official reason to go there because the R and R program was all we had there,
                    and it was exempt from the concerns that caused us to replan the technical
                    assistance program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anything else on that? You can add it later but I
                        think you have given a good picture of the situation there. Anything more
                        about these institutional development projects in terms of their impact or
                        their function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, you know, when I evaluated our institutional development projects,
                    we didn't go into the question of impact in terms of, say, the numbers trained
                    by the beneficiary institutions or the subsequent contributions of those who had
                    received the training. We didn't have the time for that, nor was AID/W open to
                    rethinking the retrenchment that they had already decided upon. And we didn't
                    have the time or resources to assess the quality of the training they provided.
                    We mainly assessed (a) the degree to which institutional goals were being met
                    and (b) the types and amounts of additional assistance that would be needed for
                    the achievement of the most essential goals (particularly institutional
                    viability) to be either attained or within reach when U.S. project assistance
                    ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the whole, were the institutions pretty well
                        established and staffed by Nigerians at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I would say so. Our advisory teams were chiefly covering leadership
                    positions while the Nigerians slated to fill these roles permanently were either
                    still in training in the U.S. In a few cases the top Nigerians had returned and
                    were receiving on the job mentoring from senior Americans. We considered that
                    phase out should not occur until the leadership positions within faculties and
                    departments were filled by people who had completed their academic training and
                    had functioned in those jobs for one or two years while being coached in their
                    new roles by the often-quite-distinguished advisors who led these AID-financed
                    university contract teams. Our first idea was that there should also be a
                    plausible alternative Nigerian candidate for each senior Nigerian position, but
                    I think this target had to be sacrificed later for budgetary and timing
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>Since we have been discussing some of the evaluation work we did while I was
                    there, I want to complete that discussion before we go on to other matters. The
                    Amadu Bello University Faculty of Veterinary Medicine evaluation didn't turn out
                    to be as valuable as I would have wished. Veterinary education posed issues that
                    were quite distinct from those surrounding the agriculture faculties at ABU and
                    the University of Ife. Also, the USAID Food and Agriculture Division had no
                    veterinary medicine education expert on its staff. So we agreed when KSU
                    requested that a Professor of Veterinary Medicine participate in that
                    evaluation. The KSU Chief of Party and the USAID division chief nominated the
                    individual we selected. I'll not mention the Professor's name, but as soon as he
                    hit the ground it was clear that he was an old friend and colleague of the Chief
                    of Party and that he had no intention whatsoever of operating according to the
                    new USAID evaluation precepts or of being collaborative. My experience with this
                    guy was an eye-opener. It was my first and most dramatic encounter with what I
                    came to call a “fraternal evaluation”. The draft report made no pretense of
                    objectivity. It was essentially a polemic on why we should go along with
                    everything KSU wanted to do plus some expensive and time-consuming things that
                    they hadn't even thought of. We obviously didn't implement the recommendations.
                    It was the operational equivalent of kicking over the card table and shooting
                    out the lights. By this time the demand for systematic evaluations was abating,
                    and I couldn't prevent the resulting report from being a muddle. We wound up
                    planning project assistance to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine much less
                    rationally than in the preceding cases. As I recall, we “split the difference”
                    between what KSU wanted, as reflected in the fraternal evaluation, and what
                    others and I thought made sense based on the kind of analysis that we normally
                    used. It was a lesson for me.</p>

                <p>Granted a six months sabbatical to complete doctoral thesis - 1973</p>
                <p>GILBERT: 1973, in the summer. And I went back to Ghana for two weeks thinking I
                    would pick up documents and information pertaining to my Ph.D. thesis topic. I
                    can't remember exactly what I planned to pursue at that point, but I quickly
                    discovered that a number of people who had been in Accra during my time had
                    chosen topics that overlapped with mine. I didn't have time to reformulate my
                    plan, so I wound up just getting every set of semi-relevant-seeming statistics
                    and documentation that I could acquire or photo copy before heading back to the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>I had been awarded a six-month assignment to a brand new training program that
                    permitted one to pursue independent studies, research and/or writing on subjects
                    approved by AID. I requested and was allowed to go to the Fletcher School. I
                    arrived there in early September and got my reformulated thesis proposal
                    approved just before Thanksgiving. I really worked flat out and turned my back
                    on all the distractions and temptations (being lionized or patronized as the
                    representative of the field practitioners to groves of academe was something
                    that absorbed much of the time and attention of many mid-career trainees. There
                    is a considerable appetite among academics for practitioners' input to their
                    classes and to have their research and ideas vindicated by them.). But it was
                    clear that six months wouldn't be sufficient, so I applied for and was granted
                    90 days' leave of absence. With that amount of time I was able to “break the
                    back” of my thesis. After returning to work, I worked on it one day per weekend
                    and then took all of August 1975 off to work on it in the State Department
                    library. I was able to submit a complete draft by early spring of 1976. About
                    when I began 14 weeks of one-on-one French training in early summer of 1976, I
                    received the draft text back with the comments of my readers (Rob West and Dirk
                    Strycker). So I took French for six hours a day and worked evenings on revising
                    my thesis with the invaluable assistance of my typist and editor, Susan Mudge
                    (one of the most efficient, organized, conscientious and kind people I ever
                    met). I also sold one investment property and bought two others during this
                    period. By the time I left for Yaounde, I had reached the 2 plus level in
                    French, successfully defended my thesis and acquired borderline high blood
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>Even though I asked for and was granted the 90-day leave of absence, AID didn't
                    stop my salary. I was so busy I didn't have time to call around trying to get
                    people to remedy this oversight. I was really in a crisis mode trying to make
                    the most of the available time. Later on it took me a couple of years to get
                    anybody to deal with the fact that I had been paid while on leave without pay.
                    Apart from trying to be the guy my mother thought I was, I knew that sooner or
                    later it would come to light and, when that happened, I would be treated like a
                    crook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had to pay it all back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well I finally “got” to pay it back. And when “they” finally focused on
                    the situation, they at first wanted me to make a lumpsum payment of a fourth of
                    a year's salary. I could have afforded that when I was newly returned to the
                    U.S. in the fall of 1973, but after three years in the U.S. I would have had to
                    refinance a house to come up with that kind of money. And there was no way to do
                    that from Cameroon, where I was by then. They finally agreed, somewhat huffily,
                    to deduct it from my salary over a period of several years.</p>
                <p>While we're on the subject of the personnel administration “system”, I'll tell
                    you something that happened during the period when I was in Ghana. During the
                    60s and 70s lots of people were assigned to Vietnam. Families couldn't accompany
                    employees there and had to reside instead in the U.S. or at overseas “safe
                    haven” posts (Bangkok and Manila are the two that I recall). Because of the
                    allowances, Vietnam duty offered significant financial rewards. Therefore,
                    Vietnam assignments were a boon for single employees or those who could easily
                    tolerate or even wanted a separation from their spouses. There were enough
                    volunteers for a while, but the fighting escalated, U.S. involvement deepened
                    and the U.S. “hearts and minds” programs began to mushroom after 1965.
                    Increasingly people were assigned on a nonvoluntary or “directed” basis.</p>
                <p>I had been in Accra for only about a year, when I received word that I was
                    assigned to Vietnam. I was upset. I had a young family, and I didn't want a
                    vacation from them. I was distinctly wary of the potential effects of the
                    inevitable strains on family relations that would result from the prolonged
                    separations that such an assignment would entail. Also, though I wasn't at all a
                    “dove”, I felt after 1965 that we were embarked on ill-advised and hopeless
                    enterprise in Vietnam. I intended to leave AID rather than go to Vietnam, and
                    said as much. Charlie Lindbeck was in charge of such things in the Africa Bureau
                    at that time, and he managed to get me “deferred.” He told Central Personnel
                    that I would exercise my civil service reemployment rights rather than go to
                    Vietnam. Fortunately, Central Personnel apparently didn't notice that I had no
                    civil service reemployment rights. (Laughs) I didn't have them because I had
                    converted to Foreign Service (Reserve) status less than 36 months after entering
                    on duty. I shouldn't be scornful of Central Personnel because they are usually
                    quite good at making sure that the rules get followed in such cases. They may
                    have been a party to Charlie's gambit. Whichever it was, I am very grateful to
                    never have served in Vietnam.But “I digress...”</p>
                <p>Two assignments to the Sahel Development Program office in USAID Washington -
                    1974-1976 and 1981-1983</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>GILBERT: So then, after that year at Fletcher, I came back to the Africa Bureau
                    and I went to work for David Shear in the office responsible for the nascent
                    Sahel program. I think it was called Central and West Africa Regional or
                    AFR/CWR. During the first several months, Sam Ray and I pulled together a budget
                    submission for all elements of that program. This was during the summer and fall
                    of 1974. By that time assessment teams fielded by MIT, Purdue and others
                    (including a group led by Ed Fei, later the PPC Regional Coordinator for Africa)
                    had gone out to the Sahel and prepared reports that contained drought recovery
                    as well as medium and long-term development program recommendations. As a
                    result, we were flooded with project ideas that needed to be sorted through and,
                    if preliminarily accepted, further documented for full review, approval and
                    implementation. And most of these “interventions” (I first heard that expression
                    during this time) were being lobbied for by various technical or institutional
                    interest groups. Given that at least three different studies had been prepared,
                    proposed interventions often existed in several configurations or formed parts
                    of different larger projects or program frameworks. This was prior to the
                    improvements to the project development and approval procedures that came to be
                    reflected in Handbook 3. The procedures in place at that time were not so
                    clearly specified, and, worse, there was little discipline in their
                    application.</p>
                <p>So, as a first step, Sam and I simply catalogued all these ideas in an
                    approximation of the annual budget submission format of that perioI think its
                    acronym was “CAP”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the precursor to the Sahel Development Program
                        (SDP)?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, in a pretty preliminary way. Some of the activities were for
                    straight relief and others were for short-term rehabilitation. Another important
                    group was called something like “medium-term program ideas” that had come out of
                    some of the various studies. There were also a number of regional projects that
                    predated the Sahel drought. We briefly considered triaging them, but abandoned
                    the idea because there were so many items and we were both newcomers. If we had
                    undertaken that, the resulting controversy would have prevented us from
                    organizing and categorizing the various options, and that was the essential
                    first step. And I think it took us at least until Christmas time to complete
                    that task. And when the thing was complete it was about as thick as a phone
                    book, although on heavier paper. As I recall, that product fed into a delayed,
                    ad hoc annual budget review process. That, in turn, fed into the Congressional
                    Presentation process and so forth. And by these steps, what became the Sahel
                    Regional Program began to emerge in semi-conventional AID documentation.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Before that process endeprobably in the early fall of 1974, I was appointed
                    Officer-in-Charge (OIC) for the Entente States. The Entente comprises Ivory
                    Coast, Togo, Benin (then Dahomey), Burkina Faso (then Upper Volta) and Niger. My
                    three colleagues and I handled three broad categories of programs. For the Sahel
                    countries there were relief and rehabilitation cum PL 480 emergency food aid
                    interventions to deal with the impact of the drought and its aftermath. The
                    second category was the nascent Sahel development program. It mainly consisted
                    then of two or three medium-term project ideas that were in preparation for each
                    Sahelian country plus a larger number of proposals for support to regional
                    institutions or networks. The third category consisted of the preexisting
                    regional program for the West and Central Africa Region augmented by new Entente
                    regional projects under the sponsorship and coordination of the Council of the
                    Entente.</p>
                <p>The Entente was a regional structure for cooperation on various economic fronts
                    among the member countries. Some of the cooperation was of an operational nature
                    involving trade and customs arrangements. It also sponsored and operated
                    regional development projects. These typically consisted of sub-projects with a
                    common thematic focus on national needs. None that I can recall was focused on a
                    transnational need that required a regional response. The Entente was also
                    something of a patronage mechanism. The big patron was France; the intermediate
                    patron was the Ivory Coast. For France and Ivory Coast it was an exercise in
                    something like nation building, but on a regional scale. Ivory Coast President
                    Houphouet-Boigny had a legitimate position as the doyen of the national leaders
                    within the region. He was also, I believe, the most dependable partner of France
                    within that grouping. Before independence he, like Leopold Senghor of Senegal,
                    had served in several postwar French cabinets.</p>
                <p>Active cooperation between France and the U.S. a rare, if not precious, flowewas
                    central to the nascent Sahel Program. And, in retrospect, working with the
                    Frencwho had lots of skilled, knowledgeable and dedicated African-oriented
                    expertwas one of the real pleasures of working on the Sahel Program, when things
                    were working well. During that period things mostly worked quite well.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>So, for the above - and perhaps othereasons, the Entente was a mechanism that our
                    elders and betters felt should be supported, and I didn't disagree. We operated
                    a number of regional programs. One had to do with African enterprise
                    development. Another focused on the livestock sector. Both had loan and grant
                    components with the grants going to the poorer countries and the loans going to
                    Ivory Coast, Togo and Dahomey. A small international, entirely non-African,
                    Entente Council technical staff managed these activities. Paul Kaya, the
                    executive secretary, was from Congo-Brazzaville. He insisted on keeping member
                    country nationals off the staff. He knew that, otherwise, the inevitable
                    pressures to balance such appointments would lead either to overstaffing or
                    tensions over the composition of a small staff. The staff consisted of an
                    American, Robert Mingus, and two Frenchmen.). I believe these regional projects
                    were also funded by France and, just possibly, by other donorsuch as Canada - as
                    well. Largely due to legal definitions and accounting issues that arose from the
                    multi-donor and regional character of these projects, the processes for
                    designing, reviewing and approving them infallibly became marvels of complexity.
                    Each project was designed in terms of thematics and criteria that would govern
                    the selection of sub-projects in each country. Once the projects were approved,
                    the Entente staff worked with national staffs to identify, analyze and document
                    sub-projects that had to be approved by the U.S. and other donors as well as by
                    the Council of the Entente. This process consumed an amazing amount of Africa
                    Bureau staff time and energy. The pressure to resolve all issues in favor of
                    moving forward was greater than usual for these projects because the Entente
                    regional program provided an avenue for providing assistance to Ivory Coast,
                    which could not qualify for bilateral assistance due to its high per capita
                    income, for responding to needs in Togo and Benin which had no significant
                    bilateral programs due to their small size, and for cooperation with the
                    French.</p>
                <p>The medium-term projects that were coming on stream for Burkina Faso and Niger
                    also absorbed an awful lot of energy due to the issues they raised and the lack
                    of consensus, for a time at least, as to how they should be documented, approved
                    and funded. So between the complexities of the Entente Regional and Sahel
                    medium-term projects on one hand and the volume and urgency of the emergency and
                    R and R needs on the other, the Entente Desk's staff of four was really
                    unmercifully overworked.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's pause a minute. So, you were working on the Sahel

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: For two years: from the summer of 1974 to the summer of 1976.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I sure was. And it was tumultuous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to do? What was the point of all this
                        activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I'll tell you one thing. Some of us had precious little time to stop and
                    reflect on what the point of it was. And I'm sure my comment on that would
                    resonate with some feelings of outside critics also. But, the answer to that
                    question has several layers.</p>
                <p>One, of course, was that there had been this tremendous drought and, as a result,
                    a humanitarian emergency in the Sahel. Task number one was to address the
                    immediate threats to lives and livelihoods arising from that catastrophe. And a
                    lot of food aid and related emergency relief resources were flowing into the
                    Sahel even after I arrived in the summer of 1974. This need and the related
                    workload would remain the principal focus of our energies for the next year or
                    two. But there was also a shared view among the leadership of the Africa Bureau,
                    and to some extent beyond it, that droughts were a recurring phenomenon in the
                    Sahel and that the region's ability to cope with future occurrences could be
                    greatly enhanced through pursuit of a bold and imaginative development strategy.
                    The resulting investment program, though probably expensive, would likely prove
                    less so than responding every ten or so years to recurring drought emergencies.
                    Without such action, the Sahel's ability to cope with each successive drought
                    would decline due population increase.</p>
                <p>The countries of the West and Central African Sahel were all francophone and had
                    previously received little assistance, apart from the substantial amounts
                    provided by France. But these countries' needs were so great and their own
                    capacities so weak that most French aid went to cover government operations.
                    Although there was some variation from country to country (Senegal, Mali and
                    Burkina Faso each had considerably more administrative, technical and financial
                    capacity than Mauritania, Niger and Chad), the French typically remained closely
                    involvepolitically, operationally and financially - in the conduct of the
                    essential business of these governments. The French presence in the private
                    sector was even more pervasive. I remember observing a vivid example of this in
                    Cote d'Ivoire. Sometime in the late sixties I was sitting between flights in the
                    bar at the Abidjan airport when two overall-wearing Frenchmen carried in a
                    barstool, which they installed in place of a defective one. I also remember
                    seeing Frenchmen manning the meat section of a super market in Abidjan in 1969.
                    (Once, in about 1976 in Gabon, I saw Yugoslavs doing manual labor on road
                    construction; our embassy told me that it was impossible to hire Gabonese to do
                    such work.)</p>
                <p>AID provided very little assistance to the former French colonies in Africa. That
                    little was provided in the form of regional projects, largely designed to
                    strengthen regional institutions and further a regional approach to development.
                    Though I was never involved in any deliberations on the subject, I believe AID's
                    stance reflected a consensus that the countries of the region were not
                    potentially viable and that they effectively remained colonies of France. The
                    French were wary of our substantive involvement in these countries. It wasn't in
                    our nature to take a hands-off approach. These countries were understood within
                    AID and State to be French turf (the French expression is “chasse reserv�e” or
                    hunting reserve) and not our problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Though I was still in Nigeria when the U.S. was coming to grips with the extent
                    of the Sahel drought and its implications, I'm pretty sure that the initial
                    reaction was to wonder what the French planned to do about it. No doubt, it was
                    a rude shock when the media coverage and the resulting public reaction made it
                    impossible to leave the needed response to the French and their European
                    partners. I doubt that CNN was in operation in the early 1970s and the media
                    certainly brought vivid images of human suffering to the attention of the
                    American public during the Nigerian civil war, but the Sahel drought was
                    definitely one stage in the development of what has come to be called the “CNN
                    effect.”</p>
                <p>I give this background because it helps to put in perspective the significance of
                    the change that the legislative mandating of substantial funding for a special
                    Sahel regional development program represented when it was launched in the
                    mid-1970s. The leaders who pushed it through were, as I recall, the Assistant
                    Administrator for Africa, Dr. Samuel Adams, his Deputy, Don Brown, the Director
                    of REDSO/WCA in Abidjan and then AFR/CWR in Washington, David Shear, and the
                    Director of the Africa Bureau Technical Resources Office, Princeton Lyman.
                    Earlier Dr. Adams and Don Brown had relied on the previous leadership of AFR/CWR
                    - Director Fermino Spencer, Deputy Director Owen Cylke and Assistant Director
                    for Program Hariadene Johnson - in pursuing these same goals. However, this
                    group did not command the staff resources or exercise the degree of discretion
                    in the application of project selection criteria and AID procedures that the
                    Shear team enjoyed.</p>
                <p>The concept that Congress accepted and wrote into AID's legislation had both
                    programmatic and institutional aspects. The programmatic content was based on
                    the assumption that the Sahel could achieve food security and the ability to
                    withstand future recurrence of droughts if sufficient investment were made in
                    the development of the rain-fed and irrigated agricultural and livestock
                    production potentials of the region. With four river basins (Senegal, Gambia,
                    Volta, and Niger) and the Lake Chad basin located in the Sahel it seemed more or
                    less obvious that there was a large irrigation potential that, if developed,
                    could give the region an agricultural surplus in normal years and, thus, the
                    resilience to withstand the droughts that would recur cyclically. This was to be
                    a regional program consisting of national/bilateral and transnational
                    components. Together they would form a coherent regional effort to address the
                    highest priority development needs of the Sahel.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The main need was for enhanced food security and, with it, the capacity to
                    withstand the effects of future droughts. This concept was formulated without
                    much attention to economiparticularly, marketing - issues. I don't recall that
                    there was any discussion of how rain-fed subsistence farmers, once rendered
                    destitute by the next drought, would benefit from the irrigated sector's greater
                    ability to maintain production. It was understood that population growth, which
                    caused cultivation to extend inexorably onto increasingly marginal lands in
                    competition with livestock grazing, would have to be slowed somehow. But primary
                    health care coverage was so abysmal that it was obvious that improving it was to
                    be the first order of business.</p>
                <p>The Sahel governments seemed never to officially think or talk about markets
                    except to decry the rise of agricultural prices above some “fair level” due to
                    the evil machinations of middlemen. Their idea of fair was based on some rough
                    calculation of the cost of production and took little account of the farmers
                    needs or of the middleman's costs for transport, storage or of the need for
                    middlemen to make a profit as an incentive to stay in a risky business. If one
                    questioned this stance, the reaction of the Sahelian side would range somewhere
                    between stony, studied non-comprehension to incredulity and huffiness. In those
                    dayafter AID had effectively purged its economic staf- one got little support
                    within AID for raising economic policy issues. One was left with the feeling
                    that it was “undiplomatic” to broach such questions. And, in a sense, maybe it
                    was undiplomatic to raise questions that neither side had the resources to treat
                    in much depth. As a person with some economics training and understanding, I was
                    certainly not alone in AID at that time. But, as overworked operators, few of us
                    had the time to gather and analyze the necessary data.Each of our projects were
                    subjected to economic analysis and passed muster without gross fiddling. Since
                    there was very little data, the outcomes of project economic analyses were quite
                    sensitive to the methodology employed and the assumptions used. That probably
                    didn't hurt the chances of favorable outcomes.</p>
                <p>What we didn't and couldn't do at the outset was rigorously analyze the
                    macroeconomic and sector economic policy and institutional issues bearing on our
                    broad programmatic concept. Unless we were content to defer active engagement in
                    Sahel development for years, we had to proceed with a measure of faith that we
                    could begin our engagement in the Sahel by addressing the most obvious problems
                    and constraints which, as such, seemed not particularly sensitive to broaas yet
                    not fully understood or articulateeconomic, policy and institutional issues.
                    Later on we would better understand and, therefore, be able to address economic
                    policy and institutional issues.</p>
                <p>Although I'm not sure I ever heard it stated explicitly, I believe all of us were
                    driven by a conviction that we were operating within a smallish window of
                    opportunity opened by the vivid experience of the Sahel drought. We needed to
                    capitalize on a fleeting receptivity of the executive and legislative branches
                    of the U.S. government and within the international community to create and
                    impart momentum to a substantial Sahel regional development program. That window
                    would close as the Sahel drought receded from recent memory.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The other part of the concept was to work in partnership with the Sahelians and
                    our donor partners through two new organizations. The Sahelian governments had
                    organized themselves into a body called the CILSS (the French acronym for
                    Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel) in 1972 or thereabouts as
                    they were beginning to appreciate the implications of the 1972-74 crisis. The
                    CILSS had a Secretariat in Ouagadougou. In response, the donorbut particularly
                    the French, the Canadians and the Umoved to respond by setting up a counterpart
                    donor grouping called the Friends of the Sahel Club (Club des Amis du Sahel,
                    mostly referred to as simply the “Club”) with a Secretariat hosted by the OECD
                    in Paris. This arrangement began to take shape on an informal basis beginning
                    around 1974. I believe 1976 was the year when it was formalized.</p>
                <p>So, from one perspective, we were just plunging ahead without an adequate
                    analytical framework. But from another perspective (and, I think, the correct
                    one), we were moving deliberately to build such a framework on a collaborative
                    basis. Working with the CILSS, the U.S. and other donors set up various
                    Club-CILSS working groups or study committees (they were called “Groupes du
                    Travail” and “Comit�s de R�flexion” in French) whose membership was made up of
                    Sahelian and donor experts. These were typically focused on sectoral and
                    functional issues. One was concerned with “Marketing Price Policy and Storage”.
                    I can't remember the specifics, but others had to do with livestock and range
                    management, river basin development, transportation, water resource management,
                    etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Initially these bodies were preoccupied with the Sahelians' desire to set
                    programs in operation and get resources flowing, but gradually their focus
                    shifted to more policy-related issues. Thanks to donor initiatives a number of
                    studies related to sectoral economic, and particularly marketing, constraints
                    and issues were launched. They grew in number and began to produce findings that
                    generated new perceptions on the part of both donors and Sahelians. One early
                    study, carried out in the late 1970s by Elliot Berg, was entitled “Reforming
                    Grain Marketing Systems in West Africa” under a contract with the Center for
                    Research on Economic Development (CRED) at the University of Michigan. Another
                    two were also carried out by CRED. One was called the “Red Meat Study” (probably
                    not its formal title). The other was on “Livestock Production and Marketing in
                    the Entente States.” These are only a few examples of a considerably larger
                    number of such studies. The earliest studies were typically launched to follow
                    up on issues raised in project identification studies and design exercises or
                    encountered in the course of project implementation. It was not unusual for
                    consideration of highly focused studies to stimulate spinoff studies of broader
                    or more fundamental issues. And, as the Sahelians could see that projects were
                    actually starting up, their tolerance for and even interest in such studies
                    gradually grew. At our level, my staff and I had little time for anything except
                    operations related to drought relief and recovery and to getting medium-term
                    projects ready for approval and, once approved, under implementation. But we
                    were also cogs in a bigger wheel. The CWR management structure consisted of Dave
                    Shear and Irv Coker, respectively the Director and Deputy Director, and two
                    Assistant Directors: one, Irv Rosenthal, for Program (i.e., Development Program)
                    and another, Jim Kelly, for Relief and Rehabilitation. Each of the Assistant
                    Directors had a small staff. Hal Gray and Cleta Capoferri worked on Program
                    matters. Herb Miller worked on R and R as a member of my team but in close
                    coordination with Kelly.</p>
                <p>When tapped for the Directorship of AFR/CWR, David Shear negotiated for and
                    apparently received the closest thing I ever saw to carte blanche authority to
                    make decisions. The funds set aside for medium-term projects were part of a
                    specia(”notwithstanding any other provisions ...”) appropriation and/or
                    set-aside of emergency funds for Sahel relief and rehabilitation. They couldn't
                    be used outside the Sahel. David considered that he had the authority to approve
                    all uses of these funds whether for projects or contracts with universities
                    chosen non-competitively based on waivers that I believe he approved himself.
                    This made for a very fast moving and free wheeling organization.</p>
                <p>David, by the way, committed himself and us to follow Agency rules and procedures
                    to the extent practicable. We mostly did so and I don't think the quality of our
                    work compared unfavorably with AID's normal work. The main difference was that
                    when we didn't have all the information that was desirable, we were atypically
                    relentless in using the available information to figure out a basis for moving
                    forward, if necessary on a limited basis or timeframe. Most of our mistakeand we
                    certainly made some - should have been easy to correct based on good monitoring
                    and evaluation during implementation. What we didn't foresee was that it would
                    take years before implementation and evaluation in the field could measure up to
                    normal AID standards (which were also just getting reestablished after a period
                    of revision).</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>David was — and, no doubt, remains — both a visionary and a breathtakingly
                    energetic, decisive and creative dealmaker. From my perspective it appeared that
                    David Shear operated in close coordination with the policy level officers of AID
                    and State and in frequent dialogue with staff and principals on the Hill and in
                    the Bureau of the Budget, in U.N. organizations and at the senior levels of a
                    variety of donor organizations. He also conducted an active diplomacy vis-�-vis
                    various universitiechiefly, Michigan (CRED), Michigan State (the Agricultural
                    Economics Department and Purdue. Each received contracts (or, maybe, grants) for
                    various studies of which some were a bit loosely defined so they could respond
                    to unforeseen needs. The part of his modus operandi that was most visible to me
                    was his descent from the “mountains” every few days to spin off news of the
                    latest developments and give follow up instructions.</p>
                <p>Follow up could consist of funds to be allocated or allotted, projects to be
                    developed, contract scopes-of-works to be developed or modified, waivers of
                    competitive selection or U.S. procurement, briefing papers, cables, etc. to be
                    prepared. We were the “his people” who called “their people” after deals were
                    struck. The initial brunt of this fell on the two Irvs (Coker and Rosenthal),
                    but I was brought in on these sessions fairly often. Every so often I went along
                    in sort of a handler capacity on the various mountaineering expeditions. It was
                    exhilarating, but it was also daunting. For me, at least, it was impossible, as
                    I sat there reveling in the Olympian grandeur of the thing, not also to be
                    mentally sorting through the workload implications and trying to keep my
                    composure. One great source of satisfaction was that if one did a reasonable job
                    of acting on the follow up instructions, one's work was rapidly cleared by “the
                    Irvs” and signed off on by David (if Ivana Trump had been a media personality
                    back then, we might have called him “The David”).</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>But as the months stretched into years, the daunting aspect increasingly
                    predominated. We all burned out at different rates. I think, though, that some
                    of us became mesmerized enough to have difficulty recognizing it. This was a
                    period when I spent part of each weekend plus one whole month of vacation time
                    polishing off my dissertation. I think I acquitted myself honorably until the
                    end, but as my two-year anniversary approached I definitely felt ready for my
                    somewhat tattered soul to transmigrate to another incarnation, preferably
                    overseas. One of the things that detracted from the experience was the reaction
                    of the other offices to the dynamism of the Sahel program. One dimension of it
                    was sheer jealousy. No one had seen anything like it before in the Africa
                    Bureau, and I wonder if the Vietnam Desk (which was more like a bureau) matched
                    it for the pace of decision-making. I also noted that many begrudged the
                    resources that were flowing into the Sahel. Although they were special,
                    noncompetitive funds then, it wasn't hard to imagine that at some point in the
                    future funds earmarked for the Sahel would negatively influence the overall
                    availability of funds for the rest of Africa. When I was offered a job by
                    another geographic office in the summer of 1974 I remember its director strongly
                    cautioning me against going to the Sahel program, implying (while taking care
                    not say anything quotable) that Shear and his office were running wild and that
                    he and his people would become pariahs when the Sahel declined in priority.
                    Based on what I saw then and later, I have to say there was a lot of resentment
                    of David Shear as a person. I think the main reason was that he simply refused
                    to act like a bureaucrat. He took calculated risks with no observable
                    hesitation. He worked like killing snakes, and his example was followed by most
                    of his staff. I don't think I ever saw the like. He was a “curve-raiser”, and we
                    can all remember how that can be resented in a scholastic setting. I think some
                    saw him as something of a traitor to his class. Also, they couldn't believe that
                    he wasn't mainly trying to promote himself. (I discount that. David may not be a
                    particularly sensitive person, but he could certainly perceive that his task
                    could easily turn out to be a thankless. He had the talent to go far without the
                    unusual challenge of the Sahel program. Instead, I would say he was a driven
                    overachievepretty frightening in someone of his talent - who was motivated by a
                    desire to influence the course of history as much as anything else. I think he
                    would have been happy to be either Assistant Administrator for Africa or AID
                    Administrator provided either role were offered with an endorsement of his way
                    of doing business and an expectation that he would apply it on a wider scale.
                    The foregoing is my own reading. David and I never discussed his ambitions.)</p>
                <p>But none of this slowed us down much. The Africa Bureau and central bureau
                    technical and specialized staffs whose cooperation we needed partly believed in
                    what we were doing, partly shared in the exhilaration of seeing their work
                    rewarded by quicker-than-usual approval and implementation and partly knew that
                    if they didn't engage there would be repercussions. Neither David nor Princeton
                    Lyman, the Director of the Technical Resources Office, were reticent about
                    confronting non-collaboration and both could count on strong support from the
                    Africa Bureau and Agency front offices. We also had a technical staff within
                    CWR, which spotty though it was, reduced our need to call on the technical staff
                    of the Africa or central bureaus.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>No picture of these days could approach completeness without describing the field
                    staffing of the Sahel program. During the really early days preceding the
                    drought, field management of the very few regional projects depended on a
                    correspondingly light, Embassy-based staff structure. There were Regional
                    Development Officers in Dakar, Niamey (Sarah Jane Littlefield) and Yaounde (John
                    Koehring). When the drought took hold, Relief Officers (possibly not their exact
                    title) were assigned to the staff of embassies in non-RDO posts. Jim Kelly
                    served as Relief Officer in the early phases of the drought, but came to
                    Washington about when I did in the summer of 1974. Terry Lambacher was Relief
                    Officer in Niamey. I believe Jim Anderson worked on Mauritania relief but may
                    have been based in Senegal.</p>
                <p>During the early days of the drought, REDSO/WCA in Abidjan - with David Shear as
                    its Director and Roy Stacy as his key (but by no means sole) collaborator on
                    Sahel matters - played a key role. They played a key role in bringing Washington
                    to understand the severity and extent of the drought emergency. Then they laid
                    the intellectual foundations of what became formally known as the Sahel
                    Development Program (SDP) by analyzing and documenting the agro-climatic and
                    agro-ecological trends and issues pertaining to Sahelian development history and
                    prospects. David Shear had been brought in to head up the CWR Office in 1974.
                    Roy continued in Abidjan until 1975 or so when he went to Paris to join the
                    nascent Club du Sahel Secretariat headed by Anne de Lattre.</p>
                <p>It was not long after David's return to Washington in summer of 1974 that AID
                    began to build up a field management structure consisting of strengthened
                    Regional Development Offices (RDOs) and new Country Development Offices (CDOs).
                    At the beginning, each CDO had a loose relationship to an RDO, but this rapidly
                    lost practical meaning. The CDOs were placed in Ouagadougou and Ndjamena. For
                    the Western Sahel, I'm pretty sure that the RDO was in Dakar and the CDO was in
                    Bamako, but it might have been vice versa. In Niamey and Yaounde, the two
                    preexisting RDOs were beefed up. Before long we had as principal officers Norman
                    Schoonover in Dakar, Ron Levin in Bamako, John Hoskins in Ouagadougou, Al Baron
                    in Niamey, John Koehring in Cameroon (responsible for Chad) and, subsequently,
                    John Lundgren in Chad. And we gradually assigned additional professionals. These
                    were mostly program officers such as Gene Chiavaroli in Niamey and Glenn Slocum
                    in Yaounde. But they also received additional technical staff such as Jim
                    Livingston as Agriculture Officer in Niamey, a Range Management/Animal Husbandry
                    Officer named Dilley, Mike White as Health Officer in Dakar and Al Henn as
                    Health Officer in Yaounde, to name just a few. As these field units grew to
                    resemble small USAID Missions, they received delegations of authority.</p>
                <p>They also became parties to the development of the medium-term projects. I can't
                    remember the details, but from this point on bringing the design and
                    documentation of the medium-term projects to the point of readiness for approval
                    became a difficult, slow and painful process. I remember it this way: The field
                    offices were supposed to be at the center of the process because, if for no
                    other reason, they had to manage project implementation. It was also their
                    responsibility to work on this with their host governments.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>However, they were understaffed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Many of
                    the early field staff were French-speakers who had worked in the preexisting
                    regional structure or had been recruited from those coming out Vietnam as our
                    involvement there began to phase down. Some of them had good project development
                    and program management skills. Some, who did not, learned pretty quickly. But
                    too many of them were the types that the British damn with faint praise as being
                    “good in committee.” I take this to describe someone who is perhaps more
                    articulate than intelligent and not very able or much inclined to grapple
                    effectively with practical problems. Some of these people seemed to divide their
                    time between sweet-talking their host government counterparts into unrealistic
                    expectations and sending out shrill messages calling for others to do their
                    project development work and, either explicitly or implicitly, calling for
                    important technical and management concerns to be ignored. Interestingly, at the
                    same time, it was like pulling teeth to get these same people to make use of the
                    delegations of authority that Ed Dragon, Assistant GC for Africa and his
                    colleagues, had worked so hard to secure for them.</p>
                <p>But perhaps this unwillingness to “step up to the plate” and use the delegations
                    instead of playing “Mother may I?” or continually asking “Why do we have to
                    follow the rules?” or “Why can't we just make the Government and the Ambassador
                    happy by doing something that can't be justified on any other grounds?” is more
                    understandable than I would have conceded at the time. They were not full
                    Missions and the field leadership largely owed their positions to their
                    geographic office director, and that individual was an exceptionally strong
                    leader and decisive decision-maker. So granting them delegations of authority
                    (which were somewhat more circumscribed than those granted to directors of full
                    Missions) - viewed as a message that they should take more responsibility - was
                    in conflict with their circumstances and with other signals they were
                    receiving.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>Another group of Sahel field staff deserves mention. These were former Peace
                    Corps volunteers. They were picked up by AID at the end of their Peace Corps
                    stints. Some of them had married Sahelians and had families to support. Because
                    of their native intelligence, in-depth local knowledge, good connections,
                    dedication and eagerness to learn many of them rendered invaluable service. But,
                    inevitably, there were start up problems. Given that their newness was usually
                    combined with self-confidence and high energy, they required a degree of
                    supervision and mentoring that too often was not forthcoming from their
                    direct-hire “elders and betters.” I remember that we received a cable from Niger
                    in about 1974 reporting on some part of the country that had a particularly bad
                    harvest and concluded with the news that the Government of Niger, therefore,
                    “demanded” several thousand tons of food aid. Most of the people in the
                    geographic offices of AID and State realized, after a moment's reflection, that
                    the cable was in “Franglais” and that “demanded” should be understood as
                    “requested.” But most readers in the Food for Peace Office, PPC, Bureau of the
                    Budget and USDA probably needed an explanation. Many of the former PCVs who
                    worked for AID at this time went on to get postgraduate degrees and to have
                    successful careers in AID or in the consulting sector. Some of these folks whose
                    names come to mind are Louis Siegel of ARD, Laura McPherson who heads her own
                    firm, Charlie Stathacos of Abt, Tim Mooney of Abt and Steve Wisecarver, now
                    Director of REDSO/ESA.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in Washington, we were caught between the need to uphold AID standards
                    (as David Shear had pledged to do despite the discretion at his disposal) and to
                    move quickly (which was why we had been granted the flexibility). We couldn't do
                    both and too often we failed to accomplish either. And, due in part to the
                    previous pattern of AID's regional programs being run by staff attached to
                    Embassies, too many of the Ambassadors and even AID staff thought it was normal
                    for Ambassadors to be involved in the technical and managerial aspects of AID's
                    work.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, by the time I left in mid-1976, we had reached a point where there
                    were two-to-three medium-term projects in the early stages of implementation in
                    most of the Sahel countries. This outcome owed a great deal to Technical
                    Resources Office Director Princeton Lyman and members of his staff such as John
                    Pielemeier and Graham Thompson. The same must also be said of the REDSO/Abidjan
                    staff such as John Eriksen, Roger Poulin and, I believe, Martin Billings.</p>
                <p>Again, I'm not sure I correctly remember the details, but I believe that one
                    approach to the dilemma described above was to launch preliminary
                    implementation-cum-design phases of some of these projects. That was the
                    approach taken to the Eastern ORD (Organism Regional du Developpement) project
                    in Burkina Faso. MSU was given the responsibility for completing the design and
                    then implementing this project. David Wilcock was their team leader. Some of the
                    medium-term projects received their initial funding from the regular development

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: And so implementation of these medium-term projects and, thereby,
                    further development of analytical frameworks needed to support our programs got
                    underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of projects were these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The medium-term projects typically consisted of cereals production,
                    livestock production or herd rehabilitation, range management, integrated rural
                    development or, at least, area-focused agricultural projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: A few were, perhaps, but most were structured as bilateral projects.
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: But each bilateral country progra- largely in parallel with those in the
                    other countries - addressed the problems and constraints that were both present
                    in that country and typical of the region. This would be true of needs such as
                    improved varieties of sorghum and millet and seed production, though they tended
                    to be one aspect of some larger cereal production or area development project.
                    One unique livestock sector activity was the National Veterinary Laboratory in
                    Mali. It produced vaccines for use in Mali and, to some extent, in other
                    countries of the region. This activity was a constant in the Mali portfolio and,
                    until things improved a few years ago, a constant headache.</p>
                <p>At the beginning we were involved in range management in several countries. And
                    these range management activities proved to be eye-openers for a lot of people.
                    Previously livestock projects in the Sahelian countries had been mainly in the
                    hands of veterinarians and were oriented toward livestock health issues such as
                    protecting the cattle from diseases like trypanosomiasis and rinderpest. But
                    these thrusts proved problematic because they tended to maintain or even
                    increase livestock numbers without improving management of livestock and
                    rangeland resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>And there were livestock water supply components of some of these projects. A lot
                    of bore holes and water catchment ponds had been put in during the drought
                    emergency. This had its downside because the area around these water sourcewhich
                    were new and, therefore, not taken into account by the customary range
                    management practices of the herders — would get overgrazed. I think the dilemmas
                    described above provided the intellectual impetus to add range management to our
                    project portfolio. And that led to something I had never seen before. Michael
                    Horowitz, who was from one of the New York universities, began to carry out
                    “tent seminars” to tap into migratory herders' thinking and customary practices
                    concerning range and herd management issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Horowitz was from the Developmental Anthropology
                        Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, that sounds right. But, I recall now that he came on the scene
                    after we began to lose confidence in some of the methods applied in the earliest
                    rehabilitation programs. These were largely conceived and carried out by people
                    from places like Wyoming and Texas who tried to adapt U.S. practices to Sahelian
                    conditions. I can't remember the details but it became apparent fairly quickly
                    that it wasn't going to work.</p>
                <p>So then Horowitz started having these tent seminars with the herders. The aim was
                    to learn how their systems worked before trying to formulate improvements. It
                    was really quite revolutionary at that time. The AID doctrine requiring social
                    soundness analysis of all new projects came later. I wouldn't be surprised if
                    our experience with the Horowitz approach didn't contribute to that
                    innovation.</p>
                <p>What came out of Horowitz' work was a realization that the social, cultural,
                    legal-administrative and technical complexities of range management in the Sahel
                    were sufficiently daunting that we couldn't intervene with an acceptable level
                    of confidence. So we pretty much backed away from involvement in the livestock
                    production sector in the Sahel. The main exception to that statement would be
                    our involvement with the National Veterinary Laboratory in Mali. Minor
                    exceptions occurred in the context of some of our cereals production efforts
                    where we got tangentially involved in the livestock sector by financing some
                    NGO-sponsored pilot efforts to promote animal traction. This involved not just
                    the use of oxen, but also a mixed farming strategy to grow fodder for the animal
                    and recycle the manure from the animals. It didn't spread very fast as far as I
                    know. However, the French and the EEC continued to thrash around with big
                    ranches and other “modern” approaches to livestock production.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe the National Veterinary Laboratory also had a
                        regional role. Let's talk about the regional aspects of the Sahel
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, for example, we carried out some important regional studies of
                    Livestock marketing through contracts with the Center for Research on Economic
                    Development at the University of Michigan. One was called the “Red Meat Study.”
                    It focused on international and regional trade and grew out of concerns about an
                    influx of frozen meat imports into the coastal cities of West Africa. The other
                    was called the Entente Livestock Study. It focused on transportation,
                    infrastructure and production as parameters affecting the regional trade in
                    livestock.</p>
                <p>I should point out also that we had a few small regional activities with each of
                    the river basin authorities and with the Lake Chad Basin Commission. These were
                    generally related to helping them to get their archives in order, carry out a
                    few studies and to organize meetings of the member states. I believe other
                    donors and, perhaps, AID began to carry out some preliminary studies of the
                    Manantali Dam scheme.</p>
                <p>One focus of the more general river basin-related studies was what was called in
                    French, the “regime” of the river.They focused on the cycles of flow under
                    during the year and under various conditions in order to be able to gauge
                    hydropower and irrigation potentials and the infrastructure required to harness
                    them. I believe the French government or French firms were beginning to study
                    specific investments in the Senegal River Valley. I'm pretty sure they were the
                    only ones involved in such concrete schemes. And I could be wrong about the
                    timing. They may not have gotten into specific scheme development until the
                    early 80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in the integrated pest management

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, I was. There were two pest management projects. I can't remember
                    the details of the earlier one, but I got quite involved in the second. That was
                    when I was director of the Sahel Office during 1981-83. I don't know if you want
                    to get into that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: In Washington. But Integrated Pest Management wasn't on my radar screen
                    during 1974-76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'd forgotten. It would be better to finish up on
                        the Sahel.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, so in 1980, I came back to Washington after four years in
                    Cameroon. I spent about six months building up and restructuring the Division in
                    the Africa Bureau's Development Planning Office (AFR/DP) responsible for
                    economic analysis, program evaluation and donor coordination before shifting to
                    the Sahel office to become Irv Coker's deputy in the Sahel West Africa Office
                    (AFR/SWA). When he left to become the Director of AFR/DP, I replaced him as
                    Director. The Integrated Pest Management Project was one of our largest and most
                    complex regional projects. I spent a fair amount of time on that project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Integrated pest management?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) project was the second of two
                    regional pest management projects that AID funded in the Sahel. The first was
                    called the Sahel Food Crop Protection project and was implemented under a PASA
                    by USDA (It may have been the Sahel component of a wider regional project which
                    was still underway in Cameroon until at least 1978 or so). I don't remember
                    exactly when IPM came on stream, but it must have been around 1978 or 1979
                    because there was something like a midterm evaluation in about 1982. I believe
                    the project had been in the design and pre-implementation negotiation stages for
                    a couple of years before it actually got underway. It was a multi-donor-funded
                    FAO project. The idea was that all the donors contributed funds to FAO for
                    different facets of the project, and I believe FAO entered into contracts for
                    different types of technical staff, carried out procurement, made sub-grants to
                    participating governments, etc. The delays in getting the project started were
                    largely caused by protracted disputation between AID and the U.N. As I recall,
                    the main issues were whether FAO would be the master implementing agent and
                    manage donor fund(rather than just serve as the coordinating agency) and, if so,
                    whether AID could audit the project. Once AID caved in on both points, a lot of
                    paperwork was needed for the record to justify this approach on the basis that
                    FAO operating and audit systems had been reviewed and found acceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were issues even with regard to a UN agency? .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. I'm not sure why because there would seem to have been a precedent
                    in the West Africa regional onchocerciasis eradication project which the World
                    Bank, in association with WHO, implemented using pooled donor funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the point of the IPM project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>GILBERT: It combined technical assistance to national crop protection agencies
                    with applied research aimed at developing methods of pest control that were
                    effective, environmentally sound and economically sustainable at the farm level.
                    It involved minimizing the use of agricultural chemicals and maximizing the use
                    of things like resistant plant varieties, improved farming practices such as
                    changing crop mixtures in ways that would help to control pests. Part of the
                    attraction in the Sahel setting had to do with the fact that efforts to develop
                    high yielding varieties of sorghum and, especially, millet had proved
                    disappointing.</p>
                <p>A lot of scientific and technical know-how on integrated pest management had been
                    generated in Europe and America, but it needed to be adapted to Sahelian crops
                    and conditions before it could be applied. I noted while participating in the
                    wrap up of the midterm AID evaluation of IPM that a lot of ideology was also
                    involved. Some outside members of the evaluation team presented themselves as
                    taking professional risks in not making a fuss about elements of the project
                    that they regarded as impure (my expression) and threatened to “go public” if
                    they weren't accommodated on other points.</p>
                <p>I thought the IPM project was a worthwhile project at the time, but I became even
                    more of a believer later on when I worked in Sudan. There, the 2.5 million acre
                    Gezira irrigation scheme used agricultural chemicals freely, pretty much on an
                    industrial scale. And the more they used, the more they needed to increase their
                    use because they upset the nature's checks and balances. Not only did they spend
                    huge sums, they put huge amounts of chemicals into the environment. Agriculture
                    in the Sahel was, on the whole, practiced much less intensively. Nevertheless,
                    it seemed sensible to begin the process of developing low cost, environmentally
                    appropriate ways to protect their crops. It would take decades of such work to
                    unravel the chemical-intensive mess in the Gezira scheme.</p>
                <p>But the IPM project was complicated, fairly expensive, very long-term and slow
                    going. That's why it pretty much had to be undertaken on a multi-donor basis. As
                    I recall the main concerns coming out of the 1981/82 midterm evaluation were
                    that implementation had lagged and that there was a certain amount of redundancy
                    and rather loose management. I think there was a consensus within AID that the
                    project had to be streamlined and focused more tightly on the highest priority
                    endeavors. Tom Irving, by then a consultant, was the evaluation team leader. He
                    also led the team responsible for redesigning the AID contribution. I went out
                    to the field for the evaluation wrap-up in 1982. Then in 1983, I led the AID
                    side at the meeting convened in Ouagadougou by CILSS and FAO concerning the
                    redesigned AID project and, perforce, a retooling of the overall effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>As I recall we pretty much got the changes to the IPM project that we wanted in
                    our negotiations with FAO, CILSS and the other donors. The revised project was
                    authorized in early fall 1983 at about the time I left for a new assignment in
                    Tanzania. The next thing I recall was hearing about a year later that the
                    project had been scrubbed on the insistence of Niles Brady, the Assistant
                    Administrator of what is now called the Global Bureau. Let me correct his title
                    — he insisted on and received the title of Senior Assistant Administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know why he did it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No, do you? I never got a clear answer, but I always suspected that it
                    was, in some degree, a function of a right wing, atavistic dislike of the UN
                    system. But the rationale had to be couched mainly in technical and managerial
                    terms. Set up as it was, the project could only be influenced, not controlled,
                    by AID. In addition to being too multilateral, it also took a lot of money. And
                    I would guess that Brady thought AID's involvement in a delayed-impact,
                    expensive, ideologically sensitive, science-intensive area exposed him, as the
                    Agency's chief scientific and technology officer, to risks that were
                    unacceptable. As witnessed by his success in placing himself one notch above all
                    the eight or so other Assistant Administrators, he was not to be denied. I
                    suspect Lane Holdcroft knows exactly what reasons were given for the decision
                    and by what process (or circuitry) it occurred, but I've never thought to ask
                    him. Someone else who should know is the person who replaced me as AFR/SWA
                    Director, Dennis Chandler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what other regional and bilateral projects were you
                        involved in during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: By the 1980s, most of the RDOs and CDOs had become full Missions. The
                    exceptions were Gambia, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau (which wasn't even a member
                    of the CILSS during the mid-1970s). We had no presence in Chad during most of
                    the early 1980s. We had a special Sahel appropriation of something over $100
                    million. About two-thirds of that went to bilateral programs. The remainder went
                    to regional projects such as IPM, some support to the activities of the river
                    basin organizations and the Lake Chad Basin Commission, support to agricultural
                    research, studies related to development in onchocerciasis-free areas and
                    projects in support of CILSS and the Club du Sahel Secretariat operations. Some
                    of the foregoing involved contributions to non-Sahelian regional projects, such
                    as the regional sorghum and millet research projects (JPs 26 and 31, I believe)
                    that operated in Sahelian and other countries' semi-arid zones. Given that the
                    rest of Africa couldn't benefit from Sahel funds, care was taken to insure that
                    the Africa budget didn't subsidize the Sahel program. In addition to our country
                    desks, we had a regional program staff headed by an Assistant Director. That
                    group also included a budget officer, a river basin officer and, perhaps,
                    another project manager. We coordinated with AFR/DP, but also carried out within
                    our own office some of the budget management functions that they exercised for
                    the rest of the Africa Bureau.</p>

                <p>Before I go into anything else, I might as well tell about the Sahel financial
                    management issue. It became a major preoccupation and could have crushed the
                    life out of the Sahel program, but for a quite heroic response on the part of a
                    lot of people in the field and in AID-Washington.</p>
                <p>Many, if not most, of the medium-term projects in the Sahel were managed by
                    parastatal structures charged with area development, crop production or both. In
                    Burkina Faso we had an Organisme Regional du Developpement (ORD) for each region
                    and in Mali we had bodies with names like Operation Haute Vall�e and Operation
                    Mil Mopti. Sometimes these bodies were even set up expressly to implement
                    donor-funded projects. I can't recall right off hand, how our projects were
                    implemented in NigeI think there was a body responsible for farmer groups (which
                    were sort of proto-cooperatives). Because the host governments couldn't pay for
                    operating expenses, these bodies were entrusted with limited amounts of donor
                    resources to cover these costs.</p>
                <p>Before I took over as Director, audits had been launched of some eleven such
                    projects. Each audit found accounting problems concerning some of the USAID
                    funds entrusted to these national bodies. Inspector General audit reports were
                    distributed to the Hill as well as such executive branch entities as the Bureau
                    of the Budget and the NSC. There was a major flap, and I was the lucky guy who
                    had to produce a credible response to it. We had to prepare lots of briefing
                    papers, replies to lots of congressional correspondence and responses to each
                    audit recommendation. In our briefings and in Congressional correspondence we
                    stressed that the findings didn't mean that funds had been lost or stolen, but
                    only that there were problems with the “accounting trail,” something that one
                    could wish the audit reports had made more clear. We also promised a concerted
                    effort to correct the problem.</p>
                <p>Congress wrote into AID's legislation that Sahel funds could not be spent unless
                    the Administrator certified that adequate accounting systems were in place for
                    them. The Administrator delegated this responsibility to Frank Ruddy, the
                    Assistant Administrator for Africa. I think the Sahel Audits “scandal” broke in
                    1981. As I recall, the certification requirement had to be met before obligated
                    FY 1981 funds could be released for disbursement and before FY 1982 funds could
                    be obligated.</p>
                <p>The first and most important thing I did about all this was to hire John Bierke
                    to fill a vacant position in the Regional Staff of AFR. His main
                    responsibilitone that soon drove out all otherwas to coordinate or carry out all
                    the hands-on work of dealing with this problem. Bierke just pitched up and
                    needed a job about when I was beginning to appreciate the size and speed of this
                    locomotive that was coming down the tracks. It was providential. He did an
                    excellent job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Secondly, we set up a system such that before any funds could be
                    released, the mission controllers - who could get whatever help they needed -
                    had to satisfy themselves that whatever had been wrong was no longer wrong with
                    these accounting systems. And then we had to have a system for handling the
                    communications about all this with the missions, organizing the information when
                    it came into Washington and for making use of it in ways that enabled us to move
                    things along.</p>
                <p>The third thing we did was launch a regional financial management improvement
                    project. Jonathan McCabe and his staff, chiefly Roger Simmons, in AFR/DR quickly
                    designed it and got it approved. It involved putting staff in each major
                    Sahelian capital to provide financial management technical assistance and
                    training to the staff of governmental and parastatal organizations. It focused
                    initially on those associated with AID projects, but then broadened out to
                    provide input into the broader program management systems. It also provided for
                    short-term technical advisors who could trouble shoot and fix specific problems
                    that controller staffs couldn't deal with. It was implemented under a USDA PASA
                    that involved a subcontract with Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Jim Williams
                    was the Chief of Party of the VPI team. This regional project entered a second
                    phase and lasted about 12 years. I think most observers believe it had a
                    positive and lasting impact. When I was in Abidjan as REDSO Director during
                    1990-93 every so often someonincluding representatives of private accounting
                    firmwho came to call on us would mention that they got launched in the
                    accounting profession through the regional financial management project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had a very positive effect. But there is a counter view
                        of the Sahel audits issue to the effect that the “ten million dollars”
                        allegedly stolen or lost was in fact not the case. That the auditors were
                        not persistent in getting the documentation they claimed did not exist —
                        that the documentation was there but it was in French and they just hadn't
                        pursued it satisfactorily. So that was that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I think that was true in many cases and in some others there wasn't an
                    adequate accounting trail. But absence of an adequate accounting trail does not
                    equate with embezzlement. One of the things I did, though, was hire Walter Furst
                    and another consultant to go out and look at a selection of these cases and try
                    to determine whether the money seemed to have been spent for the intended
                    purposes. In other words were there items that were supposed to be paid for that
                    weren't received or staff claiming not to have been paid or local allegations of
                    how funds were misused? Using converging methods of fact gathering and analysis,
                    they checked out a handful of cases and found no evidence of significant fraud.
                    Their method didn't lend itself to finding minor leakage. And we weren't
                    interested in laxity such as, for example, a project vehicle being used for
                    personal transport. So, I don't think a lot of this money got misappropriated or
                    stolen. There was too much involvement of Americans and other expatriate
                    technicians working hand-in-hand with the Sahelian managers. So, to the extent
                    that the paperwork was unavailable rather than just being in French, I think it
                    was mostly a question of fecklessness. And, one factor contributing to that was
                    that financial personnel were accounting clerks rather than professionals. This
                    meant they were not in a position to take issue strongly with professionals who
                    couldn't be “bothered” to respect accounting rules. The new project addressed
                    that problem and helped to correct it both by raising the skill levels of the
                    financial staff and by instilling respect for financial management systems on
                    the part of operational staff and managers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. You have some other observations on your
                        experience in the Sahel and then I'd like to get on to the comment about the
                        overall significance of the program. How did you judge it and so on? But
                        what other dimensions of it do you feel were important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, our vision and the vision set forth in the legislation governing
                    the Sahel Development Program (SDP) was that it would encompass all AID activity
                    in the Sahel and be governed by a strategy grounded in the challenges and
                    opportunities of the Sahel as a region. That was the powerful and promising
                    concept, but one that we could bring only partially to reality. It fell short of
                    full fruition mainly due to conflicts that developed as the 197274 drought
                    emergency faded from memory and the people who played leading roles in
                    conceptualizing the SDP moved on to other assignments and were replaced by
                    newcomers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the focus of this conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: There were number of reasons for this. You might say that many of them
                    were structural. That would imply that they were predictable, even inevitable.
                    But, if I understand the dynamics now, it is largely a function of hindsight.
                    I'm afraid it's a longish story.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>First, some background. The main intellectual input to the early SDP came from
                    the studies that were commissioned by AID during 1973-74. As I mentioned
                    earlier, we funded several studies and I suppose other donorparticularly, the
                    Frencmay have done the same. I mentioned the many project ideas that Sam Rea and
                    I had to deal with. There was another list of project ideas (which overlapped
                    only slightly with the list Sam and I worked on) that partly predated and partly
                    was generated by the various Club/CILSS working groups. That list was poorly
                    documented and most of the items seemed not to deserve much priority. But
                    because the list emerged from CILSS-sponsored processes, it was sacred and the
                    CILSS Secretariat was obliged to put it forward at every meeting with
                    donors.</p>
                <p>We had a small Sahel Development Planning Team (SDPT) based in Bamako. Until
                    about 1982, it was headed by Larry Dash and was joined at about that point by
                    Emmy Simmons. Both Larry and Emmy are economists. As I recall, it also had
                    members responsible for education, health-population and livestock-range
                    management. Their job was to participate in the various Club-CILSS working
                    groups and help them develop sector program strategies and plans. I don't recall
                    that we envisioned an overall master strategthat is one that would establish
                    priorities among sectors and investments for all CILSS member countries. But
                    sectoral planning documentmostly menus of types or templates of projects that
                    would be responsive to sectoral constraints and opportunities - began to emerge
                    from SDPT members' interactions with the CILSS working groups. This represented
                    progress because these project templates were much better conceived than those
                    of the early CILSS list. Overall, the SDPT added a great deal of value to the
                    deliberations of the Club-CILSS deliberations, often contributing useful
                    analyses behind the scenes. My observation was that the representatives and
                    staff of the Club and CILSS secretariats held them and their work in high
                    regard. I believe the SDPT had been functioning for at least two years before
                    1980. As the bilateral programs gathered intellectual momentum and the original
                    offices evolved into conventional USAID Missions, the SDP's regional character
                    gradually weakened. By the time I came back to the Sahel Office in 1981, the
                    bilateral programs in CILSS member countries largely paralleled one another
                    because they addressed common problems. But, viewed individually, they
                    functioned about the same way as AID country programs did in most other Africa
                    Bureau countries. They were implemented through the host government's public
                    service structures or through semiautonomous bodies created by those
                    governments. Whereas at the beginning, in the mid-1970s, the “menu” of bilateral
                    projects was generated from regional processes (mainly regionally focused
                    studies), with the passage of time their evolution proceeded increasingly from
                    country-level thinking and planning. So linkages to regional processes and
                    programs became less and less meaningful in practical terms.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>There was a council or committee of Sahel mission directors' who met about every
                    six months during my tenure. Increasingly that group included individuals who
                    knew little and had less intellectual interest in the problems of the region.
                    This element viewed the Club/CILSS institutions and processes with something
                    between suspicion and outright hostility. Ambassadors placed great importance on
                    the country programs and, perhaps even more than elsewhere, made the most of
                    them in maintaining access to and influence with high government officials. I
                    have the sense that that the Sahelian Ambassadors were more operationally
                    involved in the bilateral AID programs than I have observed to be the case
                    elsewhere. Thus, they tended to share, or even exacerbate, the negative feelings
                    of some Sahel Mission Directors towards regional processes and influences.</p>
                <p>But what lay at the heart of these tensions was the simple fact that the
                    bilateral and regional components of the SDP were in competition with one
                    another for funding. Funds from the single Sahel account had to be allocated
                    among the bilateral and regional projects. The bilateral programs received about
                    two-thirds and about one-third went to the regional program. And, since we never
                    received as much as we asked for, each claimant received less than it considered
                    necessary.Of course, other factors were at work as well. Much of he regional
                    budget supported the programs of CILSS and other regional institutions. These
                    bodies were generally struggling to fulfill their mandates with staffs of mixed
                    quality. It was pretty much inherent in these bodies' mandateespecially those of
                    the CILSS institutionthat they held frequent meetings attended by
                    representatives from each member country and of the donors. When they addressed
                    a problem, they would commission one or more studies and these would provide the
                    initial focus of a regional meeting. These reports would be reviewed eventually
                    at the national level and this would often lead to an additional round of
                    discussions at the regional level. Often there would be follow up studies of
                    whether and how the regional issue manifested itself at the country level. This
                    made sense in that it gave empirical ballast to the group deliberations. It also
                    generated a sense of ownership and changed thinking among interest groups at the
                    national level. But there was no denying that this was not an efficient process.
                    Much (not all) of the work was done by a Sahelian subgroup of what the French
                    call “conferenciers” whose main qualifications were that their governments could
                    spare them, but whose influence in their own capitals varied, and, among some,
                    was distinctly questionable. Even so, the process required some involvement of
                    highly competent member government officials. Since these same officials were
                    valued counterparts, such diversions were felt at least as strongly by
                    country-level USAID and other donor program managers as by the upper echelons of
                    the member governments.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The return on all these comings and goings and circulation of papers was deeper
                    understanding of the development issues on which they were focused. The ultimate
                    aim was to build consensuses among Sahelian governments and the donors
                    concerning the policy and program implications of these issues. This payoff was
                    achieved in some cases. Unfortunately, the frequent travel and its costs were
                    more visible to USAID bilateral program managers than the national-level
                    advances in thinking on region-wide development problems. And when the new
                    thinking was apparent, it was sometimes inconvenient since existing USAID
                    projects were typically predicated on earlier, sometimes outdated, perceptions
                    and were, due to the rigidities of the AID project design and approval system,
                    famously difficult to redirect. This fits with an observation that I was able to
                    make later during visits to Sahel countries as REDSO Director and, still later,
                    as a consultant to AFR/SWA. I noted that the diffusion of program ideas from the
                    regional to the national level from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s owed more to
                    NGO initiatives, often with AID-funding, than to conventional AID
                    programming.</p>
                <p>Those of us who had responsibility for the regional program saw the negatives in
                    the Club/CILSS performance of its functions clearly and sought to remedy them
                    through technical assistance and by advocating administrative reforms at
                    Club-CILSS meetings. We had some success, but it was always a
                    two-steps-forward-one-step-backwards process.</p>
                <p>But we also had a different perspective from that of the detractors. The CILSS
                    bodies were clearly infant organizations. Even so, they were at least as
                    effective as most national level bodies. They fulfilled needed functions. It was
                    not just a matter of improving national-level thinking on development issues and
                    strengthening development programs within the region. The CILSS system had to
                    take root in the political-administrative culture of the Sahel governments.
                    Otherwise there would be little chance that regional cooperation could generate
                    regional development prospects to compensate for the region's environmental and
                    climatic liabilities.</p>
                <p>I count it as a great failure on my part that I never managed to get the Africa
                    Bureau to buy into this view of the regional aspect of the SDP. I think you and,
                    after you, DAAs Ray Love and Frank Correll largely saw the merits of prudently
                    nurturing the Club/CILSS system and other regional approaches to truly regional
                    problems and opportunities, but the Assistant Administrator would become testy
                    if one tried to discuss it with him in unbiased language. If I tried to persist,
                    he dismissively conveyed that anyone who failed to perceive that it was all
                    rubbish was delusional or, worse, afraid to confront the truth and, therefore, a
                    wimp. I think I was correct in judging that it was dangerous to provoke him and
                    that he was constitutionally (and, perhaps, politically) incapable of any other
                    posture toward the SDP's regional aspects than one of muffled hostility. Given
                    his attitude, there could be no question of the Bureau's renewing its earlier
                    active support. The pressures on my time, and that of my management team, were
                    such that we really could not afford to undertake a work of patience (i.e.,
                    trying to bring him around) that seemed to have a better than even chance of
                    blowing up in our faces.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I should digress for a moment to say that, by late 1982, our workload situation
                    had been rendered nearly insupportable. I have already mentioned the financial
                    management certification and audit report response processes that we were
                    grappling with. In addition, Africa Bureau-wide (and probably Agency-wide) staff
                    cuts forced us to reduce the AFR/SWA staff complement from something like 24 to
                    17. As I recall, the staff cuts were from on-board strength, and we were already
                    somewhat under strength due to vacancies.</p>
                <p>If that weren't enough, we had major tensions and staff morale problems due to
                    Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) issues. They started when a minority member
                    of our regional staff who had been selected by my predecessor to head up its
                    program budget side was advised that Personnel (or some authority) had
                    disapproved the necessary conversion of the position to a General Service,
                    rather than Foreign Service, designation. She had been acting in the position
                    for many months. I frankly was not sorry at the development because I had been
                    very disappointed in her performance while she was in an acting capacity.
                    Unbeknownst to me, the Assistant Administrator told her that she would be
                    promoted nonetheless in some unspecified way despite the negative ruling about
                    the conversion of her position.</p>
                <p>Sometime later, one of the Special Assistants to the AA/AFR called to say that
                    the employee had asked them about the status of her promotion and to ask me what
                    I was doing about it. I replied that I had never heard of the idea, did not
                    agree with it and couldn't see how I could implement it, even if I wanted to,
                    without being extremely unfair to other members (also minorities) of the SWA
                    staff. Some hours later that employee herself raised the question with me. I
                    told her as gently as possible what I had told the Special Assistant. That night
                    or the next night I had invited the entire office staff to my house for an
                    office party and not a single one of the minority staff of the office came.
                    Shortly after this the AA/AFR began to talk about “management problems” in our
                    office. The AFR/SWA staff member in question left our office a few months later.
                    In about 1984 (a year after I had left AFR/SWA for an overseas assignment), I
                    heard that she had been promoted in another office and that a very able
                    co-worker considered it so unjustified and unfair that he left the Africa Bureau
                    in protest.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Also, a minority senior secretary was assigned to our office even though she
                    hadn't coped successfully with a similar job in another office in our Bureau.
                    She didn't cope in our office either and made no serious, consistent effort to
                    improve. If I gave her any feedback she would disappear for days. I requested
                    that she be replaced on the grounds that she couldn't take the pressure we were
                    working under. I was ignored. I concluded that the only option remaining was to
                    document her inability to perform. Shortly after I began that process, she was
                    moved to the Management Office. I was allowed to recruit a replacement, and the
                    minority person we recruited was a wonderful addition to our staff and helped
                    greatly to turn the situation around. Meanwhile I was required to accept a
                    minority Deputy Director. He was a wonderful human being, but never really
                    learned our business and instead spent all his time representing minority
                    interests on Agency-wide committees, working groups and task forces.
                    Nevertheless, he helped to improve staff harmony and morale within our office.
                    He was also instrumental in improving our standing with some other offices that
                    had no other way of determining that we were not seriously off base on EEO
                    issues. .</p>
                <p>Though the EEO situation gradually settled down, the fact remained that we were
                    extremely shorthanded in relation to our workload. We also continued to have EEO
                    issues. One memorable one involved a minority female clerical employee who
                    understandably resented her decent, but socially awkward and insensitive,
                    supervisor's asking if she were pregnant. In his retreat before her reaction, he
                    managed as well to refer to her unmarried state. We also had a professional who
                    refused to perform his functions and accused his supervisors of racism if they
                    took issue with his unexplained hours-long absences. I think the SWA staff
                    credited my Deputy and me with handling these properly because morale among the
                    minority employees continued to improve. I don't think the attitude of the
                    AA/AFR was subject to change.</p>
                <p>So no help would be forthcoming from the front office in remedying the bias in
                    the Africa Bureau's budgetary planning processes in favor of the bilateral over
                    the regional components of the SDP. Allocations in the Congressional
                    Presentations (CPs) were only barely adequate to the needs of the SDP regional
                    program while those for the bilateral programs were more so. As the budgets went
                    from the planning to the implementation stages, the overall amount for the SDP
                    declined. The bilateral budgets were hotly defended by State because each
                    Ambassador wanted to defend the level for his or her country. This was seldom a
                    function of support for the goals of individual projects or programs. Instead it
                    reflected each bilateral program's symbolic value as a token of the recipient
                    country's standing in the foreign policy priorities of the U.S. Government. This
                    concept may have been around to one degree or another “forever”, but the rigor
                    of its application during the early 1980s was related in part to a drive within
                    the State Department to rationalize the “management” of U.S. foreign policy by
                    rigorous application of State Department strategies and programs for each
                    country and regional bureau. This State Department exercise hardly ever
                    encompassed the substance of AID's own strategies and programs, but instead
                    mainly focused on AID levels.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Though the DAAs were reasonable and open-minded individuals, they were not in a
                    position to give us much support on this issue. It was a question of what we
                    could do to solve the problem at our own level. Fortunately we discovered
                    something that allowed us to keep the SDP regional program functioning. State
                    was extremely sensitive to the relative amounts allocated to Sahel countries
                    individually, but was not tracking the relative amount allocated to the regional
                    budget versus the aggregate amount for the bilateral programs. Therefore, when
                    DP gave us new, inevitably lower total SDP budget levels to work with at various
                    stages in the budget year, we occasionally redressed the balance between the
                    combined bilateral programs and the regional one in favor of the latter. But
                    that was not enough to prevent the regional program from being considerably
                    under-funded.</p>
                <p>I knew then that good management would arguably dictate cutting one or more
                    regional projects to relieve the pressure on the surviving projects. But I
                    frankly couldn't figure out which should be cut. Also, trying at my level to cut
                    a regional project would have been a long drawn out and acrimonious process
                    given the number and types of stakeholders involved. But the clincher was that
                    there was no reason to believe that pressure on the remaining projects would be
                    reduced. In the climate of the times any amount saved probably would have been
                    removed from our regional budget.</p>
                <p>Another problem area pertaining to the regional program was river basin
                    development. Plans for various studies related to irrigation, flood control and
                    hydropower schemes in the Senegal River basin were beginning to mature and
                    gather momentum. The Senegal Mission was presenting us with funding requests and
                    issues that we couldn't effectively deal with. They had a staff member, Vito
                    Stagliano, who functioned as a river basin development officer. We had a person,
                    Dayton Maxwell, who did an excellent job of managing AFR/SWA's interest in river
                    basin matters, but there was no one in the Africa or other bureaus whom we could
                    call on to even spot, let alone resolve, the kinds of technical issues these
                    proposals posed. (As I recall, both Vito and Dayton picked up most of what they
                    knew about river basin development in the course of their work in the Sahel)
                    David's proposals were for incremental steps and mostly seemed reasonable to me.
                    Yet they cost a lot of money. Somespecially those who resented the regional
                    program and regarded these Senegal basin activities as a grab of regional funds
                    by the Senegal Missiowished, no doubt, that we would “just say no”. But that
                    would have been a betrayal of a major premise of the Sahel Development Program -
                    that river basin development would make the region food secure and economically
                    viable.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Actually, one person in the Africa Bureau did have some previous experience with
                    river basin and irrigation issues. Ray Love (the senior member of the troika of
                    DAAs who replaced you) knew some university and other experts (one was Dan
                    Hoben) and arranged for them to review the river basin development plans and
                    prospects in the Sahel. Those most closely involved in the conduct and review of
                    these survey assessments were Shear's Senegal Mission, Ray Love, Glenn Slocum in
                    AFR/DR and Dayton Maxwell in our office. I believe they were completed about
                    when I was getting ready to hand over to Dennis Chandler and head off to
                    Tanzania, and I didn't really get involved in the follow up. I do recall hearing
                    that these assessments found that introducing irrigated agriculture among a
                    population with little or no prior conditioning to its requirements is a long
                    and complicated process and that the challenges on the socio-cultural and
                    legal-administrative sides are at least as great as those on the technical and
                    economic sides.</p>
                <p>We did go along and provide limited funding for some of the Senegal River Basin
                    Organization (OMVS) activities that David Shear proposed. But they were scaled
                    back to support progress on essential increments while deferring commitment to
                    subsequent increments pending the results of additional studies and promised
                    actions by other actors. All of this meant that river basin development was not
                    likely to play the sweeping transformational role in the Sahel that we had
                    envisioned in the mid-1970s.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, grumbling by Sahel Mission Directors and Ambassadors began to grow in
                    volume and became more pointed. I can't remember a particular communication, but
                    I came to understand that they wanted a review of the SDP. I worked with the
                    SDPT and a few of the more senior and skillful people in AFR/SWR (including
                    Dayton Maxwell, for sure) to produce a review. I can't remember exactly how we
                    went about it but we did make a genuine effort to address the main questions and
                    issues as we saw them. We circulated our draft review and got little response. I
                    remember seeing a message from one Sahel Ambassador to another (which reached me
                    accidentally) that called it “anodyne.” Maybe it was. It argued for some changes
                    in emphasis and approach but recommended continuation of the SDP regional
                    program in its essentials. I never saw any refutation of our arguments or facts.
                    My interpretation was that, as a group (allowing for purer motives on the part
                    of some individuals), their object was not mere reasoned dialogue, but something
                    more concretely beneficial to their bilateral programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>When I left the Sahel West Africa Office in early fall 1983, our overall SDP
                    funding level was somewhat reduced, though still over $100 million and was under
                    severe funding pressure. I had the distinct impression that there was little
                    positive interest in the SDP regional program within AID (however, when we
                    briefed Hill staffers and people from OMB or the NSC, they always seemed very
                    positive about the SDP, including its regional component). The SDP and,
                    especially, the regional program posed challenging management problems. The
                    Club/CILSS system of policy dialogue and programmatic consultation was
                    cumbersome and difficult to keep to a predictable schedule. Therefore, it often
                    presented us with surprise demands on our time and energy. It was difficult to
                    engage the Africa Bureau technical offices in the process, and AFR/SWA (mainly
                    me) and the SDPT in Bamako had to attend a large number of meetings and speak
                    for AID. We did so without benefit of coordinated position papers and, more
                    often than not, with only a little informally established guidance. This
                    probably seems incredible, and perhaps indefensible to the reader, but we were
                    very shorthanded. We were scrambling every minute to meet the demands of the
                    programming process and, for the last year or so that I was in that job, there
                    simply wasn't anyone to whom I could delegate Club/CILSS matters. I had the same
                    problem concerning the core AFR/SWA management responsibilities, not because
                    there was no one with requisite ability, but because of the urgency and
                    magnitude of others' workloads.</p>
                <p>So the SDPT members and/or I often participated in Club/CILSS processes based on
                    positions that we had worked out ourselves with occasional input from field or
                    AFR/DR technical staff. I think we mainly did this usefully and responsibly, but
                    it shouldn't have been necessary to handle it the way we did. It was damn
                    uncomfortable and more than once I was reminded me of a visit to Cameroon by
                    former Attorney General Elliot Richardson when he was representing the U.S. at
                    the Law of the Sea Conference during the late 1970s. In a briefing to U.S.
                    Mission staff, he said that the Carter administration was not really paying
                    attention to the Conference and that he was simply doing the best he could under
                    the circumstances. He was worried that this would prevent the U.S. from
                    ratifying the treaty, and his fears turned out to be justified. The negative
                    outcome that I feared was that, when the politically appointed echelon of the
                    Africa Bureau and the Policy and Program Coordination Bureau did focus on the
                    SDP and the related Club/CILSS processes, there might be a destructive reaction.
                    I tried to guard against this by reporting on developments in cabled reports to
                    the Sahel missions and AID/Washington (when reporting from the field) following
                    major meetings and in the biweekly reports we submitted to the AA/AFR and the
                    Administrator. I didn't try to give special briefings to the AA/AFR nor use the
                    weekly Bureau senior staff meetings for that purpose. I knew the AA/AFR knew of
                    my activities and would have asked for a briefing if he wanted one.</p>

                <p>GILBERT: Yes. She was still the AA/AFR during the first six months or so that I
                    was in Washington during 1980s. That was when I was restructuring and building
                    up the economics and evaluation division of AFR/DP. I think she left just
                    shortly after I moved to AFR/SWA as Deputy Director.</p>

                    perhaps an additional six to eight months. I have the feeling that I had been
                    AFR/SWA Director for about two months when you left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some aspect of the regional perspective embodied
                        in the regional programs that was really not viable? Was there a weakness in
                        the SDP and the regional part of it in particular that made it vulnerable to
                        criticism?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I'm not sure there was anything wrong with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was a multi-cultural effort rather than a national
                        effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, and I think the problem was that it needed to be resold.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New people who did not know its history had come on board
                        and therefore they were less...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That is right. Most of the first round of mission directors and other
                    staff who had been around since the mid-1970s had bought into the SDP concept or
                    at least had come to terms with it. They realized that, even if the SDP and its
                    attendant regional processes could be frustrating, its novelty and
                    attractiveness (hopefully born of real promise) were what had made the new
                    bilateral programs possible and well funded. But as that group became diluted
                    with newer arrivals, the proportion that saw the value of the SDP declined.
                    Within the newer group, most no doubt saw the need to keep SDP concept, but
                    there was less and less willingness to consider its funding needs on the merits.
                    I'm talking about tendencies within a varied group. Among the older group, the
                    mission director in Niger for instance had been skeptical of it from the
                    beginning. It was always challenging to deal with him on SDP regional issues
                    because he was knowledgeable and not just negative. He helped to keep us on our
                    toes but was not obstructionist. Some of the other, later arriving Mission
                    Directors were too hostile to the regional and multilateral aspects of the SDP
                    to even engage intellectually and understand it.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>But, to be brutally frank, in my opinion the fundamental problem with the SDP
                    regional program was that it tied up money that some wanted to see allocated to
                    bilateral SDP programs. And even though the regional processes associated with
                    regional SDP were not particularly inefficient or disorganized compared to the
                    national processes associated with bilateral program operations, they were more
                    visible and, therefore, more vulnerable to criticisespecially in the right wing,
                    anti-multilateral culture that was seeking to impose itself on the Africa Bureau
                    and, to a lesser extent, the Agency at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any change in the political circumstances or
                        political economics of the area that would have suggested a shift in
                        interest in the regional perspective among the Sahelians themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: You mean that would have justified us changing our point of view?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, a shift on the Sahelians' part away from the
                        regional perspective to a more national one would have given grounds for a
                        similar shift in our perspective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, now that you mention it, I suppose that some of the same things
                    were happening within the national governments of the Sahel. No doubt it was
                    also true that there had been a thinning of ranks of Sahelians at the national
                    level who had participated in the formulation of the Club/CILSS system as a
                    common response to the drought. Thus, there would have been fewer individuals
                    among that group who understood and valued the SDP as a multilateral
                    concept.</p>
                <p>And I think something else happened in Niger. I think the Nigeriens let their
                    uranium deposits in the north of the country go to their head. I believe that
                    the political appointee Ambassador (who worked for a company involved in
                    exploiting them before Reagan was elected) fed that tendency by proposing that
                    ESF (Economic Security Funds) be allocated to Niger based on some sort of cold
                    war rationale. For whatever reason, the Nigeriens were sometimes awkward to work
                    with on SDP issues. But I can't recall anything parallel to that happening in
                    Mali. There, President Traore's government began to attract higher levels of
                    bilateral aid because they were the first to see the need for economic policy
                    reform. Yet I believe they remained good members of the multilateral SDP
                    “church.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the SDP regional projects made sense in economic
                        terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I think they made about as much sense in economic terms as most of the
                    other things that AID was doing. But, they were typically “less” bread and
                    butter in nature, and, with their pay-offs being longer-term, their economic
                    justification depended more on risky projections and assumptions than was
                    typical of bilateral projects. In my opinion their main weaknesseand here I'm
                    thinking mainly about the irrigation-related activitielay in the areas of
                    technical feasibility and social impact analysis. It simply turned out that the
                    regional aspects of the SDP made more sense at the conceptual level than in
                    their practical details. As a professor of mine (Charles Kindleberger) used to
                    say, “Everything turns out to be more complicated than most people think.” That
                    turned out to be excessively true of the SDP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Also, as I mentioned, most of the projects started out with little
                    reference to the economic policy framework or the importance of markets. However
                    that was pretty typical of AID projects during the 1970s. And, that gap was
                    being addressed through the Club/CILSS policy study and dialogue processes and
                    mechanisms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Were you involved at the time of Elliott Berg's
                        work on cereal pricing and things of that sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I knew about them, but had little direct involvement. I think it might
                    have been starting about when I left in 1976 and had been around for a while
                    when I returned to work on the Sahel in 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a policy issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes it was, and it was addressed in the context of the Club/CILSS policy
                    study and review process. I think it was actually commissioned for, if not by,
                    one of the working groups or study committees. Somewhat later MSU's Carl Eicher
                    and his people began working on cereals markets also. And the Berg and MSU work
                    confirmed that there were major flaws in the Sahelian policies and strategies
                    concerning food aid and food production. And thanks to these studies, these
                    issues were debated in the Club/CILSS committees and working groups. These
                    regional debates were soon paralleled by discussions at the national level. And
                    the thinking on these matters of Sahelian governments and USAID bilateral
                    missions began to change for the better.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>Over a period of years, these studies and the ensuing discussions raised
                    awareness and led to improved policies in a number of areas. They confirmed what
                    many knew or feared. The Sahelians were hooked on food aid and the donors were
                    both too dilatory and too forthcoming in providing it. The Sahelians and donors
                    tended to respond to alleged needs based on alleged supply shortfalls in a
                    context of calculated national requirements, of which some were highly
                    politically determined. No distinction was made between food availability and
                    access and no allowance was made for the fact that income from non-cereals crops
                    and livestock products could be used to buy cereals both at the household and
                    national levels. Regional trade was viewed as threatening. Most governments were
                    willing to countenance imports of supplies that they needed, but were unwilling
                    to see a portion of their cereals production be exported unless they could be
                    sure that it was a net surplus to their national requirement. The idea that
                    surplus areas of their country might export to deficit areas of neighboring
                    countries and that their own deficit areas might import from surplus areas of
                    neighboring countries was foreign. And, as I mentioned earlier, they had little
                    tolerance for market forces, and viewed prices as legitimate or illegitimate
                    based on accounting considerations. But as a result of the work of experts such
                    as Elliot Berg and others from MSU, Purdue, AIRD and Abt Associates as well as
                    roughly equal numbers of Sahelian and other donor experts associated through the
                    Club/CILSS system, these issues were analyzed with the result that policy
                    improvements gradually became major focuses of national and donor development
                    strategies and programs.</p>
                <p>In the context of all the unreconstructed thinking about cereals trade, markets
                    and prices the Sahelians through the CILSS decided that they wanted to set up a
                    regional grain market stabilization system. It may have been called a storage
                    system, but the discussion of its use was internally inconsistent as to whether
                    it would be used simply as a reserve stock in case of emergencies or for market
                    interventions. Also, no coherent philosophy was provided concerning its
                    operation. Meanwhile, they were a long way from having any shared ideas
                    concerning the proper role of the national agencies they had created for this
                    purpose. Only the Malians were showing signs of using these mechanisms for any
                    purpose beyond trying to assure low staples prices for urban populations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was an FAO initiative?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. And the FAO, still under Saouma, took on its familiar role as lead
                    advocate and got involved. I believe, to their credit, the Club Secretariat
                    adopted a posture of no more than polite, noncommittal interest. I believe there
                    were meetings in Rome and in one of the Sahel capitals. I asked Larry Dash and
                    Emmy Simmons of the SDPT to analyze the pertinent documents and attend the
                    meetings with me. We used the meetings as an opportunity to raise what we
                    believed were all the right questions and made ourselves somewhat unpopular with
                    the Sahelian agriculture ministers and the FAO. As I recall, the advocates were
                    not prepared to discuss the questions we raised, and the subject was dropped. I
                    seem to recall Lane Holdcroft telling me a few years later that it was raised
                    again after I handed over to Dennis Chandler, but once again the specific
                    proposal was dropped. However, analysis and discussion of national and regional
                    cereals markets, including the role of trade and prices, seem to have taken off
                    in the mid-1980s. I would like to think that had something to do with the rather
                    pointed discussions we had concerning the regional cereals storage and/or market
                    stabilization system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with the Club du Sahel; were you involved
                        with that operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of operation was that? Was it an effective
                        instrument for coordination of donors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Its main function was as the instrumentality for representing the donors
                    as a group in working with and supporting the work of the CILSS. On the whole it
                    was quite effective. Anne de Lattre was very effective as the Director of the
                    Secretariat. Roy Stacy and, following him, Art Fell both worked well with her as
                    U.S. Representatives on the Secretariat. I think there were two other donor
                    representatives, probably a Canadian and a Dutchman, who worked with Anne and
                    Art. They were supported by a small staff of no more than three experts who
                    mainly worked on studies and documentation, including translation. They managed
                    a fair amount of donor funding. When the Club and the CILSS agreed that a topic
                    needed to be analyzed in the CILSS framework, they would generally organize and
                    finance the required study using international and regional experts. Then they
                    would work with the CILSS in planning the regional meetings that would follow on
                    the studies. They and the CILSS did a good job of this.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>While it would be easy to snipe at the Club for little things (sometimes not
                    assuring enough notice of meetings, etc.), in my opinion, it is very difficult
                    to second-guess the Club Secretariat on the important things. But I can think of
                    two possible serious criticisms. One might find fault with some of the topics
                    they chose to pursue. Donors had the opportunity to enter objections at meetings
                    and in between meetings but, given that there were a lot of donors, we
                    understood no one donor could always have its way. The rub was there were
                    neither formal ground rules nor a very transparent process for reaching
                    decisions about Club activities between Club donor meetings. I suspect that this
                    meant that the Club pretty much did what it wanted to because any “doubter”
                    donor could be made to feel like they were alone. I personally never felt the
                    Club was wrong enough to take a strong negative stand.</p>
                <p>Another criticism of the Club might focus on the weaknesses of the CILSS and
                    blame the Club for not doing more to remedy them. But to be fair, an “accuser”
                    would have to specify what the Club could reasonably have done, but had failed
                    to do. Here again it is important to remember that the Club was the creature of
                    the donors (even if the donors had a hard time keeping abreast of its
                    activities). Therefore, it cannot be reasonably blamed for making more of the
                    CILSS' weaknesses than the donors were prepared to insist upon. Some of the
                    donors saw the CILSS as a political organ that fulfilled its function simply by
                    existing and legitimizing the common effort. The U.S. viewed it as also a
                    technical organization and had higher expectations.</p>
                <p>During my tenure as Director of AFR/SWA, I poured a fair amount of energy into
                    getting the CILSS system reformed. And, frankly, I don't recall much other donor
                    support for the U.S. position. We were not talking about dramatic stuff, but
                    rather incremental improvements in the way they did things. I worked on this
                    with Dick Meyer who, as Mission Director in Ouagadougou, was responsible for
                    day-to-day liaison with the CILSS Secretariat. Our position took account of
                    concerns raised by the Sahel Mission Directors in their semiannual meetings. We
                    also discussed our concerns with the Burkina Faso Minister for Rural Development
                    (or the equivalent, who was then Chairman of the CILSS Council of Ministers) as
                    one step along the way to presenting our concerns formally at a CILSS Annual
                    meeting in Praia, probably around fall of 1982.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>My memory of the issues we wanted addressed is far from perfect, but I'll give
                    you an approximate idea of our concerns. One irritant between the CILSS and the
                    donors was the Secretariat's behavior concerning the list of projects that had
                    been prepared by the CILSS in the mid-1970s for financing as part of the SDP.
                    Some of the projects on the original list had made considerable sense and these
                    had long since been financed by the donors either as stand-alone activities or
                    as components of larger projects. As to the more respectable items that
                    remained, these were sufficiently numerous that they could never be fit within
                    the priorities of a program of the size that the donors' funding would support.
                    As I remember it, few of the listed ideas could be dismissed out of hand. At
                    every meeting with the donors, the CILSS Secretariat put the list on the agenda
                    and argued for funding it. Their posture was that the Sahelian Ministers in
                    their wisdom had established (they didn't quite say “legislated”) this list and
                    that the donors needed to do their part and finance it. The donors couldn't
                    bring themselves in a public meeting to reject the list in its entirety, so they
                    would suggest that it be prioritized and that the most important projects be put
                    forward for review in depth. There would be no follow up between meetings, and
                    the same list, perhaps with two or three additional items, would be brought up
                    at the next public meeting. I can't remember how we phrased it, but we wanted
                    this list prioritized and focused and discussed as necessary with the donors in
                    working groups rather than postured over in formal meetings. We also wanted the
                    CILSS to concentrate on addressing technical and economic policy issues and to
                    put mendicancy on the back burner now that there was no looming crisis and the
                    main issues were of a longer-term nature.</p>
                <p>Some of the fault for this lay with the controversial Executive Secretary at the
                    time, a Mauritanian named Mame Seck. He didn't have many ideas and seemed to
                    think that he could best build his standing by being a tenacious advocate, not
                    to say a “fighter.” At one point, I thought I could build a cooperative
                    relationship with him and get him to buy into our concerns and sponsor some
                    needed reforms himself with our support. It was only when I realized that this
                    was a lost cause that we decided to bring our concerns formally to the Annual
                    Meeting of the CILSS.</p>
                <p>There were also other problems that we wanted addressed. One was the arrears in
                    member countries' dues payments. Another was related to it: the Secretariat's
                    borrowing to maintain staff levels and operations. The resulting chronic need to
                    juggle temporary financial and administrative arrangements distracted the
                    Secretariat from substantive concerns and reduced their accountability for
                    operating in an orderly fashion. There was too much crisis management,
                    insufficient clarity of staff responsibilities and a tendency to try to do too
                    much. Secretariat staff members were also prone to embark on ad hoc exercises,
                    often at the behest of various donor projects. Meanwhile we wanted the CILSS to
                    support the campaign we were launching to strengthen financial management within
                    the region and to follow through energetically and systematically on the food
                    security and related agricultural sector policy issues that were being
                    identified and analyzed in various studies.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>So these were some of the concerns we wanted to address in a speech that I gave
                    at the CILSS Annual Meeting in Praia. We (Dick Meyer; Jim Anderson, who was AID
                    Rep for Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde; and Samir Zoghby, a member of Dick's staff
                    and one of the more original characters who ever worked for AID, and I) arrived
                    in Praia several days beforethe meeting . We wrote the speech in coordination
                    with Anne de Lattre, the Director of the Club du Sahel Secretariat. She helped
                    us to avoid diplomatic shoals and reefs with the result that the some of our
                    points were made a little more obliquely than we first intended. On the whole, I
                    think we sacrificed little of substance, and the final product was the better
                    for her input. I recall that the “compte rendu” of the meeting suggested that
                    the CILSS understood our main points, took them to heart and either intended to
                    follow through or wanted us to believe they would.</p>
                <p>Even apart from the merits, we would have been foolish to cross swords with Anne
                    de Lattre without very good reason; she had very long legs within both her own
                    French Government and ours. Whenever she visited Washington she stayed with
                    Jeanne Kirkpatrick, who had been her roommate at Barnard College.</p>
                <p>A quick story about Anne will illustrate that she is a not a person to be
                    underestimated. When Roy Stacy was assigned as the first U.S. Representative on
                    the Club Secretariat he decided that a masterful way to begin their working
                    relationship would be to take her out for lunch. She graciously agreed, but
                    wanted to suggest the restaurant. He said, “Of course!” When, after their
                    sumptuous repast, he called for the check he was told, “It's on the house.” It
                    turned out that Anne owned the restaurant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think the Club and the CILSS contributed that
                        was most useful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I think the greatest value produced by the Club and the CILSS is
                    best illustrated by their sponsorship and exploitation of studies such as the
                    Berg Cereals Marketing Study that we discussed earlier. In that context I should
                    also mention another study that made a major contribution to the rethinking of
                    Sahelian economic policy frameworks. The Recurrent Costs Study came at many of
                    the same issues from another direction. That study may actually have been the
                    most valuable initiative on which they collaborated.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>We and the other donors to the SDP had, when the medium-term projects were
                    launched in the mid-1970s, accepted that we would have to finance local
                    operating costs for an initial period, but expected that we would be able to
                    phase down these contributions over time as the Sahelians increased theirs. I'm
                    afraid that we saw this as in large part a matter of getting the national
                    governments to budget realistically. No doubt, we also assumed that they would
                    be better able to do this once these rural development projects led to increased
                    production and income among farmers and herders and among agricultural
                    processors, transporters and traders. The Recurrent Costs Study was already
                    underway when I returned to AFR/SWA in 1981. When conceived, it was mainly seen
                    as a way of getting the Sahelians to focus on the issue and think through the
                    steps they would need to take in the areas of budget planning and in tax
                    administration. Once the instigators began planning in detail, they must have
                    realized that its implications were much more profound. Otherwise, they would
                    probably not have contracted the task out to three Universities: Harvard, La
                    Salle and Montpelier. Nor would they have been likely to entrust the
                    coordination function to Clive Gray at Harvard Institute for International
                    Development (HIID). I always wondered if they weren't being a little
                    disingenuous in continuing to call it the Recurrent Costs study. This title
                    helped them to “fly under the radar.” The Sahelian national governments would
                    probably have been quite nervous if they had realized the full range of issues
                    to be examined.</p>
                <p>The Recurrent Costs Study documented that the Sahel governments simply could not
                    cover the recurrent costs of the SDP projects without either cutting back their
                    financing of operational costs of other government activities and services or
                    without raising additional taxes. Cutting back was not really an option. They
                    already were making a minimal effort to provide core government services, and
                    what the Francophone countries did provide was largely dependent on budgetary
                    subsidies from the French. The only economic activities not overtaxed, were
                    unreachable due to weaknesses in tax administration. And the level of taxation
                    on reachable economic activity virtually guarantied economic stagnation in the
                    rural sectors.</p>
                <p>To raise additional taxes would require an overhaul of their tax systems and of
                    the policy framework for the agricultural sector. Most existing tax revenues
                    came from tariffs and excise taxes on external and internal trade. These, plus a
                    panoply of regulations restricting the movement of goods and services and on
                    commercial and industrial activity, had created a situation wherein producers
                    had little choice concerning their purchases of inputs and their sales of output
                    because few commercial enterprises were licensed to engage in these activities
                    and because government regulations as well as taxes on commercial operators
                    tended to keep input prices high and producer prices low.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>The only people who paid income taxes were civil servants and the tax schedules
                    were so progressive as to virtually eliminate incentives to entrepreneurs. So
                    what they needed to do was at least: 1) liberalize the economic activity in the
                    agricultural sector by freeing up trade in inputs and produce, 2) either abolish
                    agricultural price setting or ensure that price policies provided adequate
                    incentive to producers and traders, 3) overhaul the income tax structure so that
                    it provided incentives for entrepreneurs and would be enforceable and 4) improve
                    administration of the revised tax codes. There were additional needs such as
                    encouraging regional trade over international trade where appropriate, but I
                    don't think these were touched on more than tangentially at that time.</p>
                <p>The context in which this happened was interesting. This draft study began to be
                    reviewed in 1981. In the wake of the study Elliot Berg headed up for the World
                    Bank and well before the Reagan administration came in, AID had already begun to
                    realize that it needed to give more attention to economics and economic policy
                    frameworks. I believe the effort to strengthen the economics and evaluation
                    staff of AFR/DP that I worked on represented a step in this direction. When the
                    Reagan administration came in they also fostered this emphasis, but seemed
                    unable to acknowledge that it was underway before their advent. I also remember
                    feeling that there was little acknowledgement of the recurrent costs study and
                    the potential it offered for policy dialogue in the Sahel. Various offices in
                    AFR received copies and were invited to comment. But the thing was massive and
                    there seemed to be little AID engagement with it outside AFR/SWA. There was no
                    official smile or frown, it was basically as if it took place in a parallel
                    universe. Maybe it would have been different had we formally asked the Bureau to
                    approve our intended use of this study or if its recommendations should be
                    adopted. But we didn't do that because it was part of a multi-donor process and
                    the Sahelian governments and donors would meet to consider what weight they
                    wanted to assign to its findings and how these should be applied whether we
                    participated or not. And, of course, it would have been a disaster if we
                    activated an AID review process whose duration or outcome tied our hands and
                    either prevented or clouded our support for the Club/CILSS review process. My
                    Sahel colleagues (including the SDPT and some Sahel Mission economists, such as
                    Jay Smith in Burkina Faso) and I were satisfied that the report was empirically
                    based and that its analysis was sound. So, as so often happened, our
                    participation in the Recurrent Costs Study review went forward without much
                    reference to, or involvement by, AID/W.</p>
                <p>The first Club/CILSS-sponsored review of the draft Recurrent Costs Study hosted
                    by the CILSS Secretariat in Ouagadougou was the occasion of my first field trip
                    following my return to the Sahel office in about January of 1981. I think we
                    spent three days on it. At times the debate got pretty heated. And the Malians
                    were the ones who seemed most opposed to it. As I recall, they denounced all
                    this as being a neocolonialist attempt to impose capitalist ideas and practices
                    that weren't appropriate for African societies whose poor had to be protected
                    from the depredations of unscrupulous middlemen and other exploiters, etc., etc.
                    The other delegations were more circumspect in their comments and gradually
                    seemed to come around to seeing merit in the Study's arguments and
                    recommendations.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>A really interesting thing happened on the last day as we were hammering out the
                    agreed report of the deliberations. When we came to some of the points that had
                    most bothered the Malians a non-French European donor representative, outdoing
                    himself to be sensitive to the Malian concerns, strongly advocated watering down
                    some of the substantive findings that were listed as being worthy of
                    consideration by national governments. This would have been unfortunate, and it
                    produced an awkward moment of silence while the rest of us pondered how to
                    disagree without giving undue offense either to that gentleman or the Malians,
                    each no doubt hoping that someone else would ask for the floor. But, after only
                    a modest pause, the head of the Malian delegation asked for the floor to say
                    “No, thanks!” They wanted the text left exactly as it was. He gave no
                    explanation, but we soon understood. The report of the meeting was to serve as a
                    sort of issues paper for national-level reviews in member state capitals. Even
                    though they had been good soldiers and defended Mali's then current posture,
                    they wanted to make sure their government would fully appreciate and confront
                    the issues raised by the study.</p>
                <p>To come back to your question and as we discussed earlier, this kind of policy
                    review and dialogue was played out over and over again in the Club-CILSS system
                    of study groups and working groups. Policy issues and needs were studied and
                    discussed among representatives of Sahelian governments with the international
                    people present mainly in supporting roles, as experts, facilitators or donor
                    representatives mainly in observer roles. Once a study and its implications were
                    reviewed at the regional level, it would usually be reviewed at the national
                    level in a similar fashion but with Sahelians from the CILSS Secretariat or from
                    Sahelian consulting firms playing the facilitator and expert roles along with
                    the some of the members of the national delegation who had participated in the
                    regional review. This was a novel method of pursuing policy dialogue, and I
                    believe that it worked. Without it and without the Cereals Marketing and
                    Recurrent Costs studies I doubt that the bilateral programs in the Sahel could
                    have focused their programs on agriculture sector policy reform to the extent
                    they were able to.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>It is worth noting that, of all the CILSS-member countries, the Malians launched
                    the most far-reaching and genuine process of economic policy reform centered on
                    the agriculture and related-sectors. Within a year of the Recurrent Costs Study
                    review in Ouagadougou, we began to hear of very interesting developments in
                    Mali. The government and donors set up something called the PRMC, which stood
                    for the Cereals Market Reform Program. The PRMC administered food aid from a
                    variety of donors including the U.S. The food aid was sold and the counterpart
                    funds were programmed for mutually agreed purposes. It started modestly and
                    proceeded in an incremental fashion, but over a period of years the policy
                    framework and institutional landscape of Mali's agriculture sector evolved
                    considerably. I won't claim that the Recurrent Costs Study was the magic bullet
                    responsible. There were a number of influences, including Elliot Berg's study of
                    cereals marketing that had been similarly used within the Club-CILSS system. And
                    each contributed. If there's anything we've learned about policy reform and
                    policy-based programs, it's that crude leverage does not succeed without
                    significant commitment to the changes on the part of host country leadership. I
                    believe the Club-CILSS process was highly useful for producing un-coerced
                    commitment to needed reforms that greatly enhanced the feasibility and the
                    utility of bilateral policy-based programs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else on policy dialogue and policy reform?</hi>

                <p>GILBERT: Based on some of the discussions within AID/Washington about the need to
                    move toward non-project, policy-based assistance and on my gleanings from the
                    Recurrent Costs Study review, I drafted program guidance to the Sahel missions
                    suggesting they begin the long process of examining the policy problems that
                    constrained our efforts and consider whether non-project assistance would be an
                    appropriate mechanism for addressing the identified needs. I asked them to cable
                    their views before entering into dialogue with their host governments. I also
                    discussed this in one of my six-monthly meetings with the Sahel mission
                    directors. The guidance cable that I drafted never went out. As I recall, I sent
                    it around for simultaneous clearance by AFR/DP and AA/AFR as well as, no doubt,
                    by others. I don't recall that I ever got either specific comments or
                    clearances. I did get the impression that they didn't want the Sahel missions or
                    AFR/SWA to get out in front of the rest of the Bureau. I'm pretty sure that the
                    Africa Bureau never managed to issue complete guidance on this subject during my
                    tenure as Director of AFR/SWA. We went through a long period when Tim Bork of
                    AFR/GC would give contrite status reports at various meetings on his seemingly
                    fruitless and interminable efforts to reconcile some provisions in our
                    legislation with the intrinsic characteristics of non-project assistance.
                    Unfortunately, I don't recall the exact problem.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Meanwhile, at least one Sahel Mission Director, David Shear in Senegal, was
                    moving forward to develop policy-based, non-project assistance proposals. We had
                    no prescribed format for gaining preliminary approval, so his staff simply
                    invented something. I think there may have been more than one such proposal.
                    With some justification, he seemed to feel that if we were on the ball we should
                    be able to get him the Africa Bureau guidance and responses to his proposals
                    that he needed. But, alas, the relevant other offices of the Bureau would not be
                    hurried. This impasse created tensions between our office and David. I can't
                    remember all the details, except this was not the sole source of friction
                    between David and the Africa Bureau and, to a lesser extent, AFR/SWA. But
                    tension continued to build, and David took early retirement at about the same
                    time I was getting ready to go to Tanzania in 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you satisfied that the activities in the regional
                        program belonged there rather than in one or more bilateral programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: For the most part, yes. The regional program activities mostly fell into
                    the following categories: (a) support of Club/CILSS structure and aspects of its
                    regional program such as AGRHYMET, (b) support for the planning and analytical
                    activities of river basin authorities and (c) provision of centrally managed
                    technical resources focused on regional problems common to multiple Sahel
                    countries. The nearest Sahel mission could have managed most programs of these
                    types, but they would not want the funding included in the “level” for their
                    country. The regional program was in part a bookkeeping concept, especially for
                    types a and b. However, type c projects like IPM needed to be regional unless
                    there were to be separate technical assistance and coordination structures to
                    support each country's pursuit of IPM, and this would have been duplicative and
                    unnecessarily costly in time and money for both the host governments and the
                    donors. The main gray areas were those into which some of the Senegal pilot
                    irrigation schemes fit. They were sponsored in some degree by the OMVS, but I
                    believe they were situated entirely within Senegal. It could be argued that
                    these should have been included in the Senegal “level.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that the high per capita levels of assistance
                        from the U.S. and other donors to the Sahel was justified?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, that is a very hard question to address. Certainly when you look
                    at per capita aid flows to the Sahel compared to most other African countries
                    during the late 70s and early 80s, the Sahel levels were pretty high. But, I
                    seem to recall that per capita levels from all donors to Tanzania and a few
                    other countries were similar or higher. The argument for putting money into the
                    Sahel was that it was necessary to give this region the capacity to withstand
                    future droughts, not so much that it had great development potential. Except for
                    the fact that we knew that droughts occurred at average intervals of no longer
                    that 10 to 15 years, we could have taken our time. But there was a sense of
                    having to move with “all deliberate haste.” Also we were dealing with a part of
                    the world that the U.S. and, to lesser extent, the other donors (except the
                    French) had largely ignored prior to 1974. So, if the Sahel was getting a higher
                    than average per capita aid flows in the late 70s and early 80s, one could argue
                    that it was high time or, at least, not unfair. Thus, there were reasonable
                    arguments at a conceptual level for allocating large amounts of U.S. assistance
                    to the Sahel.</p>
                <p>I don't recall any systematic effort to quantify either the Sahel's needs or our
                    expectations concerning the timing and magnitude of the expected outcomes of our
                    assistance. If we had been doing this (not to say that I personally would have
                    had the requisite information, skills or time), then we might have been able to
                    determine as we went along whether our rationale continued to be valid and, if
                    not, whether we were doing enough or too much. But the Sahel is the last place
                    where one can aspire to that sort of precision.</p>
                <p>I suppose a sort of moment of truth arrived after my 1983 departure when it
                    became cleaprobably in 1984 or 198that large-scale expansion of irrigated
                    agriculture could not play its previously assigned role in transforming the
                    Sahelian economies. At that point, the problem of raising the Sahel's food
                    security status to a new plateau became a different sort of problem than
                    envisioned at the outset.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, somewhat before this point had been reached, nominal U.S. funding
                    levels for the SDP had begun to stagnate and decline. Given inflation and
                    population growth, this gradually eroded the per capita aid flow issue. If,
                    instead, irrigation's role as the engine for rendering the Sahelian economies
                    food-secure had been confirmed in the mid-1980s, increased funding levels would
                    have been required, and regional funding for other priorities such as river
                    basin authority programs and IPM would also have had increased priority.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>This is as good a place as any, I suppose, to admit to a failure on my part. We
                    had been told in about 1982 that we should produce a strategic plan for the SDP.
                    This was being requested of bilateral programs all over Africa, including those
                    in the Sahel. I don't recall receiving specific written instructions for this
                    task, however. Cabled guidance did go out to country Missions. The instructions
                    called for a much more conceptually integrated and analytically rigorous
                    approach than previously followed. For our part, we were told verbally that our
                    product should encompass both SDP regional and bilateral problems and
                    opportunities and come up with a master strategic plan containing an integrated
                    set of program priorities for each sector, encompassing regional and bilateral
                    program elements.</p>
                <p>I didn't decide at the outset not to follow through, but the task was so complex
                    I couldn't figure out how to approach it. This included not knowing on whom I
                    could safely rely as point person. The SDPT was already heavily engaged in other
                    urgent tasks, including, I believe, supporting some of the bilateral missions'
                    strategic planning exercises. Also, the new approach requested by AFR/DP far
                    surpassed in sophistication the concept of strategy development that the SDPT
                    had been applying up to then. I think I discussed it with the SDPT leader.
                    Whether I did or not, it was clear to me that determining an approach to the
                    task would take a large block of my time. As I rolled this problem around in my
                    mind while dealing with other issues, I noticed that I never heard anything
                    further from AFR/DP. And, I have to admit that I didn't remind them of the
                    informal discussions and seek to agree on an approach. I suppose I wanted to
                    propose a workable approach rather than ask an open-ended question or try to beg
                    off. I felt that the product they requested was desirable, and I wanted to
                    undertake it if I could figure out how. (I usually find that I come up with
                    solutions to problems that I can't solve immediately if I let them “percolate”
                    for a while. My “eureka” moments usually awaken me about half way through the
                    night.). But that didn't happen in this case. Either consciously or
                    subconsciously my strategy became one of hoping that AFR/DP had either forgotten
                    about or lost interest in the master SDP strategic plan that they requested
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>Of course, just as I was getting ready to depart AFR/SWA, AFR/DP asked where the
                    master strategic plan for the Sahel stood, and I had to admit with a red face
                    that we hadn't started the process yet. I was embarrassed and unhappy, but to
                    this day I feel more chagrin than guilt. Also, to this day, I still find myself
                    wondering how I could have avoided this “default.” This may sound silly or
                    self-serving. One might think that I would simply have carved the time out of my
                    schedule to either develop an approach to the strategic plan or confess that I
                    could not bring it off. My failure to do so can only be understood in the
                    context of how overstretched we were, particularly how overstretched I was
                    without a substantively competent deputy, with a much reduced office staff (down
                    from 24 to 17 professionals), with the financial management “scandal” and
                    related certification process in full swing and a host of competing demands on
                    my time, not the least of which was supervising negotiations on a complicated
                    amendment of the of the multi-donor, regional IPM project. Something had to give
                    and the thing that gave was the thing I couldn't figure out how to
                    accomplish.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>It was a salutary experience in one sense. I never again allowed myself to become
                    so enmeshed in operational needs that I lost the ability to be proactive in
                    meeting the external demands on any unit that I managed. I was in danger of
                    being in that position a few times, but each time I acted to correct the
                    situation before my back was to the wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Club du Sahel as a mechanism for
                        coordination? It was quite a unique endeavor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. In general, I think it was a good approach, though I sometimes
                    chafed at their methods. Whenever one went to a meeting, a draft compte rendu
                    would be presented for adoption on the last day. I often wondered if this
                    document had been prepared before the meeting even started. It usually seemed in
                    retrospect that the meeting had been relentlessly driven along the course it
                    recorded. Even though this is how I felt, it was not really much of an issue.
                    After all, it was the usual approach to consensus-building in such settings, and
                    the unpardonable sin would be for the Club/CILSS multilateral meetings to lead
                    to either to no consensus or a muddled one. And the process was sufficiently
                    genuine and open that the draft comptes rendus were subject to substantive
                    change at the insistence both of donor and Sahelian delegations.</p>
                <p>Because the Club Secretariat was in Paris and because many of the staff as well
                    as the Director of the Secretariat were French, I wondered if the French
                    Government saw the Club as an instrument of its policy. Whatever the answer, I
                    don't think this was in fact the case. I always felt that Anne de Lattre was
                    pretty much her own woman. Though I felt she mostly succeeded in doing what she
                    thought was right, managing her own Government's expectations must have been an
                    important challenge of the job. The temptation for the French to feel
                    excruciatingly clever had to be present. They had managed to get other donors to
                    accept a major share of the burden of assisting their former colonies in the
                    Sahel, and there was a coordination mechanism that served to focus that
                    assistance on food security and other, mainly rural development, priorities.
                    This left them free to focus their technical and financial resources on areas
                    such as finance, trade and commerce, national education and central health
                    systems that were more sensitive to their interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>But having shared these dark ruminations, I also have to say that it was,
                    overall, a good instrument for donor coordination. My experience is that donor
                    coordination is constantly talked up but seldom realized in a very meaningful
                    fashion. And these efforts too often focus on operational coordination, which is
                    devilishly difficult because of disparate donor planning and budgeting cycles,
                    rather than on harmonizing donor objectives and approaches. But when donors'
                    objectives and approaches are genuinely harmonized, this too often undermines or
                    even effectively usurps the planning and programming functions of the recipient
                    governments or encourages and facilitates their abdication of that
                    responsibility. The Club, working with the recipient governments through the
                    CILSS, emphasized harmonizing the program objectives and approaches of both the
                    donors and the Sahelian governments. As the process matured, joint review of the
                    cereals marketing and recurrent costs studies resulted in a gradual convergence
                    of thinking about various policy reform issues. For the post-Marshall Plan era,
                    it marked a breakthrough in the history of donor and donor-recipient
                    coordination at the conceptual, planning and technical levels where it counts
                    most. (Under the Marshall Plan, recipient governments were required individually
                    and collectively to formulate economic policies and programs for the U.S. to
                    review and approve for funding.) Given the capacities of the Sahelian
                    governments, the Club/CILSS framework and process came about as close to the
                    Marshall Plan system as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think the donors wanted to coordinate? Why did
                        they want to participate in it if it took time and resources to do it? Why
                        were they interested in supporting the club?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was easy to understand the French point of view. They had a
                    tremendous financial stake in the area and they were glad to have company. For
                    them the Club provided a mechanism for both encouraging other donors to share
                    the burden and keeping them intellectually on the reservation, so to speak. For
                    the other donors, the impetus to coordinate through the Club probably had a lot
                    to do with the rapid increase in the combined and individual assistance levels.
                    In a typical country the donors have been working in their respective patches
                    for years and coordination is important only when one them moves into a new
                    area. But in the Sahel all the donors except the French were implementing
                    quantum increases in their assistance levels on a rush basis. And they were
                    doing so in a region where they had relatively little experience. Thus they
                    needed to coordinate to avoid operating at cross-purposes or duplicating one
                    another's efforts. In addition, where there is a sense of uncertainty and
                    risk-taking it is only human to seek both comfort and safety (and, in case of
                    mistakes, cover) in numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the U.S. interests in the Sahel? It wasn't very
                        strategic, I guess. There wasn't much political security interest. Or was
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I truly believe that the people who were behind it in the U.S.
                    bureaucracy basically saw this as an opportunity to increase aid to Africa in an
                    area that had been neglected in the past and would be again in the future unless
                    they could harness the sudden humanitarian interest occasioned by the drought
                    emergency to attractive longer-term prospects. And there was a good rationale at
                    hand. The idea was that prophylactic assistance to develop the capabilities of
                    the area would diminish the scope of future drought emergencies and the scale of
                    emergency assistance needs. The nearest thing to a real politik rationale might
                    have focused on the potentially destabilizing effects of mass migration of
                    Sahelian populations into the coastal West African countries if life became too
                    harsh for them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I hope I'm not being na�ve, but I frankly don't think so. Right offhand,
                    the only countries with much East Bloc presence or involvement were Cape Verde
                    and Guinea-Bissau. They were pretty marginal members of the CILSS, and they
                    received pretty small amounts of assistance. If Cape Verde got more than its
                    proportionate sharand I'm not saying it diit was because of the substantial Cape
                    Verdean immigrant communities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what about the political context in terms of the
                        Administration's and Congress' interest in assistance? Did that have any
                        significance for this at that time? This is what...during the Carter
                        administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it was during the dying days of the Nixon administration and
                    throughout the brief Ford administration that the Sahel development program got
                    set up and acquired its multilateral quasi-legal personality and institutional
                    trappings as well as its U.S. legislative mandate. I suppose its financial and
                    operational momentum developed during the Carter years.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>As to your question about the kinds of Administration and Congressional interests
                    involved, something comes to mind that may at least be partially responsive. It
                    seems to me that the surprising thing is that Congress and the Administration
                    would sanction a new, additive flow of U.S. development assistance to a
                    previously ignored area that was on the sidelines of the cold war proxy
                    struggles in Africa. This is pretty out of character. The only explanation I can
                    think of for its occurrence in this instance (as opposed to others where better
                    substantive arguments could be made that the U.S. should support long-term
                    development) may have to do with the earlier humanitarian effort. There had been
                    a great deal of public support for the U.S. response to the 1972-74 drought and
                    famine. In fact, U.S. public opinion did a lot to galvanize the U.S. into
                    responding at the outset, and I can tell you that there was a fair amount of
                    suspicion among some in the Black community that we weren't doing enough.
                    Meanwhile, since then we have learned that the man in the street strongly
                    supports humanitarian assistance even though he is alleged not to favor
                    development assistance. The rationale for the SDP was an extension of that for
                    the humanitarian assistance of 1972-74. The SDP was sold as a preventive
                    approach to emergency humanitarian assistance. It may also be that there was
                    greater susceptibility to the implied altruism because of the national trauma
                    generated by our experience in Vietnam. It may also be that the SDP, with its
                    multilateral character and the overtones of partnership with the French and
                    other European donors resonated with or supported some aspect of U.S. policy
                    toward Europe. But I really don't know what that might have been.</p>

                <p>Four years in USAID/Cameroon - 1976-1980</p>
                <p>GILBERT: I went to Cameroon in 1976. And I spent four years there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Cameroon at that time? Why were

                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Cameroon was treated as an honorary Sahelian country during the Sahel
                    drought and in its aftermath. Yaounde was the site of one of the Regional
                    Development Offices (RDOs) that we talked about earlier. RDO/Yaounde had
                    responsibilities for Chad, which became a CILSS country, and for the Central
                    African Republic (later Empire), Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. During the Sahel
                    drought, the RDO was responsible for administering emergency assistance for Chad
                    and, to some extent, for Northern Cameroon, which has a lot in common with the
                    Sahelian countries. Cameroon was the route of choice for shipment of food
                    assistance to Chad. It traveled by rail from Douala to Ngaoundere and then by
                    road to Ndjamena. Some of the bilateral projects on the books when I arrived
                    there in 1976 bore all the hallmarks of Sahelian medium-term projects. Q: But
                    they were not included in the Club du Sahel.</p>
                <p>GILBERT: Cameroon was not a member of the CILSS and, thus, did not participate in
                    the Club/CILSS forums.</p>
                <p>I was assigned to Yaounde as Deputy Regional Development Officer, replacing Art
                    Fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a full mission at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No, it wasn't. I think there were only six U.S. direct-hire officers.
                    John Koehring was the Director. Al Henn was the Regional Health Officer. Norm
                    Greene was the Regional Human Resources Officer. John Woods replaced Glenn
                    Slocum as the Regional Program Officer, arriving at about the same time I did.
                    Tex Ford arrived not long afterwards to serve as the Regional Agriculture
                    Development Officer. I can picture the guy he replaced, but I can't think of his
                    name. Then somewhat later Eric Witt arrived as an Agricultural Economist
                    International Development Intern (IDI). Tridib Mukherjee, who later became a
                    direct-hire, was there as a project technician, I believe. There was no
                    Management Officer at the outset. That role was pretty much exercised by John's
                    Administrative Assistant and John himself. For someone whose previous field
                    service was in Ghana and Nigeria, it had a distinctly “mom and pop” feel to it.
                    We were really busy with developing the new elements of the program while also
                    winding down the earlier generation of regional projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it rightly called a regional office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. The office was responsible for managing a number of regional
                    projects that covered Chad, CAR and Gabon as well as Cameroon. These projects
                    focused on health training and disease control, agriculture, livestock,
                    development administration training and low-cost housing. These projects may
                    have covered Equatorial Guinea in principle, but not in practice. Equatorial
                    Guinea at that time was still “Heart of Darkness” country under Macias, who was
                    a real monster.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not the Congo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Congo-Kinshasa or Zaire always had its own full bilateral Mission until
                    the late 1980s. But, now that you mention it, I'm surprised that we weren't
                    given some responsibility for Congo-Brazzaville, but I'm quite sure that we
                    didn't have it. Maybe that country was totally off AID's radar screen.
                    Alternatively, USAID-Kinshasa may have covered it.</p>
                <p>Soon after I arrived, in about November 1976, we handed over all responsibility
                    for management of AID projects in Chad to John Lundgren, the Director of the
                    Country Development Office there. I believe my first field trip involved
                    accompanying John Koehring to Ndjamena where Lundgren was just setting up shop.
                    When we pulled into the compound that contained both his office and his house,
                    he was literally crawling around well up in a large tree for reasons that I
                    can't reconstruct.</p>
                <p>I recall that there was a certain tension in the air about what the relationship
                    would be between that office and us. I think there may have been some
                    uncertainty whether we should retain some kind of substantive oversight
                    function. As it turned out, apart from some financial management backstopping,
                    our main responsibility for support of the Chad operation was to help assure the
                    movement of project commodities and, occasionally, emergency relief supplies to
                    Ndjamena. There may also have been an understanding that our technical experts
                    might be called upon for advice from time to time, but I don't recall that that
                    ever amounted to much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have bilateral programs in each of these
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Bilateral programs were to be developed in Cameroon, Chad and CAR, but
                    not in Equatorial Guinea or Gabon. I mentioned the problem with Equatorial
                    Guinea. Gabon had too high an average per capita income to qualify for AID
                    assistance. Q: So you were shifting away from the regional programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, in part. Most of them were coming to the end of their intended
                    spans. These included Central Africa Livestock and Meat Marketing, National
                    Advanced School for Agriculture (a Cameroonian institution that served the
                    region as well), Gabon and Cameroon Low Cost Housing and the Pan African
                    Institute for Development (PAID). Our nascent bilateral program in Cameroon
                    consisted of some projects that were, in effect, medium-term projects and were
                    similar in thrust to those coming on stream in the Sahel. Projects in this
                    category were North Cameroon Livestock and Agriculture Development (earlier
                    known as the Mindif-Moulvedaye Project), North Cameroon Seed Multiplication, and
                    North Cameroon Rural Health Service. But other bilateral projects represented
                    continuations of Cameroon-based elements of regional projects. These included
                    University Center for Health Science (CUSS), Practical Training in Health
                    Education and Cameroon Low Cost Housing. Meanwhile at least one regional
                    project, PAID, continued as such. This made quite a diverse portfolio. Given
                    that and the challenge of working in a Francophone environment, it was an
                    exhilarating experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, a number of things come to mind. One is the formality and
                    fussiness of Francophone administrative culture. I worked there for four years.
                    Even two or three years into that period, many Cameroonian contacts still
                    addressed me as “Monsieur le Directeur Adjoint.” They addressed one another that
                    way as well. If they felt playful or informal they might exaggerate one
                    another's titles. I can remember the Secretary General in the Ministry of
                    Economy and Plan and one of his colleagues calling one another “Mon General.”
                    And there was never a question of getting beyond that to being on a first name
                    basis. If one developed a genuine relationship with a Cameroonian, it would only
                    lead to calling one another by family names, as often as not still preceded by
                    “Monsieur”. The French generally went rather quickly to that stage, but I can't
                    recall being on a first name basis with more than about five French and
                    Cameroonians with whom I sang in a madrigals group. At first, not wanting to
                    sound officious, I would introduce myself as “Gilbert” rather than “Monsieur
                    Gilbert.” I can still remember the stricken looks this produced on some
                    Cameroonian and French faces. Gilbert is more common as a first name than a
                    family name among the French, so they thought to themselves: “This crazy
                    American is introducing himself to me by his first name and must, therefore, be
                    expecting the unthinkablthat I respond in kind! Quelle horreur!! I soon learned
                    to quickly add, “Frederick Gilbert.” If I said “Fritz” instead of “Frederick,”
                    that would chew up a couple of additional minutes because it would never be
                    heard properly the first time or two, so that went by the boards. All of this is
                    not to say that I didn't develop strong relationships with a fair number of the
                    Cameroonians and the French. Eventually one got used to the veneer of formality
                    and attached no undue significance to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Also, it was really striking to me how denatured some of the Cameroonian civil
                    servants seemed as Africans and how hard they worked at being cosmopolitan.
                    Every time we signed a project agreement there would be a little ceremony and
                    out would come champagne and canap�s to celebrate the occasion.</p>
                <p>Another thing that struck me was strictly Cameroonian and/or Central African and
                    had nothing to do with language or administrative culture. We were developing
                    and implementing quite a few new projects, and this required that we negotiate
                    on a variety of small and large issues with Cameroonian middle managers. Most of
                    the time it went more or less as well as one would expect in many other African
                    countries. But, from some of these individuals, we ran into a buccaneering,
                    “what's-in-it-for-me” attitude that you had to see to believe. It was shocking
                    how crudely interested some of them were in the commodities as opposed to the
                    substance of the project. We were often pressured (unsuccessfully) to provide
                    vehicles for use by officials who had little responsibility for the activity in
                    question. With these types I sometimes had the strong feeling that if one were
                    alone with them and safe enough from other ears, there would have been a blatant
                    demand for a “backhander.”</p>
                <p>It brings to mind an old saying to the effect that it takes generations to
                    produce a gentleman. I believe most of the people who were civil servants in
                    Cameroon had adequate formal educational backgrounds. But a very high percentage
                    of them were members of the first educated generations of their families.
                    Education and gentility don't necessarily correspond any more than affluence and
                    gentility do, but I think these guys were the first in their families to find
                    roles in the modern sector. In contrast, the fathers, and sometimes the mothers,
                    of many of the Ghanaian and Nigerians with whom I worked had been clerks,
                    teachers or other professionals. And some of them came from families with long
                    histories of education and modern sector employment.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>But this difference may only be part of the explanation for what I observed. I
                    believe the other part is that the interior sections of the country had been
                    subjected to rather harsh brands of German and French colonial administration.
                    Both colonial powers' reliance on forced labor for public works caused much
                    illness and many deaths and left a legacy of bitterness that Cameroonians would
                    occasionally and fleetingly mention. I noticed also that the police and
                    gendarmerie behaved in more frankly predatory fashion than was common even in
                    Nigeria. We never sent people, especially those without official passports, on
                    field trips without arming them with Ordres de Mission (a “To Whom It May
                    Concern” letter explaining the purpose of the travel with several impressive
                    looking stamps on it) to protect them from harassment en route. I believe that
                    the combined effect of these factors was to create a gulf between grassroots
                    Cameroonians and their government and to furnish them with examples of
                    anti-social modern sector behaviors. As for those who lacked countervailing
                    influences in their upbringing and education, it is regrettable - but not all
                    that surprising - if they came to the modern sector ill prepared to behave as we
                    would think proper. That's what I believe lay at the root of my encounters with
                    a minority of Cameroonians who were called upon to represent their country but,
                    instead, mainly represented themselves in a pretty shabby manner.</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that the Cameroonians who came from the North or from the Coastal
                    parts of both the Francophone and Anglophone sections of the country seldom
                    exhibited the quality that I found so startling. I also should reiterate that I
                    worked with many civil servants from the remoter parts of the country who
                    exhibited all the dedication and integrity that one could hope for. One of the
                    most striking things about the Cameroonians as a group compared to the Ghanaians
                    and Nigerians is how little given they were to jokes and laughter. As one who
                    has actually been informally reprimanded by at least two bosses for being too
                    much given to levity, I felt this difference acutely.</p>
                <p>Maybe the most important thing about the Cameroonian Government was that it was
                    overstaffed and under-skilled, especially at the lower levels. The reason for
                    this was historical. The Anglophone parts of Cameroon, which had been governed
                    by the British as part of Nigeria under a U.N. trusteeship, voted in 1961 to
                    join newly independent Cameroon. That result was a federation of the Anglophone
                    and Francophone parts of the country. In 1972, a few years after a procommunist
                    rebellion had been bloodily suppressed, Cameroon was declared a unitary state.
                    This meant that the government of the Anglophone part was abolished and its
                    workforce was integrated into the national civil service. This resulted in
                    massive overstaffing except at the higher skills levels. At the lower end, most
                    had little to do and lacked French language skills. However skilled and
                    motivated some of these people might have been at the outset, most had long
                    since succumbed to apathy by the time I got there. On entering the ministry
                    buildings one walked among clerical workers who were openly sleeping on their
                    typewriters. The average level of activity rose gradually as one went up the
                    grade scale. At the professional levels, the staffing situation shifted from
                    surplus to shortage.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main lines of our program that you were
                        working on at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Let's see. In agriculture, we were concentrating on the Northern
                    Cameroon-focused Seed Multiplication and Livestock and Agriculture projects.
                    These dated back to the immediate post-drought period. The Seed Multiplication
                    project was, I believe, started with emergency funds and then gradually grew in
                    scale and evolved into a conventional, more broadly focused seed project. Later
                    we got involved in agricultural research and agriculture planning projects at
                    the national level. The North Cameroon Livestock and Agriculture project was
                    known locally as the Mindif-Moulvedaye project after the two districts where it
                    started. It had both animal health and range management components. It seems to
                    me that we had a lot of trouble getting it off the ground. While John was still
                    there we hired a young guy named Ric Carron to develop an implementation plan
                    with the concerned agriculture officers in the northern center of Garoua. I
                    can't recall clearly what happened, but I can remember moving forward in an
                    incremental way using mainly short-term technicians on preliminary logistical
                    and infrastructure improvements, such as drilling wells and setting up watering
                    points. I vividly remember that we were having trouble finding water until some
                    international expert using the local equivalent of a birch rod, on an unpaid
                    basis, told us where to drill. (Sander Levin, then AA for the Science and
                    Technology Bureau who was passing through on a visit, took the rod and planned
                    to use it as an example of appropriate technology when he testified before
                    Congress.) John left in late 1977, and I was Acting Director for about a year
                    until Jim Williams arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, as the Director around the beginning of 1979. Some time in early
                    1988, we became a full USAID Mission, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the core of the problem with the North Cameroon
                        Livestock and Agriculture project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I had a lot coming at me during my time as Acting Director, including
                    the development of a program strategy that I presented in Washington in February
                    1979 once Jim had arrived and approved it. North Cameroon Livestock was just one
                    of many that we were trying to get approved or launched into implementation. So
                    I don't recall the details. But I think we ran up against the same problems we
                    been encountering with other livestock-range management projects in the Sahel.
                    Briefly, we realized that it didn't make sense to improve livestock health,
                    improve access to drinking water and improve the herds genetically without also
                    addressing range management issues. But figuring out how to make marginal
                    changes in these systems that would actually add up to a net improvement was an
                    extremely daunting task. The systems were extremely complex and difficult to
                    understand. Without a comprehensive understanding, the potential for
                    unanticipated negative consequences was enormous. And it would be unconscionable
                    and unworkable to make such changes without the informed consent and support of
                    the livestock producing community. I believe these realizations were sweeping
                    the Sahel and they engulfed us at about the time I was getting ready to leave,
                    and that project had about reached the point where all that could usefully done
                    by way of preliminaries had been completed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well what other programs...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, we had an interesting project called Mandara Mountain Water
                    Development. Someone from another donor agency or an NGO had identified over a
                    hundred sites where construction of small dams could provide household water
                    supplies and support small-scale irrigation plots. It was also determined that
                    the dams could be built on a labor-intensive basis during the dry season. Once
                    that project was launched and going along pretty well, we got the idea of
                    launching a Mandara Mountain rural development or, maybe even, integrated rural
                    development project. But that turned out to be a non-starter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember the context of why we got involved with
                        these projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I think so. This was during the time when AID launched a campaign to
                    focus its programming on the “poor majority.” But in some quarters of AID this
                    got translated into “the poorest of the poor” And the Mandara Mountains were a
                    very hardscrabble part of Northern Cameroon. The mountains were very densely
                    populated and very intensively farmed.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>It really is an intriguing part of Cameroon. It is analogous to the mountainous
                    parts of the middle belt of Nigeria, to the Dogon country in Mali in West Africa
                    and to the Nuba Mountains in Sudan. The people of these areas seem to constitute
                    remnant populations that took refuge in the mountains when the nomadic herders
                    and mounted raiders who were the ancestors of the present-day settled, mostly
                    Muslim majority populations (such as Cameroon's Fulani) migrated into the
                    surrounding plains hundreds of years ago. Typically, these mountain dwellers
                    have remained stubbornly pagan. In the Mandara Mountains, as in the Nuba
                    Mountains and the Nigerian middle belt mountains, the populations share many
                    cultural traits. In each of these areas, though, there is a surprising variety
                    of languages. Like the Dogons, the people of the Mandara Mountains are skillful
                    farmers and work like they're killing snakes. They make extensive use of
                    terraces and cultivate every square centimeter of available land. They have even
                    found ways of integrating livestock into their systems so they could have manure
                    for their crops. But their technology was essentially Neolithic. Owing to this
                    and overwhelming population pressure on the land, theirs was a nearly
                    self-contained subsistence economy.</p>
                <p>But how could they be more deserving? I'm sure that I was among those to whom it
                    seemed that, given their poverty and the Agency's interest in integrated rural
                    development, developing a Mandara Mountains Area Development project on the base
                    of the Water Resources project was the obvious thing to do a “no brainer” in
                    today's vernacular. Well, it turned out to be a “no brainer” in another
                    sense.</p>
                <p>As part of the design process we needed an agricultural assessment to determine
                    the scope for increasing agricultural incomes and launching other economic
                    activities as part of such a project. We turned to MSU for this task because we
                    all had high respect for them, and there was a contractual mechanism that
                    offered ready access. What happened next was rare indeed. Very seldom do
                    assessments recommend against the thing in question, but that's what happened in
                    this case. They said, in effect, that it was good of us to want to help these
                    people, but our idea wouldn't work. The technology that would allow them to
                    support a larger population or to raise the level of living on the available
                    resource base simply didn't exist. The main hope for the people of this area was
                    to increase their access to basic education and skills training so their young
                    people could find livelihoods in the larger economy and, thereby, begin to
                    integrate the Mandara community into the larger society.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>The integration and the outflow of young people part was, no doubt, music to the
                    ears of our counterparts because this is what they had been hoping for when they
                    encouraged us to get involved in the Mandara Mountains. We had gradually become
                    aware of this sentiment and were wary of it because we felt they had impure
                    motives: to Islamize and otherwise to bring that population into a more normal
                    (read dependent) relationship with the northern power structure. The
                    recommendation to educate and train the potential migrants may have been less
                    welcome; we understood that the northern power structure wanted the Mandara
                    Mountains to supply labor to commercial farms owned by the “Al Hajjis,” i.e. the
                    powerful merchant class who were a major force in the economic and political
                    life of the country.We knew it was thorn in the side these folks and the
                    authorities that the people of the Mandara Mountains retained their pagan
                    folkways, were neither Muslim nor Christian, and managed to eke out an adequate
                    livelihood without significant reliance on the larger economy of Northern
                    Cameroon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have a program there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The Mandara Water Resources project went ahead but I don't think we
                    built as many dams as initially thought possible. There was also a small NGO
                    grant for construction of hand-dug wells in parts of the Mandara Mountains where
                    aquifers were close to the surface. We also financed a project called Training
                    for Young Farm Families that was implemented by a Swiss NGO and partially served
                    the Mandara area as well as other sections of Northern Cameroon. But there was
                    no systematic programmatic response to the MSU findings that I know of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: CARE was working there at one point? I remember visiting a
                        well pump that they provided.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. I don't remember much about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was pretty small.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: We were involved in professional-level agriculture education at the
                    National Advanced School of Agriculture a few miles outside Yaounde.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a university?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, as I recall, it was part of the university system but mostly
                    provided sub-degree-level training. Later on we undertook the intellectual
                    spadework for a University Center for Agriculture Education at Dschang (in the
                    northern part of South West Cameroon). We also had a project with the
                    agriculture and livestock part of the national research structure called
                    ONAREST. That project involved providing improved breeding stock to small mixed
                    farmers in North West Cameroon. Our involvement in seed multiplication led to
                    the establishment of a National Cereals Research and Extension project toward
                    the end of my time in Cameroon.</p>
                <p>The biggest project we had was Trans-Cameroon Railway Phase III for realignment
                    of the track between Douala and Yaounde. That project was in the preliminary
                    discussion stage when I arrived in 1976. To my initial consternation John
                    Koehring asked me to serve as project manager for Transcam III while continuing
                    to carry my Deputy Responsibilities. I was right to be concerned about the
                    workload implications, but it turned out to be one of the most rewarding aspects
                    of my Cameroon sojourn.</p>
                <p>Jim Hradsky of REDSO was responsible for hands-on capital project development
                    work. That turned out to be quite complex. It involved engineering, economics,
                    social soundness and environmental studies, which meant not only that he was
                    frequently in Yaounde, but also that all sorts of other interesting people were
                    continually coming and going as well. He did an excellent job. Moreover, it was
                    a multi-donor project so that I had to work quite closely with a wide array of
                    the higher-ups in donor missions and embassies as well as in the concerned parts
                    of the Government, particularly the OCFT, which was the independent authority
                    responsible for planning and managing the development, as opposed to the
                    operation, of the railway. Overall coordination on the donor side was the
                    responsibility of the European Community Delegation, and a member of the
                    Delegation served as Technical Controller for the project. I was also the point
                    man for dealing with some difficult issues concerning the transparency and
                    fairness of the procurement arrangements for the various aspects of the project.
                    This was an interesting problem because the European donors as a group were
                    inclined to be cavalier about these issues. As luck would have it, they came to
                    a head while I was Acting Director for the better part of a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the purpose of the project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: There were several bottlenecks between Douala and Yaounde and maybe some
                    to the north too. The idea was to straighten the track alignment, put in
                    additional sidings and install better signaling and switching equipment so as to
                    make it possible for the trains to go at a higher average speed and move more
                    freight.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>The OCFT was headed by one of the most efficient and likeable people I ever met,
                    Jacques Houdet. I noticed once that he wore the red lapel pin of the Legion
                    d'Honneur and asked him how he earned it. He said in French, “Monsieur Gilbert,
                    you don't have to do anything to earn it, but you have to do it for a long
                    time.” The pressures of that job and, probably, some personal grief probably
                    caused his death of a heart attack while I was out of the country on leave in
                    1978 or 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the project was approved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, and considerable progress was made on implementation before I left
                    in 1980. It had to be signed off on by the Director of REDSO/Abidjan as well as
                    John Koehring. Hradsky and I realized that if we hoped to get the project
                    approved on a timely basis, we had to maintain control of the documentation
                    process ourselves rather than let it come under the control of REDSO. The danger
                    was that it would have been difficult to prevent REDSO reviews and wrangling
                    over drafts that were necessarily imperfect, but that we knew how to fix. We
                    wanted to resolve the issues we understood to our own satisfaction in hope that
                    REDSO's eventual review would mainly focus on any issues that we didn't know
                    what to do about. Put another way, we didn't want them snatching at issues that
                    we were still working on directly with various design team members and with
                    OCFT. So I arranged to give Hradsky purchase orders so that he could get the
                    paper typed outside of REDSO and its paper flows. That tactic worked. Once we
                    had resolved all the issues that we could see to the best of our ability, we
                    simply sent the final package to REDSO for its concurrence, and the project was
                    approved in a fairly timely fashion.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we will come back to that. This was a multi-donor
                        project? Who else was involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was a multi-donor project. The French, the European Community and, I
                    believe, the German international development lending arm (KFW). The
                    construction contract went to an Italian firm called IMPREGILO that had done
                    previous work for TransCam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the U.S. part of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Good question. We couldn't supply the operating equipment because of the
                    incompatibility of U.S. and European specs. I'm trying to remember the elements
                    that we picked up The project was divided up into separate bid packages for
                    various donors' financing because most donor-financed procurement was tied. I'm
                    having trouble remembering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe it was steel track, steel rails, maybe other
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>GILBERT: You're right. Steel rail was, I believe, the most important part of the
                    U.S.-financed package. I think we may also have financed some of the
                    construction machinersuch as bulldozers and earth moving equipmenthat were
                    needed by IMPREGILO. It was great fun to be associated with a project that
                    progressed and contributed in such a tangible way. It was also pleasant to visit
                    the worksites, sometimes by special train, to inspect progress and enjoy quite
                    good meals at the IMPREGILO camp. I imagine one would have to write a memo to
                    the IG now if we did that. Now that I think about it, we were probably suborned
                    on these occasions!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I guess it was finished after you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it went forward like clockwork compared to so many of our efforts.
                    I remember attending the dedication of the realigned sections including some new
                    depots, staff housing, signaling equipment, switches and sidings. However, the
                    final reporting and financial closeout may still have been underway when I
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it your impression that it was a successful project?
                        It was often hard to tell I guess, until later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I think it was a successful project. I think it met an important need.
                    The country had very few paved roads running in any direction, but most
                    strikingly only a portion of the road between Douala and Yaounde was paved and
                    the first stretch of paved road going north from Yaounde began at the Ngaoundere
                    railhead and went through Garoua and Maroua to the Chadian border. So the rail
                    line was the backbone of not just the transport net but also of the economy of
                    eastern Cameroon, which was the bulk of the country. The improvements were
                    selective and carefully designed to enhance the efficiency of the system.
                    Engineering and economic studies bore this out. It also served Chad since it
                    depended on the rail line for most of its imports and the evacuation of its
                    exports. As I recall the project came in pretty much at cost and on
                    schedule.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>The other major project that I recall from those days was one that grew out of
                    some health care training activities that we had with the Medical School (CUSS)
                    and the Ministry of Health. We had a Harvard University team working at CUSS and
                    at the University Hospital during the whole four years I was there. I believe
                    that they and a group who were working on in-service training of Ministry
                    primary health workers both managed to introduce some training in the provision
                    of family planning services. The new project was called Medical System for
                    Cameroon (MEDCAM). There was a Title XII-type collaborative design arrangement
                    with a group called MEDEX that was associated with one of the top Medical
                    Schools in the U.S. As I recall they had made a name for themselves in
                    establishing decentralized community-level primary health care structures
                    relying mainly on nurses and midwives backstopped by physicians and higher-level
                    health facilities. MEDEX sent out a quite capable and hardworking young MD/MPH
                    to work on a technical level with the Cameroon Ministry of Health and CUSS.
                    Among other things, it involved setting up something called Pro-Pharmacies,
                    which would be community-controlled, would stock only basic drugs, would procure
                    independently from private wholesalers rather than depend on the Government
                    Central Pharmacy and would be financially sustained by the community.</p>
                <p>This concept had revolutionary implications. Nurses and midwives were already
                    providing most medical services at the village level as best they could on an
                    informal basis. But the idea of making sure they had the requisite training and
                    official sanction for their performance of these services ruffled feathers among
                    many Ministry of Health doctors. Also not depending on the totally
                    nontransparent and quite inefficient Central Pharmacy posed problems whose exact
                    nature no one seemed able to clearly explain. There was also the need to plan
                    the renovation and equipping of health posts and health centers and the training
                    of nurses, midwives and pharmacy assistants needed for phased expansion of the
                    system. I can't remember for sure, but I'm pretty sure that we were planning to
                    start with pilot areas. So we were working both on Ministry of Health-level
                    primary health management and planning issues and on district and village-level
                    delivery-of-services-and-medicine issues. It was necessary that USAID Cameroon
                    participate in this process since we were unprepared to give MEDEX carte blanche
                    which they, in any case, did not want.</p>
                <p>I was asked to coordinate the common effort that involved MEDEX, the USAID Health
                    Division and the Project Development Office. Sometimes these parties' points of
                    view diverged sharply. Thus, I was continuously engaged in resolving issues that
                    arose among the AID parties while managing the U.S. side of a dialogue with the
                    Ministry of Health. We needed to consult the Ministry of Health but avoid
                    letting this degenerate into separate dialogues or, worse yet, negotiations with
                    each U.S. party. The Government had designated Dr. Atangana, the senior
                    technical person in the Ministry of Health, to coordinate this work with us.
                    Leading our discussions with him in French was a key part of my
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>I think most of those who were involved in this felt that, though frustrating at
                    times, this was a very worthwhile effort. I would even say it was exhilarating
                    in that we were actually working daily in hands on collaboration with senior,
                    technically competent Cameroonians frankly discussing real issues and
                    opportunities and arriving at agreement on the substance of a far-reaching and
                    workable project. It was so wonderful that it turned out to not be true. The
                    project got approved, but the Cameroonians never signed the project
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>It was a big project, probably $30-40 million in grants and loans over five or
                    six years. The loan part would have covered the construction and commodities
                    elements. The loan element required an additional step or two in the review and
                    approval of the signature package on the Cameroonian side. That slowed things
                    down, but it doesn't seem to explain the Cameroonians' failure to sign.</p>
                <p>My personal view is that it broke down for reasons similar to those that caused a
                    planned Ghana Medical School project to abort in the mid-1960s. A consortium of
                    U.S. medical schools had collaborated in the planning of a medical school and in
                    the design of an AID-financed project to provide a large technical assistance
                    team to help establish and run it. The Ghanaians rejected the project. The
                    Ghanaians went ahead and set up a medical school on their own. Afterwards the
                    leaders who accomplished that freely admitted that they did so because it became
                    clear that they would not be masters in their own house if the planned technical
                    assistance team materialized.</p>
                <p>MEDCAM involved a pretty largsay, six or eight person - project technical team,
                    but I think the main problem for the Cameroonians was that the agreement
                    addressed all the potential problems so thoroughly that it was viewed as
                    invasive by important vested interests in the Ministry. As I recall, the
                    Cameroonians prevailed on us to allow the Central Pharmacy to be the conduit and
                    custodian of the supplies for the Pro-Pharmacies but that we insisted on and got
                    provisions in the agreement that required Pro-Pharmacy supplies to be procured,
                    stored and distributed under a special transparent management structure which
                    amounted to a proto-reform of the wider Central Pharmacy management system. The
                    Central Pharmacy was widely considered to be corrupt and certainly maintained a
                    very cozy arrangement with French pharmaceutical companies from which it
                    procured supplies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the time...or was it after you
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I was there while most of the process preparatory to the signing was
                    underway, but I left a couple of days before the end of the fiscal year. As I
                    recall, we had planned to sign while I was still there, but the ceremony had to
                    be canceled at the last minute because the Cameroonians said they couldn't
                    complete all the approvals required on their side for the loan element of the
                    project. I think that led to a quick decision to defer the loan element and
                    rejigger the project agreement to provide for the grant element but to include
                    language looking forward to loan, other donor or Cameroonian funding of the
                    construction and certain commodities. A new signing was scheduled early on the
                    last day of the fiscal year so that Washington would have all day to deal with
                    the problem if it didn't work out.</p>
                <p>To understand why we would still be uncertain about the second signing ceremony,
                    you have to understand the process for approving a new project agreement on the
                    Cameroonian side. Once we reached agreement with the substantive ministry, the
                    package would go to the Ministry of Economy and Planning. When they were
                    satisfied, it would go to the Prime Minister's Office and from there to the
                    Presidency before going back to the Ministry of Economy and Planning. This
                    process could take a long time. I should have mentioned above under the heading
                    of “What was different” that this process was totally opaque and that our
                    counterparts scrupulously respected that opacity. I would be fascinated to know
                    what penalty they must have feared if they were indiscreet. So once the
                    agreement was revisedespite the shortness of time and even though we had some
                    vague assurances that they meant to move quickly - we had no way of really
                    knowing the extent of the review it would undergo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the Ministry of Health in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, we had gotten their nod before we sent it to the Ministry of
                    Economy and Planning. Also, I forgot to mention that Economy and Planning would
                    also have checked formally with the Ministry of Healtand some other ministries -
                    before sending the package to the Prime Minister's Office.</p>
                <p>Anyway, John Woods went over for the second signing and was told that it would
                    have to be deferred again. John reminded them that there was no way of assuring
                    that the funds could again be made available in the next fiscal year. But there
                    was nothing our counterparts in the Ministry of Economy and Planning could do.

                        move the money somewhere else because, with the end of the fiscal year, we
                        would have lost the money, and there were other people who wanted this
                        health money. And so we kept holding on to it and holding on to it while
                        sending messages to find out if you would be able to commit it. And then
                        being told at the last minute...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I can imagine the frustration. What did you ever do with the five
                    million?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We transferred them to some other program. I don't
                        remember which. There were other candidates lined up, but we really wanted
                        to see MEDCAM go forward. This was a very important project.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT:And I think it was a terrific project. I had the feeling that the guys we
                    were dealing with in the Ministry of Health had genuinely taken ownership of the
                    project. Dr. Atangana was the equivalent of a Secretary General in the Ministry
                    of Health. And the other technical members of his team were pretty high quality
                    people. On the other hand, the minister at that time was a politician who seemed
                    ... well, primitive, even feral. When you walked into his presence you had the
                    feeling that you were almost in danger. I mean, the guy just gave off the most
                    god-awful, nasty vibrations. Nobody had a good word to say about him. He
                    represented some traditional power group in the country and, no doubt, owed his
                    position to that fact. . Q: Was he hostile to outsiders or Americans?</p>
                <p>GILBERT: I don't think it was a matter of feelings. I think the concerns were
                    more material.</p>
                <p>I think we had the feeling that it was a waste of time for us to attempt to
                    handle him. That was Dr. Atangana's role and we had every reason to believe that
                    he was briefing the Minister from time to timat least it was apparent that he
                    was taking occasional cues from someone on the Cameroonian side. If he wasn't
                    going to the Minister, the only other guess would be that he was being guided by
                    his technical colleagues and that they hoped that by maintaining a strong
                    consensus they could get the Minister to go along. Ideally he was doing both. If
                    Atangana was relying on a consensus among the senior technical people to carry
                    the project forward, the Minister may well have felt that he had to appear to go
                    along formally even if he opposed it. I'm sure there were ways he could kill it
                    behind the scenes when it was under review in the Prime Minister's office or the
                    Presidency.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>A few years later, when transiting the Abidjan airport, I bumped into the
                    Cameroonian named Vessa Njoya, who had been the Secretary General of the
                    Ministry of Economy and Planning. He and I had become quite friendly. I asked
                    him to tell me what happened, hoping that he could be frank now that he had left
                    that job. He sort of “crossed his heart and hoped to die” and pledged that he
                    never understood what happened either. That may or may not have been true, but I
                    can imagine that it might be. A Secretary General is roughly equivalent to a
                    Permanent Secretarthe highest civil service position. But there was less of a
                    dividing line between the political and the civil service in Cameroon. Many
                    ministers had been civil servants earlier. But that does not necessarily mean
                    that civil servants were political so much as that development sector Ministers
                    were most often technocrats and largely not privy to the inner workings and
                    political calculations of the Prime Minister's Office and the Presidency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what is your own conclusion about why? Because this is
                        an interesting phenomenon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, the fact that we never got the least whiff of a coherent
                    explanation of the Government's unwillingness to accept the project makes me
                    think that the real explanation was unacceptable. They never offered issues that
                    they wanted us to deal with because they didn't want them fixethey wanted the
                    project to go away. Also, if they had raised the issue that I think bothered
                    them the moswhich was the project's involvement with the Central Pharmacthat
                    would have tipped their hand.</p>
                <p>There may be some lessons to draw from this. One reason I was asked to coordinate
                    the design process was that two of three USAID Cameroon health staff (apart from
                    their boss who supported it) were highly skeptical of the project and tended to
                    drag their feet when asked to help with the design. And they kept telling us
                    that the thrust of the project was just too contrary to the Ministry of Health's
                    ways of doing things. The Health Division Chief just couldn't get their active
                    cooperation. Ray Rifenberg, the Project Development Officer, and I managed to
                    secure a level of teamwork with the other Health Division staffer that allowed
                    us to move forward with the MEDEX representative to complete the design of the
                    project. However, since the reluctant, foot-dragging health staff members were
                    correct in their assessment, it turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory. I conclude
                    thaeven though they couldn't support their argument very well - these guys' gut
                    feeling turned out to be valid. So the lesson I took from this experience was
                    that when you are in a position of authority you can win arguments that you
                    ought to lose, and one needs to guard against that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was their principal objection to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, basically that it was just politically unrealistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that? What was about it that was unrealistic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I think their basic point was that it would disrupt financial flows from
                    corruption and, otherwise, upset too many vested interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. I am with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Another lesson was that one needs to be careful to not design projects
                    that are too good. Maybe we were trying to do too much. Maybe we should have
                    taken a more gradualist approach to our agenda. Then we might have gotten in the
                    door and been able to learn how things really work, including “who's naughty and
                    nice”. Then we could have augmented the project to address realistically a
                    fuller agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A more incremental approach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is interesting. I don't recall any first hand
                        knowledge but my recollection is that it overwhelmed them in a sense. There
                        may have been all these vested interests and they were probably a very
                        significant factor but it was too large an effort to be scaled therefore
                        there was fear that it would dominate the situation so much that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That is similar to the Ghana med school experience. The Cameroonians, a
                    lot of them, may have just concluded that they wouldn't be the masters of their
                    own house anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that incremental approach which is basically slower
                        and doesn't commit large funds would have been wiser.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. One problem was that the nay-saying staff members were quite junior
                    and not particularly known for their wisdom. So their mutterings sounded like
                    negativism and slander. Another was that the MEDEX concept was inherently
                    grandiose and not susceptible to incrementalism. To take an incremental approach
                    would have required telling MEDEX and the Cameroonians that we wanted to cancel
                    the collaborative design of the project. We would have had an awkward time
                    trying to explain to MEDEX, the Cameroonians and AID Washington why we decided
                    to do that. The naysaying didn't start (at least not to my knowledge) until
                    MEDEX was on the scene and at work. Also, if we had gone ahead on a smaller
                    scale without addressing the issue of the Central Pharmacy, I'm pretty sure
                    that, within three years, we would have found ourselves wondering why the
                    project concept was not being realized even though we had spent so much money
                    constructing and equipping various facilities and on training staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's pause there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I remember something else about Cameroon that might be worth discussing.
                    As in other countries we looked for projects that seemed to make sense in terms
                    of the guidance of the day concerning AID priorities. But as far as I can recall
                    we never developed a project without the active encouragement of a Cameroonian
                    agency and, at least, the concurrence of the Ministry of Economy and Planning.
                    However, we quite often got word from Washington that people in the State
                    Department or some visiting Cameroonian had intimated that we were not being
                    responsive to Cameroonian priorities. I don't believe these comments ever came
                    from representatives of Economy and Planning. Instead they came from people who
                    wanted us to finance some activity that would be far outside the AID programming
                    parameters of the time. But when Goler Butcher paid us a visit she apparently
                    remembered this and used a session with the Minister of Economy and Plan to ask
                    him about our responsiveness to their priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was Assistant Administrator, wasn't she?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. She was the Assistant Administrator for Africa. Once I could see
                    where she was heading with her questioning, it made me quite uneasy. Certainly
                    it was true at one level that we were not particularly responsive to their
                    priorities. They might have preferred to have us building new ministry office
                    buildings maybe or doing all sorts of things that we wouldn't find consistent
                    with our precepts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Cameroon government would not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: If they just gave us a list of what they really wanted us to do it
                    probably wouldn't have been very resonant with AID's precepts at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Anyway, Goler asked her question, no doubt mentioninamong projects like
                    MedCam, North Cam Livestock, Mandara Water Resources - some fairly obscure
                    things like an NGO project in the north. After brief reflection, the Minister
                    said, “Well, yes, everything you are doing has a place in our national
                    priorities and as long as other donors are doing the other things on that list
                    and we have enough donors collaborating effectively, our essential needs will be
                    addressed. I thought it was an astute answer. Without giving a quotable quote he
                    was saying, in effect, what you are doing is defensible and useful but not
                    really as responsive as it might be. I think they would rather have had us more
                    involved in infrastructure and industrial development than in the areas smacking
                    of social engineering that attracted our interest. On the other hand, I don't
                    think I remember their ever making a formal request for projects that we
                    couldn't support. They had a very heads up embassy in Washington that tracked
                    aid matters closely. This was something that John Koehring encouraged. He always
                    stopped by and briefed them when he was in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in projects of other countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Central African Empire (CAE)</p>
                <p>GILBERT: I was involved in the projects we had in the Central African Empire
                    (CAE) and Gabon. The main project that I recall really getting underway in CAE,
                    apart from a very large Ambassador's Special Self Help Fund, was Ouaham Province
                    Rural Health. We had other projects on the drawing boards for a time, but our
                    work in the CAE usually proceeded, if at all, in a pretty halting fashion. When
                    I arrived there in 1976, Jean Bedel Bokassa was president. And then, within a
                    few months, he made himself emperor. He was emperor until late 1979 when he was
                    deposed in the somewhat prolonged aftermath of a furor over his role in a
                    massacre of civilians, including school children.</p>
                <p>Strange and shocking things happened in the CAE on a regular basis. Once a
                    British journalist named something like Goldsmith, who had been admitted to an
                    audience with the Emperor, said something that displeased him or was remembered
                    by the Emperor to have said something unflattering earlier. So the emperor
                    whacked him a few times with the scepter or mace that he carried as a symbol of
                    his authority and threw him in the poky. There he stayed for quite a number of
                    weeks while the British, the French, the European Community and the U.S., among
                    others, made repeated demarches to the Emperor. The Emperor finally released him
                    out of benevolent concern for his delicate health, as I recall. As you can
                    imagine, such developments caused AID and other donors to pause and reflect.
                    Even under the best of circumstances things went slowly and uncertainly in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we stop aid at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: And, yes, sometimes we would freeze aid. Abby Fessenden came out in 1978
                    or thereabouts. She was assigned to CAE as resident program officer because it
                    was just too hard for us to do the necessary from Yaounde or to have sufficient
                    coverage by staff on temporary duty (TDY) there. And, even though one could
                    lodge and dine in comfort in Bangui, these TDYs were trying.</p>
                <p>But Abby never took up her assignment. Shortly after she arrived in Yaounde for
                    consultations en route to Bangui, something weird happened and caused AID
                    Washington to instruct her to remain in Yaounde until matters settled down.
                    Well, things didn't improve for a long time. So her assignment was frozen, and
                    she made herself very useful in Yaounde. When her assignment was canceled due to
                    continuing problems in CAE, she was absorbed into our structure in Yaounde. In
                    that capacity she covered CAE, making several TDYs while also helping with USAID
                    Cameroon agriculture sector programming.</p>
                <p>But the Ouaham project was designed and approved before Abby got there, and I had
                    some dealings with it. It was centered in Bossangoa, about two hundred miles
                    north of Bangui. It involved strengthening primary health care services provided
                    through health centers and health posts, including some construction and lots of
                    staff training. Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) were to help by overseeing
                    improvements to health facilities and, perhaps, conducting some health education
                    work at schools. This was the first project I ever saw that involved close
                    cooperation with the Peace Corps. It was a rocky owing in part to the PCVs.</p>
                <p>The problem occurred because of the difficulty of getting the various components
                    of the project to come on stream at the same time. The PCVs arrived some time
                    before the earliest of two planned AID technicians, one a Health Education
                    Specialist and the other a Public Health Physician. The former arrived first.
                    When the PCVs arrived someone from USAID Cameroon and Karen Woodbury, the CAE
                    Peace Corps Director, agreed that the PCVs would receive some training and a
                    certain amount of money so they could get started with certain basic tasks
                    envisioned in the project plan. I think one activity was latrine construction
                    and another may have been teaching of basic environmental hygiene to school
                    kids.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>Well, when the Health Educator arrived he had a pretty complete understanding of
                    the full technical thrust of the AID project. Meanwhile, the PCVs had been at
                    work for some time. Notwithstanding their rather narrow mandate, they had formed
                    their own ideas of what the project should be about, and these were not
                    particularly consistent with the Health Educator's ideas or the project design.
                    Of course the PCVs (this being the late 1970s an all) didn't particularly see
                    why they should listen to this guy who was a newcomer, was over thirty and even
                    had, gasp, a certain amount of gray hair! There was kind of a Mexican stand off
                    and some turmoil during which I don't recall the Peace Corps Office in Bangui
                    being very helpful. But the Health Educator (I believe his name was Jack Finlay)
                    listened to and reasoned with the PCVS, gradually established a working
                    consensus with them and was able to get them working along lines generally
                    consistent with the original project plan. He and they had rightly come to
                    appreciate that some of the priorities and activities in the plan needed to be
                    adjusted. One of these was that school latrines were a waste of money because
                    the kids couldn't be persuaded to use them owing to some cultural thing, perhaps
                    a taboo.</p>
                <p>Just when things were starting to get moving again, the Public Health Physician,
                    who of course had to be the Team Leader, arrived on the scene. When he found
                    that the PCVs and Jack were moving forward without him and not doing everything
                    completely in accordance with his preconceptions, he went off the deep end,
                    Captain Queeg style. He was an internist from a major urban hospital (with
                    public health experience and credentials) who had decided to abandon the
                    professional fast track for humanitarian reasons. Rather than reason and cajole
                    and maybe even concede a point here and there to Jack and the PCVs, he rigidly
                    stood on his authority and began ordering everyone who disagreed with him off
                    the project. Our partners in the CAE Ministry of Health were totally flummoxed,
                    and AID was looking terrible. We tried to get the Team Leader to loosen up and
                    enter into a give-and-take-dialogue, but we just got longer and shriller
                    messages back in answer to each of ours. Finally, our Health Officer and I (as
                    Acting Director during most of 1968) went to Bangui together to assess the
                    situation. It became clear to us, and the concerned CAE health officials, that
                    we could have him and no one else (a chief and no Indians) or we could rely on
                    Findlay and the PCVs to accomplish much of what we had planned. So we took that
                    course. It wasn't pleasant. The Team Leader had something of a messiah complex
                    and saw our action as analogous to a couple of pettifogging bureaucrats
                    presuming to go to Lambar�n� to fire Albert Schweitzer.</p>
                <p>A lesson I drew from this experience was that a critical mass of technical team
                    members, or at least the Team Leader, needs to arrive first on the job. Failing
                    this, that any lower level team members must be prevented from getting too far
                    out in front. In particular, if you are going to do a project with the Peace
                    Corps, make sure the AID project framework gets put in place before Peace Corps
                    volunteers show up.</p>

                <p>The other significant project in CAE concerned drilling wells as well as
                    installing and repairing pumps. It was a really nice project, conceived, I
                    believe, by John Koehring. We did it on kind of a pick-up or sandlot basis.
                    After one of the periodic evacuations of PCVs due to political ructions in Chad,
                    we sounded out key members of a well drilling team and found that they would be
                    interested in doing the same thing on a contract basis. So we contracted with
                    them and also bought two well drilling rigs; pipes, pumps and pump spare parts;
                    and camping equipment. Something like a hundred sites had been identified where
                    new wells were needed or where some kind of rehabilitation was called for. I
                    think there were about five or six guys on a team and a few others who operated
                    a logistics base and office. These guys loved their work and were happy to spend
                    weeks on end at their worksites in the bush. There was supposed to be a
                    committee and a well attendant in each village responsible for seeing that
                    people paid for the upkeep of the pumps, that the pumps weren't damaged (kids
                    liked to swing on the handles, etc.) and that maintenance was carried out
                    regularly. I think there were a few counterpart Central Africans that worked on
                    the project with them, but developing institutional capacity in the government
                    to continue the work was the weak spot in the project. On the other hand,
                    donors' talking about sustainability in the CAE was like Linus' talking about
                    the Great Pumpkin. The government was too poor to sustain much of anything so
                    sustainability had to be redefined as applying to the community level. Sometimes
                    sustainability of a sort was achieved by donors' picking up where one another
                    left off in various sub-sectors and geographic areas.</p>
                <p>I think most of us departed for our TDYs in Bangui with a sense of adventure, if
                    not trepidation. One thing that happened from time to time, but all of us hoped
                    to avoid, was that the Emperor would hear about some visitor and, if his
                    curiosity was pricked, convoke him or her. Most of the time it was just an
                    interesting experience, but sometimes it could take an unhappy turn. I mentioned
                    earlier the case of the British reporter, Goldsmith. Another example concerned
                    the American DCM. He once got convoked and was effectively shanghaied for a
                    couple of days. In the midst of an audience with the Emperor, it was suddenly
                    decided that “everyone” would hie off to a hunting reserve in the eastern part
                    of the country. According to the rigid protocol in the emperor's court, there
                    was no departing the exalted presence without being excused. Rather than being
                    excused, he was “convoked” to go along. I can't vouch for this story, but it was
                    told to me with a straight face, and it was not implausible.</p>
                <p>It was difficult to get to Bangui. There was only one flight that departed from
                    Yaounde. That involved going by way of Brazzaville, and its frequency was such
                    that it was impossible to stay in Bangui for less than a week. So most of us
                    went to Bangui on the emperor's champagne flight. The emperor had a personal
                    Caravel that made a twice weekly trip to Douala to pick up supplies for the
                    emperor's court. These usually included at least a pallet of cases of champagne.
                    The plane was partitioned. On one side sat the passengers and on the other side
                    was the freight. But the partition was canvass and you could see all the
                    pallets.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>The Cameroon Airlines (CamAir) flight to Douala got in the late morning and the
                    Caravel left at something like 4 PM. One normally made a courtesy call at the
                    U.S. Consulate and then went to lunch at a pleasant little restaurant nearby
                    called Chez Christophe. Once when I was sitting there having lunch I noticed a
                    jolly, loudish party of people at the bar, but I didn't think too much of it.
                    Among them was a short, pudgy, blond Frenchman who had kind of a dissipated look
                    about him and, together with the others, seemed to be throwing back a few drinks
                    at the bar. That evening, as we were flying to Bangui on the Emperor's Caravel
                    (converted to a Central African Airways flight for the occasion), we went
                    through some very bumpy weather. I was pretty tense. One reason was that the
                    plane seemed to be overloaded. It had seemed to be straining from the moment it
                    took off. Another thing that worried me was that the two stewardesses, who
                    looked familiar to me, seemed agitated and distraught. What was eating
                    them?!</p>
                <p>We obviously made it to Bangui. As we got off, who should I see but the little
                    blond Frenchman wearing a Captain's uniform and walking away with his co-pilot
                    who also looked familiar. This guy and the other members of the flight crew had
                    been drinking in this bar and restaurant only about six or seven hours
                    previously and our flight had lasted at least two hours. I think the
                    stewardesses were a little hung over and feeling both guilt and fear. I have to
                    grant that it is just possible that some or all had been drinking nonalcoholic
                    beverages, but I am virtually certain that was not the case. And even if they
                    weren't, allowing it to appear that they were drinking was nearly as scandalous
                    as the reality could be.</p>
                <p>Before I left Yaounde Bokassa was overthrown and went into exile in Abidjan. The
                    country became the Central African Republic once again. Before we leave the CAR,
                    I would like to add a couple of postscripts. One is that I was struck by how
                    competent and dedicated some of that country's health sector public servants
                    were. They compared favorably with their counterparts in Cameroon technically
                    and I thought that that they deserved a lot of credit for their willingness to
                    serve their country despite all the cards stacked against them during Bokassa's
                    excesses. Their skills and earning power gave them the option of being outside
                    the country earning decent incomes. I had the feeling that the ones that I knew
                    were doing what they could despite a lot of corruption and craziness all round
                    them. With the connivance of the Director of Rural Health (approximate title) we
                    hid the Ouham project vehicles that were kept in Bangui to prevent their being
                    commandeered by higher ups in the Ministry of Health or other ministries. A
                    picaresque novel titled Malaria Dreams is both highly entertaining and accurate
                    in depicting the CAR, including Bangui, as well as Chad, Northern Nigeria and
                    Niger. The man who wrote it obviously had experience in that part of the
                    world.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Gabon</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>GILBERT: In about 1974 Congress wrote into the AID legislation a grant of five
                    million dollars to the Schweitzer Hospital at Lambarene. I definitely recall
                    making two trips to Lambarene. One was to just go and see if everything was as
                    it should be.Later I was invited to the dedication of a new wing of the hospital
                    that had been put up using AID as well as other donor funds. And so I went down
                    to attend that with Art Tinken, the American Ambassador in Libreville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the hospital complex there and
                        the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it had been modernized somewhat through improvement of plumbing
                    and the addition of electricity, but was still very simple, rustically colonial
                    and, I suspect, outwardly little changed since Schweitzer's day. Schweitzer's
                    idea had been to make it open and welcoming to the African populations of the
                    surrounding forest region. And some of the things I had read about were still
                    true. Families would come and camp at the hospital. The families continued to
                    feed the patients. I'm sure they did a lot of good, but it was still on a pretty
                    small scale. With hindsight, it ought to have been interesting to health
                    professionals as an appropriate technology application and have been evaluated
                    by them on those terms, but I saw no indication of that. It seemed to draw harsh
                    criticism from one group who saw it as somehow racist because it made no effort
                    to be as antiseptically and technologically apart from its surroundings as their
                    precepts required a hospital to be and by another group who were wed to the idea
                    that health care should rest on a pyramid of decentralized health posts and
                    health centers topped by hospitals providing the senior professional support to
                    satellite, subordinate facilities and caring for the most difficult cases. But
                    Lambarene didn't fit either precept and probably could not do so owing to the
                    sparseness of the population of that part of Gabon. The country had fewer than a
                    million people and most of those lived in the larger cities and towns. Lambarene
                    is in a really remote part of the country. When one flies to it, you see very
                    few roads and clearings. This characteristic is very striking when you fly over
                    in a single engine aircraft with a pilot who looks to be about 16 as I did the
                    first time I went there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they doing any kind of public health work as opposed
                        to curative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Not that I could perceive. I think I heard about health education of
                    people that came there for childbirth and that sort of thing. And I seem to
                    recall that they had responded to the current doctrine of the hospital as the
                    hub of a decentralized system to the extent of doing some outreach close to the
                    hospital, but they didn't have a lot of staff and the surrounding region was
                    vast. There was a Swiss medical team there when I visited and there were
                    probably a majority of African nurses, but I don't believe there were any
                    Gabonese doctors. I believe I was told they couldn't recruit Gabonese doctors to
                    work there, and that's completely plausible.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>Gabonese capable of doing any work in the modern sector were rare (and rumored to
                    be impossibly lazy). When I was going to Gabon there was a very large
                    Cameroonian immigrant or guest worker population. Libreville was the only place
                    in Africa where I ever saw Europeans doing unskilled manual labor. A Yugoslav
                    construction company carrying out widening of city streets had brought in
                    Yugoslav ditch diggers, and no one I talked to criticized them for it. This
                    reflected not just a labor shortage, but also a kind of a Gulf state-type of
                    phenomenon. Gabonese citizens were in such great demand as partners in, and
                    front men for, foreign-owned businesses that many developed a sense of
                    entitlement to being paid “for their good looks,” so to speak.</p>
                <p>But even if the Schweitzer Hospital was understandable in all its peculiarity,
                    the U.S. grant was a good example of the kind of silliness that comes of
                    Congressional riders getting tacked onto AID legislation. There was no
                    significant wider impact to our investment. Viewed as a pilot project, the
                    Lambar�n� approach would not be applicable except in the highly unique
                    conditions found in Gabon, and I suppose that's why no one proposed evaluating
                    its cost-effectiveness. Moreover, I don't really think that our money was much
                    needed. The nostalgia and mystique of the place was sufficient to guarantee that
                    they would receive “feel good” contributions from Europe adequate to continue
                    their core work.</p>

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Do you remember Macias, the dictator who had something like a hundred
                    political opponents executed in a stadium to the strains of “Those Were the
                    Times, My Friend.” a tune from the movie Zorba, the Greek? Well, that was just
                    the tip of the iceberg because tens of thousands of ordinary people died under
                    his rule apart from that. He was overthrown and executed in 1979. State and AID
                    Washington decided that some kind of program was required there and we were
                    asked to send an assessment and planning team to explore options. Our senior
                    Project Development Officer, Ray Riffenberg, had come out of the Latin America
                    Bureau and spoke fluent Spanish. He, as well as members of health and
                    agriculture staffs, carried out the assessment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the first time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, but I can't remember what came out of it. Well, maybe I remember
                    something. I think that we probably ran a rather large Ambassador's Special
                    Self-Help Fund with modified rules that allowed us to spend largish amounts on
                    sub-activities such as, say, $50,000 to rehabilitate agriculture training school
                    buildings and health posts, etc. I gather Equatorial Guinea was pretty bleamore
                    so than CAR. And I thought CAR was the most untouched part of Africa that I had
                    ever seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I can actually only describe Ouham Province. It seemed to have an
                    overwhelmingly subsistence economy. There were villages, but they had little in
                    the way of infrastructure, and I don't believe Bossangoa had electricity apart
                    from a few open-air bistros that had gasoline- or diesel-powered generators. As
                    in most of the Francophone countries that I knew, there were very few paved
                    roads, but the unpaved roads were pretty well maintained. You could drive
                    between 50 and 60 mph on straight stretches between villages. There was no
                    commercial development. Unlike villages in Ghana, Nigeria or Cameroon, there
                    were no Coca Cola, Fanta or beer signs. The markets mostly sold local food
                    stuffs plus a few tins of sardines, cheap razor blades and, maybe, some flash
                    lights and batteries. Otherwise you had the feeling that you were in a kind of a
                    pristine setting. For example, most people lived in houses with adobe walls and
                    thatched roofs. There were very few schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is an area where we had what projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: A health project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That pretty well covers that assignment. That is very
                        interesting. Well, then you went back to the Sahel Development Program after
                        that.</hi>

                <p>GILBERT: Yes, but since we talked about that out of sequence so as to consolidate
                    the treatment of my two stints in the Sahel office, we've reached the point
                    where I was assigned to Tanzania in the fall of 1983. I was assigned there as
                    Deputy Director. It was not a happy period in my career because I was thoroughly
                    on the outs with the AA/AFR, and he had been feeding a lot of negative material
                    about me into the executive personnel management network. As a result, he was
                    able to inform me with a note of triumph that I had two options: to be AID
                    Representative in Cape Verde or Deputy Director in Tanzania. I chose Tanzania
                    because I was interested in East Africa and Tanzania, in particular. I doubt
                    that I would have had those options were it not for the fact that the AA/AFR had
                    thoroughly alienated the A/AID and others. But I was really quite bitter as well
                    as physically and psychologically tired as I left AFR/SWA. My bitterness was
                    only slightly assuaged when I learned that my tormentor's own options were so
                    limited that he accepted an assignment as Ambassador to Equatorial Guinea. I
                    believe he remained there for all the remaining years of the Reagan
                    administration.</p>
                <p>Within about six weeks of our arrival in Tanzania, the Mission Director, who was
                    Art Handly, was transferred to Cairo as Deputy Director. Soon after he left, we
                    learned that Handly would not be replaced and that I would be holding the fort
                    for the indefinite future as Acting Director. This was because Tanzania was on
                    the verge of falling under the terms of the Brooke Amendment whereby assistance
                    must be suspended when a country has fallen more than a year behind in repaying
                    debts owed to the U.S. Government. I was told that I should move into the
                    Mission Director's residence, an old, charming, colonial house that AID owned
                    and wanted to hang on to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some political reason why Handly wasn't being
                        replaced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe it was partly meant to downgrade our level of representation
                    and symbolize to the Tanzanians that the aid-relationship with the U.S. was on
                    the down slope. The explicit, pragmatic and valid reason was that, with no early
                    prospect for resumed programming of new assistance, it simply made no sense to
                    maintain a person of Handly's seniority and experience as manager of the
                    Tanzania program.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>But before I go on I have to give you some background to what happened during my
                    time in Tanzania. The Reagan State Department nursed a considerable grudge
                    toward the Tanzanian Government. Lurking in the collective memory was a picture
                    of Foreign Minister Salim Salim, then Ambassador to the U.N., jigging in the
                    aisle at the U.N. General Assembly session that admitted China to the U.N.
                    despite strenuous U.S. opposition. George Bush was U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
                    at that time. But their sins had continued and multiplied because they disagreed
                    with the U.S. on lots of sensitive cold war issues, they were extremely active
                    and influential within the nonaligned movement and they reputedly had the most
                    effective foreign ministry and diplomatic service in Africa. If the White House'
                    and State's idea of a good African partner was Zaire's Mobuto Sese Seko, imagine
                    how obnoxious Tanzania's Julius Nyerere had to be to them. He was a dedicated
                    and obstinate African (non-Marxist) socialist whose policies were driving his
                    own country's economy into the ground, but Tanzania had a reasonable human
                    rights record despite its one-party political system. While there was corruption
                    in Tanzania, no taint of corruption ever touched Nyerere. Tanzania was an active
                    Front Line state in the struggle with the apartheid regime in the Republic of
                    South Africa (RSA). Tanzania harbored representatives, and even military bases,
                    of the African National Congress (ANC), Sam Nujoma's Southwest Africa People's
                    Organization (SWAPO) and others, including fairly radical South African group
                    whose name included “Pan-African” in it. They maintained cooperative relations
                    with East Germany (getting technical assistance with internal security). They
                    hosted North Korean, Albanian and, I'm pretty sure, Cuban Embassies. Yet they
                    were fiercely independent and completely in control of their government and
                    territory. And the country was largely free of tribalism. As far as I could
                    tell, the only group of any heft in national politics that was viewed with
                    trepidation by the largely detribalized majority was the Chaga who lived around
                    Moshi and on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro. The Tanzanians relentlessly
                    opposed and occasionally thwarted U.S. foreign policy on many issues. As far as
                    I could see, they got no credit for responding to Idi Amin's aggression against
                    them by invading Uganda and kicking him out. To me, given the horror with which
                    the U.S. and the West viewed the Amin regime, this showed that as of 1983 the
                    U.S. was making little effort to be unbiased in its approach to Tanzania.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>However, during the 1970s Tanzania had been an emphasis country and received very
                    large amounts of U.S. assistance. As AID's concern about economic policy
                    frameworks increased and as the economic toll taken by the Uganda war dramatized
                    that the Tanzanian economy had become nearly inoperative, AID levels began
                    during the early 1980s to decline as AID - in coordination with the World Bank
                    and the IMF - tried to get the Tanzanians to realize that their African
                    Socialist policies were failing and to see the value of abandoning the regime of
                    administered prices and other controls on the economy. Various studies were
                    carried out and discussed with Tanzanian technocrats, especially a man named
                    Simon Mbalini (phonetic spelling), who was, I believe, called something like
                    Chief Economist in the Ministry of Agriculture. For some time the Tanzanians and
                    the donors had been engaged in a kind of dance wherein the Tanzanians paid just
                    enough to stay out of “Brooke status” while talking economic policy reform and
                    seeking debt rescheduling while the donors, for their part, periodically
                    rescheduled debt payments and continued to provide new assistance in smaller and
                    smaller amounts. Meanwhile, the Tanzanians continued to receive large amounts of
                    assistance from the Nordic donors who expressed little concern about the policy
                    framework. When the Tanzanians finally ceased payments, it was viewed within AID
                    as a kind of message that they had no intention of trying to reach an
                    accommodation with the U.S. and the World Bank on economic policy and aid
                    issues. This, no doubt, contributed to the decision to move Art Handly out.</p>
                <p>When we arrived, the Ambassador was David Miller. He was frank, but also
                    engaging, outgoing and irrepressibly constructive in his approach to the
                    Tanzanians. He was replaced sometime in 1984 by a very senior career USIA
                    officer who had served as Counselor of that agency and earned the Reagan
                    Administration's gratitude for his skill in limiting the amount of trouble their
                    appointee landed in as a result of his strange antics. I have never seen an
                    Ambassador take up his duties in such a peevish frame of mind. At out first
                    meeting he let me know, with a meaningful glower, that he and the AID Assistant
                    Administrator for Africa (by then in Spanish language training preparatory to
                    his new role in Equatorial Guinea), with whom I and others had had so much
                    trouble, were personal friends.</p>
                <p>By the time he arrived, Tanzania was firmly ineligible to receive further U.S.
                    assistance because they were in “Brooke status.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This meant no new AID funding?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That's right. For some time Tanzania had been slipping in and out of
                    Brooke in the course of the “dance” with the donors that I mentioned earlier.
                    But by late 1983 it had become clear to them that the amount of U.S. assistance
                    that they would get by remaining out of Brooke would not be amount to much
                    unless they also undertook economic policy reforms well beyond what they were
                    prepared to contemplate just then.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is at the point in time when AID's development policy
                        strategy had moved away from the poor majority and basic needs? What was the
                        environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, there is a tendency to think that the shift toward renewed concern
                    with economic growth and economic policy frameworks came with the Reagan
                    administration, but I like to remind people that it really started towards the
                    end of the Carter administration. One factor in the shift was the study that
                    Elliot Berg led for the World Bank. The realization that we had been neglecting
                    the important question of whether policy frameworks were adequate to promote
                    development was spreading rapidly before Carter left office, and a movement to
                    increase the number of economists in AID, and to make better use of who
                    remained, was well underway in 1980. It had gathered a great deal of momentum by
                    1983. For example, the Tanzania Mission had two program economists until Joe
                    Goodman departed a few weeks before I got there.</p>
                <p>And I think it would be fair to say that in 1982-83 the U.S. was out in front of
                    the other donors. Definitely that was the case compared to other bilateral
                    donors in Tanzania. And, you know, I couldn't help wondering if that weren't one
                    of the reasons that they allowed themselves to go into Brooke. They may have
                    hoped we would decamp or go silent, thus posing less of a “bad example” to the
                    other donors.</p>
                <p>One of the first meetings I remember attending was with Cleopas Msuya, the
                    Finance Minister. He treated us to a discourse that he had obviously perfected
                    on earlier occasions. He traced the intellectual history of Tanzania's
                    development strategies all the way back to independence and made a pretty
                    convincing case that all their major mistakes had resulted from going along with
                    donor ideas and priorities. Neither he nor Mbalini made any pretense at all that
                    the current policies were anything but bankrupt. Both men took the position that
                    they were working to build a consensus for change, and that the donors needed to
                    be a little more patient and a little less self-righteous. They rightly pointed
                    out that it is not all that easy to climb down once you get way up a tree and
                    out on a branch that is sagging under your weight.</p>
                <p>The Tanzanians had some very good people. For instance, Simon Mbalini was an
                    economist who had spent years in the United States and earned a Ph.D. there. He
                    had worked for a firm that traded on one of the commodities exchanges. This guy
                    understood how markets worked and he believed in them. But neither he nor Msuya
                    could act on his own. The challenge they faced was to bring a lot of very
                    stubborn people with strong vested interests in the status quo around to a new
                    policy consensus.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>As Chief Program Economist, Joe Goodwioften working with a consultant named Dick
                    Neuburg - had generated some useful studies dealing with a variety of economic
                    policy issues. These had been circulated among the donors and concerned
                    Tanzanian bodies, including key people like Simon Mbalini. And sometimes his
                    comment would be “Yes, this is close to the mark.” At other times, he and others
                    would offer some rather professional criticisms of the data, analysis or the
                    methodology used. Though there was a real policy dialogue at that level, I
                    wouldn't, and didn't then, argue that it was going anywhere much.</p>
                <p>Well, once they got firmly into Brooke, our initial focus was on our substantial
                    pipeline. It would carry the remaining projects for two or more years in most
                    cases. Also, we had a certain amount of U.S.-use local currency and a lot of
                    counterpart local currency from earlier PL 480 Title I programs and, possibly, a
                    Commodity Import Program. So we thought we would make some tactical
                    changeincluding maximizing the use of local currency - and implement our
                    projects on a revised timetable, hoping in the meanwhile that Tanzania would get
                    out of Brooke and become eligible for new funding.</p>
                <p>But then we became aware of a provision in the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) that
                    provided funding to prevent leaving unusable, unfinished investments (i.e.,
                    “white elephants”) behind when circumstances, including the Brooke Amendment,
                    required closure of AID programs. So with a nod from Washington and help from
                    Satish Shah, who was then a REDSO/ESA project design officer, we prepared
                    amendments to all of our ongoing projects so that the existing pipeline combined
                    with counterpart currency programmed by the GOT and - as necessary - these
                    supplementary funds would see the projects to useful, though
                    earlier-than-scheduled, conclusions. We did this fairly quickly because there
                    was a pretty stringent time limit on the availability of the above mentioned
                    supplementary phase-out funds.</p>
                <p>We did this with the initial guidance and full knowledge throughout oWashington.
                    However, we did so under our delegation of authority, which permitted us to
                    approve the amended projects provided we had legal concurrence and followed
                    certain technical guidance from REDSO. We were scrupulous in observing the terms
                    of our delegation. Once the amended project papers were completed, we prepared
                    draft project agreement amendments and Congressional Notifications (CNs). This
                    was a very complicated and intense process because we also had to work
                    simultaneously with our Tanzanian counterparts on each project and also with the
                    unit that programmed counterpart currencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>But once we had completed these steps, and - most importantllearned that the CNs
                    had been cleared by all concerned in AID/W and sent to the Hill, we breathed a
                    sigh of relief and scheduled a signing ceremony. It turned out that, in view of
                    the number of projects involved, the Minister of Finance decided to sign for the
                    GOT. I'm sure I offered to have the Ambassador also sign, but I believe it was
                    decided that I would sign alone. Of course, in the best AID tradition, the
                    signing date was either the last or the next to the last possible day. This was
                    not the end of the fiscal year, but the end of the deadline specified in the FAA
                    for using the supplemental funds.Late on the night before the signing, I got a
                    call and a NIAC cable to the effect that the Hill had questioned the CN and that
                    hasty negotiations had produced a scaled-back allocation of the supplemental
                    funds considerably below the planned amount.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>Accordingly, the amended project agreements that we had sent over for the
                    Government to review were no longer valid. Still we needed to obligate the
                    smaller amount of funds within the deadline. Thank heavens, Washington said they
                    would work on the modalities of the obligation and give us guidance by opening
                    of business. The signing was scheduled for something like 9 AM. The next
                    morning, I couldn't reach anyone at the Ministry of Finance by phone at the
                    normal opening hour. So, after an exceptionally early huddle with my senior
                    colleagues to explain our problem and get them working on how to divide up the
                    smaller amount of funding among our five or six continuing projects, I went over
                    to break the news to the Tanzanians at a little after 8 AM. Brushing past some
                    media folks who were getting ready to cover the event, I found a senior civil
                    servant named Makenya and explained the problem to him. He left me to go and
                    explain it the Minister. Makenya returned with word that he would work with us
                    during the day to arrive at an agreement that he would make sure received the
                    Minister's signature within the necessary timeframe. Walking back to my car with
                    Makenya, we encountered the Minister. I stopped to say how sorry I was for this
                    turn of events, offering to shake hands at the outset. He looked right through
                    me and kept walking. That may have been salutary since Makenya felt terrible
                    about it and may, as a result, have tried a bit harder to be helpful during the
                    remainder of the day. That day we sort of bonded, and I came to appreciate him a
                    great deal. Neither the Minister of Finance nor Mbalini of Agriculture ever met
                    with me or communicated informally with me again. Thanks to excellent work by my
                    colleagues, quick understanding and good cooperation on Makenya's part and
                    excellent support from the legal staffs in REDSO and Washington and the
                    Washington desk, we managed to obligate our supplemental funding. That meant
                    that we would be completing five projects over periods of roughly 30 to 36
                    months per project using supplemental, pipeline and counterpart funds. It also
                    meant that we accelerated wrap-up of five or six other projects that had been
                    scheduled to run through FY 1985 using previously obligated funds. Another
                    crisis had to do with the Operating Expenses (OE) budget. Even though the number
                    of our U.S. staff positions had been pared down, we still had substantial U.S.
                    staff and national staff and lots of administrative and logistics expenses. We
                    had a large logistics base in Dar and little had been done to pare it down. Our
                    room for maneuver was limited by the fact that AID owned real estate in Dar and
                    in Arusha, and there were legal requirements governing how we managed such
                    property. For the first few months that I was there, our OE budget seemed
                    sufficient. But the rate of inflation increased, and it became clear that we
                    were headed for trouble. When we asked for an adjustment in our OE level, we got
                    no reply except a lower quarterly allocation than we had anticipated. This was
                    alarming, because we risked being unable to pay our bills. So I personally sent
                    a cable and, getting no response, another and still another. I tried to reach
                    the concerned people on the phone with no success. Then the Controller and the
                    Executive Officer came to me and said they were getting feedback through their
                    channels that we weren't going to get more funding, that I was making “people”
                    angry and that they wanted me to shut up and for us to live with whatever we got
                    — which wasn't likely to be even what we had been led to expect because others
                    wanted it for expanding programs. And anyway, what were we still doing in
                    Tanzania? Didn't we understand that we were expected to disappear?</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Just about then, the Tanzanians saved us by devaluing their currency by a
                    substantial amounsomething like 40%. After the briefest imaginable sigh of
                    relief, my colleagues and I realized that we would still wind up in trouble
                    unless we soon reached an understanding with AID/W on how we were going to
                    manage the Tanzania program under the new circumstances. We had noticed somewhat
                    belatedly (interestingly, I don't think anyone in Washington or REDSO prompted
                    us on this) that there was actually a section in the Handbooks on what to do
                    when circumstances require a significant scaling back or termination of an AID
                    program. It called for the Mission to prepare a plan for approval by
                    AID/Washington. So I wrote a cable to Washington pointing out, inter alia, that
                    we would be doing this and saying when we would submit it. I can't remember for
                    sure, but the inter alia part probably included some admonitions to the effect
                    that we needed to reach an stable understanding on what we were expected to do
                    in terms of program and property management, rather than continuing to have
                    revisionist skirmishes over OE and other issues at every step of the way. I was
                    really steamed, and all this garbagcoming on the heels of my experiences with
                    the Sahel Program - was taking a significant emotional toll on me. I was
                    beginning to feel like a fall guy, and I didn't much care what anybody thought
                    about my unhappiness with the way things had been going. We said that we would
                    submit our phase-down plan in early summer of 1984 to be reviewed as part of the
                    Annual Budget Submission process, which for us would be mainly about the OE
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were being confronted by high inflation rates and
                        your costs were going way up...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: High inflation was throwing off the cost estimates on which the OE
                    budget had been based, and, finally, devaluation saved us. Before that, while we
                    were twisting in the wind, nobody ever gave us serious, workable advice or
                    guidance on how we should deal with the situation we were in. Al Ford was the
                    Desk Officer. Ed Spriggs was the East Africa and Southern Africa Office Director
                    and Brian Kline was the Officer-in-Charge for some other countries, including
                    Tanzania. These guys would talk to us on the phone and try to be helpful, but
                    they couldn't get decisions or directions out of anybody about Tanzania. They
                    agreed that the phase-down plan was the right solution. But I'm sure we never
                    got a cable responding to mine on our intent to do a phase-down plan. I figured
                    that this was all the more reason to plow ahead, and that's what we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>We had a Population Officer named Spence Silverstein in the Mission. He was
                    waiting to hear about an early transfer given that his projects were among those
                    that we decided not to pursue. Not having much to do, he readily agreed to take
                    on the task of coordinating the phase-down plan. He produced a very respectable
                    product. It involved phasing-down to a minimal level consistent with maintaining
                    an AID presence on the grounds that Tanzania would continue to be eligible to
                    receive food aid and funding for NGO programs in Tanzania. Given that Tanzania
                    suffered from chronic and transitory food insecurity, we felt it made sense to
                    maintain a small office in Dar to oversee food aid and NGO activity. We were
                    also assuming that there had to be a “turnaround” before long and that, when
                    that happened, AID would be required to launch a new program in Tanzania. The
                    administrative management folks in Washingtoespecially Ann Dotherow and Carol
                    McGraw - were very supportive of us and wanted to avoid premature disposal of
                    AID-owned and choicer leased property. These properties had been rewired,
                    equipped with safe havens and otherwise improved to make them secure and
                    comfortable for American families. Dotherow and McGraw knew from sad previous
                    experience that the Agency would pay dearly in the future for inferior premises
                    when the inevitable reinstatement of an AID presence occurred.</p>
                <p>I hand delivered the phase-down plan on schedule when passing through Washington
                    en route to Minnesota for R and R. Among the meetings I had was one with the man
                    who succeeded Ray Love as Senior DAA. After a few pretty stiff pleasantries, I
                    said something like, “Well, I have the phase-down plan, and I'll be delivering
                    it to AFR/ESA unless you wish someone else to coordinate the necessary review.”
                    Brian Kline was there with me, and we had agreed that we wanted guidance on that
                    point. And the Senior DAwhom I had always admired - said, “Fritz, we don't care
                    about this phase-down plan. We don't want to discuss it; we want you to just
                    close everything down out there. When that's done we'll see that you get a good
                    onward assignment.” That is almost a verbatim quote.</p>
                <p>I think I must have been paranoid enough by then to have half anticipated the
                    possibility of such a reaction because I suddenly heard myself saying that it
                    would be both illegal and irresponsible to do that except on the basis of
                    written instructions from Washington and, “if that's what you want, you need to
                    get yourself another boy.” There was a longish silence. Brian looked like he was
                    doing long division in his head. I was livid and so adrenalized I was twitchy.
                    Finally, the Senior DAA said, “Okay, ... all right, we'll review this thing and
                    respond to it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>A couple of weeks later I returned to Washington for the review. Larry Saiers,
                    who, at that point, may have been one of the DAAs, but had yet to become the
                    Senior DAA, chaired it. Our plan was pretty well received. However, we were told
                    that it didn't go far enough. They provisionally accepted our plan for phasing
                    down the U.S. and national staffs as the program declined, but wanted the plan
                    to culminate in phase-out after a brief period when the Executive Officer
                    completed the wind up all AID's legal and administrative affairs. They also
                    assigned Ann Dotherow and Jim McCabe to come out on TDY and participate in
                    putting these changes into the final document. When they came out, they caught a
                    few, mainly property management, issues that had escaped us and improved our
                    document without really changing its thrust or accelerating its timing. If
                    anything, they made the phase-down process a bit more deliberate than we
                    proposed. The final plan was formally approved, and we had no significant
                    trouble after that with OE budget issues. I believe that phase-out was slated to
                    occur at the end of FY 1987.</p>
                <p>And so, with a gradually dwindling team of about 14 U.S. direct hires and about
                    60 nationals, I was there for another two years implementing five projects and
                    the phase-out plan. It was really quite a management challenge. We couldn't
                    allow project implementation to slide because that would cause the other
                    elements of the phase-out to slide as well. Because I had argued against making
                    the plan's final scenario (at the outset, at least) phase-out rather than
                    phase-down, some folks in Washington suspected my commitment to the plan. Our
                    credibility was therefore really, really on the line. But in addition to
                    managing the program, we had major gyrations to go through in the management of
                    our administrative and logistics structure. Because of our strong belie(which
                    turned out to be entirely correct) that a turnaround would prevent AID's
                    departure, we and the pragmatists in Washington agreed that we needed to get rid
                    first of our least desirable leases and retreat last of all to the properties
                    that AID owned. We also were required to give the Embassy the first refusal on
                    properties that we shed. As our projects ended we could get rid of U.S. staff.
                    This, in turn, permitted us to reduce our housing and vehicle pools as well as
                    the related logistics base. As these shrank, we went through six-monthly rounds
                    of national staff reductions.</p>
                <p>One of our toughest challenges was to maintain national staff loyalty and
                    motivation. Part of our response was to develop an outplacement program and a
                    system of performance awards to enhance the severance package that good
                    employees could expect on departure. Another part was to be scrupulous in
                    eliminating functions rather than targeting individuals for reduction. We
                    classified all of our jobs and employees, and, within each job classification
                    and grade, we dismissed the lower grade and last hired employees first.</p>
                <p>It was not a lot of fun but I learned a lot. The program was varied and
                    interesting. Our counterparts were interesting and serious people, except for
                    one really foul ball in the Ministry of Health. And, best of all, I got to know
                    Tanzania. Oh, and I almost forgot! We wound up being involved in a multi-donor
                    policy dialogue with the Tanzanians that culminated in a turnaround a few months
                    after I left in May 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Embassy doing in all this? What was their
                        position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, as you recall, I did not have a warm, fuzzy relationship with the
                    Assistant Administrator for Africa who was a personal friend of the Ambassador
                    who replaced David Miller.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The new Ambassador's friend was the successor of Goler
                        Butcher.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That's right. Now, on looking back, it seems to me that the arrival of
                    the new Ambassador in the summer of 1984 either marked or coincided with a
                    significant hardening of the U.S. attitude toward Tanzania. You might say he was
                    ideally cast for the role of U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania at that particular
                    moment, although I'm not entirely sure that the U.S. posture was meant to be as
                    negative as he seemed inclined to make it. He was a very complex person. At the
                    outset, though somewhat less so later, he and his wife (a Foreign Service
                    Officer on leave without pay) seemed not to like Tanzania and to be
                    uncomfortable with Tanzanians. Someone who wanted to soften my impression of him
                    told me that he had hoped for an Ambassadorship to Hungary since he spoke the
                    language fluently and that he desperately hoped that he would be rewarded with
                    such an assignment if he did well in Tanzania. He seemed personally offended by
                    Tanzania's special brand of African socialism, which had many of the negatives
                    of Soviet Bloc Communism - including the corrupt, inept, cynical and
                    hypocritical apparatchiks of the sole legal party - but not the human rights
                    abuses. Enthusiastic about the negatives in the USAID relationship with
                    Tanzania, he seemed always on the lookout for ways of rendering our posture and
                    actions more unfavorable and unpalatable than necessary. He found various ways
                    to convey that he viewed my commitment to implementing our programs and the
                    phase-out plan according to the agreed timetable as thinly disguised disloyalty
                    to him and the lofty principles underlying the Reagan State Department's stance
                    toward Tanzania. A phrase that appeared in one of my annual evaluation reports
                    went something like “Mr. Gilbert's loyalty to his programs impairs his
                    effectiveness as a member of the country team.” My evaluations during his tenure
                    conveyed a tone of icy reserve (as if they decided not to mention that I was a
                    child molester).</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>Predictably, he and I came into early conflict because he wasted little time in
                    seeking ways to hasten the phase-out of the AID program and reduce our presence.
                    When I foolishly talked about signs that the Tanzanians would launch economic
                    policy reforms that could eventually lead to an IMF package and that this, in
                    turn, would enable them to clear their arrears, make them eligible for a Paris
                    Club debt rescheduling, it apparently confirmed his view that I needed to be
                    watched for signs of backsliding on the phase-out plan. That was bad enough, but
                    it got worse because he began to look for ways of accelerating phase-out. When I
                    told him that would violate amended project agreements and that were the
                    foundation of the phase-out plan, I soon got word that he was complaining in
                    Washington that I was insubordinate. When he took it into his head that he would
                    help us with the phase-out by making AID-owned property available to other
                    diplomatic missions. I explained to him that this was expressly contrary to the
                    phase-out plan. When I learned indirectly that he had started talking about
                    selling some properties that AID owned in Arusha, I arranged within AID to have
                    management responsibility for them transferred to REDSO in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>When we were putting together the human resources side of the phase-out plan, the
                    Ambassador and DCM (also from the Europe Bureau and with no experience in
                    Africa), were very suspicious and insisted on editing the communications we
                    issued to our own staff so that we wouldn't “give away the store.” The idea that
                    we would take pains to maintain the loyalty and cooperation of the national
                    staff just seemed to baffle and offend them.</p>
                <p>Later on when there was a food security emergency following on poor harvests in
                    Singida, Shinyanga, Dodoma and Tabora Regions, I initially encountered
                    resistance to our efforts to survey the situation and organize a modest but
                    essential response through Catholic Relief Services. They were suspicious that
                    we were trying to do with food aid what we couldn't do with Development
                    Assistance funds. Their attitude noticeably changed when they realized that part
                    of the problem we faced was that regional officials were not reporting on the
                    problem. Therefore, the Central Government was denying its existence and
                    resisting our efforts to document it. If I, whom they suspected of being overly
                    solicitous of the Tanzanians, was willing to irritate the GOT, maybe there
                    really was a compelling need.</p>
                <p>These skirmishes were unpleasant, but they had two salutary effects. One is that
                    higher ups in Washington began to appreciate what I was up against and became
                    more supportive. My relationship with the Ambassador became more functional
                    (though still not good) as he began to perceive that, even if I was a total
                    nobody in the upper circles of the Reagan administration and totally
                    uninterested in changing that, I was neither totally under his control nor
                    inclined to take his machinations lying down. I also got along very well with
                    most of the other elements of the U.S. Mission. USAID Tanzania was a remarkably
                    effective and harmonious organization with surprisingly good morale. These
                    assertions could not be made about the Ambassador and DCM or about the Embassy.
                    Toward mid-1985 I began to sense a grudging and wary respeceven occasional
                    efforts to “make nice” and to work on promoting post morale.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: So, we continued to implement the phase-out plan. We continued to
                    participate in donor coordination meetings and activities organized by the World
                    Bank Resident Representative, Ron Fennell. As is often the case with a resident
                    USAID Mission, we were much sought out by staff of other donor institutions who
                    wanted the “local” knowledge and perspective that our people could provide
                    concerning issues that they were seized with. I think it was early or mid-1985
                    that the donors found themselves in a policy dialogue with the Tanzanians. We
                    found ourselves supporting it mainly with the analytical work that Joe Goodwin
                    and Dick Neuburg had done, but also with modest updates of information and
                    analysis that we were able to furnish. We still had one Program Economist and a
                    number of other staff with good analytical skills and in-depth knowledge of the
                    sectors for which they were responsible: agriculture, livestock, education,
                    public administration, public health and population as well as economics.</p>
                <p>The World Bank and the IMF led the first phase of this renewed policy dialogue.
                    Not much progress was made, however, until the Swedes and, to a lesser extent,
                    the other Nordic donors began to participate and take an active interest. This
                    was precipitated in large part by visits by journalists. Articles soon began to
                    appear in Swedish and other Nordic newspapers calling attention to the failures
                    of the Tanzanian economy and, by implication, of Nordic programs. Tanzania was
                    one of the largest recipients of Nordic assistance. Sweden was the largest
                    bilateral donor of traditional assistance (the Japanese may have been nominally
                    larger owing to huge non-project, scatter-gun grants of commodities and
                    equipment) and the other Nordics were close behind. Before this the
                    parliamentary system had helped to shield Nordic aid issues from the scrutiny of
                    public opinion. As long as there was a consensus within the ruling party or
                    coalition, party discipline prevented searching debate, let alone controversy.
                    And the Scandinavians, as a group, were terrible Third World groupies, and they
                    could be insufferably sanctimonious about it. They tended to see themselves as
                    morally superior to the other donors because their aid was unconditional. They
                    usually went along with the Tanzanians' claim that their policies were sound,
                    only poorly implemented because of manpower shortages and training deficiencies.
                    But the articles caused something of a taxpayers' revolt, and that produced a
                    sea change in Nordic aid policy toward Tanzania.</p>
                <p>And once the Tanzanians saw that the Swedes and other Nordics were raising the
                    same issues they had preciously been hearing about from the U.S., the World Bank
                    and the IMF, they knew the jig would soon be up. Also, the economy kept getting
                    worse and worse. After a bit the Swedes in particular laid down a marker to the
                    effect that their assistance could not continue at its previous volume unless
                    the Tanzanians addressed the fundamental policy failures. From that point on,
                    the Tanzanians became active partners in the dialogue with the Bank and the
                    Fund.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>The phase-out plan called for me to leave in the summer or fall of 1986, but I
                    was transferred to Khartoum as Deputy Director in May 1986 following R and R. It
                    wasn't too long after I left that the real turnaround began. They came up with a
                    revised policy framework and that led to debt rescheduling which took care of
                    Brooke.Joe Stepanek was sent out as AID Representative. A core FSN staff, a
                    housing pool, an administrative framework and a logistics base were there for
                    him and his U.S. direct-hire team to work with. There could have been a lot
                    less.</p>
                <p>It is a good example of the conflict between short-term and long-term goals and,
                    in my opinion, the benefits of emphasizing the latter. Tanzania certainly
                    continues to have a lot of problems. It is still a very poor country. But there
                    is economic growth now. It is, to a large extent, an open economy. There is
                    significant corruption, but it is also a society that has demonstrated a
                    capability for course correction. I think it is one of the most stable political
                    entities in Africa. They have demonstrated that they have the capacity to
                    process corrective feedback constructively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What programs were you working on that continued or that
                        you were keeping alive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: One of then was a school construction project in two provinces in the
                    center of the country. I believe we cut back on the original plan and
                    concentrated on rehabilitating essential classroom spaces plus providing washing
                    facilities and VIP (ventilated, improved, pit?) latrines so that the schools
                    could be used for environmental sanitation and health demonstration sites.</p>
                <p>Then there was a project called Training for Rural Development (TRD) II. And a
                    nice, (unauthorized and) summary description of that project was that it was
                    designed, in effect, to make the government system for administration of the
                    rural economy function despite itself. The 1968 Arusha Declaration had laid out
                    a policy of villagization and non-market-oriented development for the rural
                    sector. This amounted to mild collectivization of the peasantry. It was the
                    cornerstone of the Tanzanian rural development strategy. TRD II and its
                    predecessor aimed to develop administrative systems as well as leadership and
                    management skills among the cadre of regional- and district-level officers on
                    whom the implementation of rural development depended. The project was extremely
                    popular and the two USDA PASA technicians who ran it were probably the best
                    loved and most widely plugged in members of the American community. It was
                    successful in achieving its outputs of trained staff and related behavioral
                    changes. The civil servants it served were highly motivated and had an
                    impressive esprit de corps, too. I believe the project was essentially a good
                    one and that it made a lasting contribution to Tanzanian development.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>But I fear that Tanzania's leadership saw this project as the silver bullet that
                    would make development occur in the rural areas by force of the leadership,
                    dedication and efficiency of an elite cadre of government administrators
                    notwithstanding the dearth of transport infrastructure and services, of produce
                    and inputs markets and of funding for public health services and education
                    resulting from Tanzania's deeply flawed rural development model which gave no
                    legitimate scope to market forces and private commerce.</p>
                <p>We were also implementing three other projects. We were working with the Tanzania
                    Rural Development Bank to establish a village-level lending program. We were
                    involved in Farming Systems Research through a contract with Oregon State
                    University. I can't remember the counterpart institution that we were working
                    with. Maybe the most interesting project we had was with the Zanzibar health
                    ministry on malaria eradication.</p>
                <p>I learned a number of lessons in Tanzania. One of them was to be wary of the
                    ideal employee. In a sense we suffered from too examples of the “ideal employee”
                    syndrome. We had an Asian-Tanzanian guy in the GSO operation who was an
                    extremely attractive, personable individual. He was unbelievably dedicated and
                    efficient. Everyone loved him, especially the Marinewho were not famous for
                    their admiration of the local people. He played on the AID softball team and hit
                    several home runs every game. He had a nice family. No doubt, like many of our
                    Tanzanian employees, he was worried about his future. Unlike most, he decided to
                    take bold action. One day he just didn't come to work anymore. We found out that
                    he and his family had gone to Canada on tourist visas. We immediately audited
                    all the stocks and funds that he had had anything to do with. It turned out that
                    he had managed to divert about $40,000 worth of gasoline from the GSO gas
                    supply.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>The other example was really bizarre. The School Health project had a technical
                    assistance component that was implemented under a contract with John Snow
                    International. The person who had been Chief of Party for several years had
                    departed post a few weeks before I got there, and the new Chief of Party arrived
                    not long after I did. The new chief of party was a young woman. She was smart
                    and energetic. Maybe about three or four weeks after her arrival I noted that
                    she went from being cheerful and bouncy to preoccupied and subdued. Finally, she
                    came in one day and told me she was not getting the cooperation she needed from
                    some of the national staff of the contracting firm. She was also getting active
                    non-cooperation from her main counterpart in the Ministry of Health. None of
                    what she described was acceptable. Some amounted to petty harassment, but some
                    of it was serious. She was asking for and not being given key records, including
                    financial accounting records. The more she probed the nastier the Tanzanians on
                    her contract and her Ministry of Health counterpart became. To me it seemed that
                    they were trying to intimidate her into getting back into her box, so to speak.
                    From then on we worked with her to deal with the situation. She managed to get
                    one document and study it at home. It revealed discrepancies. Finally she got
                    the firm's home office to send out copies of documents that they had which
                    confirmed that something was fishy. At that point, or even earlier, we notified
                    the Inspection and Investigation Staff (IIS) of the Regional Inspector General's
                    (RIG) Office in Nairobi. A few days later the Regional Investigator, and his
                    Kenyan assistant arrived in Dar and began an investigation.</p>
                <p>In order to understand the picture they pieced together over several visits, I
                    have to give some background.The former Chief of Party was an archetypal “big
                    man on campus” or “local hero” in the American official community. He charmed
                    everyone, including the Ambassador on whose guest lists he and his wife usually
                    figured. He not only had charisma, but he was the kind of person who seemed
                    always able to solve problems that buffaloed others. Everyone owed him a favor.
                    He had brought out an airplane that he used for getting back and forth to the
                    various School Health project sites. His wife ran a dancing school that was very
                    popular in the international community. He often stood in for the Regional
                    Medical Officer when his travels took him away from the Embassy Health Unit.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>I'm not sure I can accurately remember everything that he had been doing. I
                    remember for sure that he had been converting dollars advanced for project local
                    costs into Tanzanian shillings on the black market at several multiples of the
                    official exchange rate. This allowed him to meet all sorts of expenses including
                    those for operating his plane for non-project purposes. But this was just one
                    part of a larger picture. He had a Ph.D. in Public Health, but had passed
                    himself off to the Regional Medical Officer as an M.D. and had been practicing
                    medicine within the American community. He managed to convince the Embassy
                    administrative office that he should be allowed to convert a good portion of the
                    black market local currency back into dollars at the official rate. I think he
                    convinced the Embassy that his wife's dance school was sort of a community
                    service that generated local currency in excess of their needs, which was a
                    doubtful proposition because most of the students were international. He had
                    involved at least some of the Tanzanian project staff and some of the Ministry
                    of Health staff in these shenanigans. It was an amazing tangle. Even though our
                    project had not really suffered any financial loss, the sums that the Chief of
                    Project had been fiddling between the black market and the Embassy accommodation
                    exchange were largmany tens of thousands if not over a hundred thousand
                    dollars.</p>
                <p>In the end, the IIS recommended against pursuing the investigation to a
                    conclusion. They reasoned that they couldn't put a case together without
                    bringing the Tanzanian Government into the investigation. That would probably
                    mean that I and other senior people in the U.S. Mission would wind up spending
                    vast amounts of time dealing with the resulting furor rather than running our
                    programs. The “suspect” had mainly broken Tanzanian laws, and it was extremely
                    doubtful that, at the end of the day, IIS would have a case that would stand up
                    in a U.S. court. The Tanzanians may or may not have wanted to try him together
                    with his confederates, but it would have chewed up huge amounts of time and
                    money to get him extradited to Tanzania. Meanwhile the U.S. Mission would look
                    terrible in the eyes of the Tanzanian Government even if the case were
                    successfully tried. But the too likely scenario might be that the Tanzanians
                    would try some of their citizens and send them to prison while the U.S. would
                    not be able to extradite the main perpetrator or even convict him of breaking
                    U.S. laws. This would obviously make the U.S. look terrible and have negative
                    repercussions, to say the least, on the bilateral relationship. (At that
                    poinprobably in late 1983 or early 198the State Department still seemed to have
                    nearly normal regard for the sensitivities of the Tanzanians.) Another
                    consideration was the airplane. What nefarious uses he might have put it to
                    didn't bear thinking about. This was not only an example of the perfect employee
                    syndrome. It also showed that a malefactor can get away with a great deal if his
                    or her actions make enough other people, especially influential ones, look
                    foolish or lax. This experience led me in the remaining ten years of my career
                    to pay close attention to situations where people could potentially gain
                    exemption from normal controls on their conduct because of friendship with me or
                    other “higher ups” in the U.S. Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say he was an American. Had he already returned to the

                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>GILBERT: He was an American and, as far as we knew, he was in the United States.
                    He had left the contracting firm. I think the IIS made a stab at finding him,
                    but could not.</p>
                <p>It was an unhappy time in Tanzania, in many ways. But I learned a lot and really
                    value those three years. Tanzania is such an interesting and unique country.</p>
                <p>As you know, AID has a nagging, continuous problem with participant trainees who
                    don't want to return home after completing their U.S. training programs. Someone
                    in the Office of International Training told me that one of the lowest
                    non-return rates was for Tanzania. Despite all its problems, Tanzania under
                    Julius Nyerere had become a society that Tanzanians valued a great deal. There
                    is very little tribalism. Almost everybody speaks Swahili as the national
                    language. This meant that there was a national culture that most people could
                    share in. It was a very egalitarian society. Few were rich, but most educated
                    people seemed able to live with a modicum of comfort. There are a lot of
                    intertribal marriages among the educated.</p>
                <p>The economy operated along interesting lines. There was very little in the stores
                    except for the items from Eastern Bloc countries that no one wanted to buy. Most
                    Tanzanians worked for the Government or for parastatals. Their pay was just
                    about enough to cover their food requirements and pay the rent on the subsidized
                    housing they received through their employer. Each government unit or parastatal
                    had a cooperative through which employees received allocations of staple foods.
                    If they wanted much more than that out of life, like to be able to buy school
                    uniforms for their kids, they had to have another source of income. Almost
                    everyone had a substantial garden or small farm (shamba, which literally means
                    “field”). But it seemed that most people or families also ran a small business
                    of some kind. Some might own a taxi and hire a drivers to run them. Others might
                    have milk cows or laying hens. Some women might make clothes to order. It was
                    ironic that the failure of this socialist economy forced everyone to become a
                    small-scale entrepreneur, breaking the rules of the economy in order to prevent
                    its collapse. And the higher ups in the only legal party almost universally ran
                    businessethe bigger the official the bigger the business. Now that's
                    hypocrisy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find them to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>GILBERT: On the whole, they were good to work with. The only really foul ball
                    that I had to deal with was the Ministry of Health official responsible for the
                    School Health project. He was a crook. (I settled him down by showing him the
                    draft of an official letter that I would have sent if he didn't back off. The
                    letter summarized the positions he had been taking on the School Health project
                    in the context of explaining why they were unacceptable to us.) But he was the
                    exception that proved the rule. The rest were a pleasure to deal with except
                    when they were feuding with one another. There were a number of
                    individualespecially those with U.S. or British training - who were extremely
                    effective and very dedicated. All of these people freely acknowledged that
                    Tanzania's African socialist economic policies and strategies had failed and
                    needed to be changed. That was an almost universal opinion. The universally held
                    corollary was that those policies couldn't change until “Mwalimu” (or “Teacher”,
                    the rather reverential universal nickname-title accorded to Nyerere) stepped
                    down. Most Tanzanians considered him to be a great man (and I agree) who
                    suffered from a major blind spot when it came to economic issues.</p>
                <p>One of the best of our Tanzanian colleagues was the person they placed at the
                    head of an inter-ministerial committee they established to program counterpart
                    currencies to be used for development budget support. We had excellent relations
                    with him. We managed to make sure that our projects got priority within the
                    development budget and, once those needs were met, we sought priority for other
                    donor project-related items. The Chairman of this Committee (or he may have been
                    the Secretary with a more senior figure as the titular chairman) was a young man
                    named Vincent Mrisho, who served in an agricultural policy and planning unit
                    that may have been headed by Simon Mbalini. Vincent really ran with this
                    responsibility. He set up a committee with sharp people from all the ministries.
                    We assigned our Program Officer to be the USAID liaison with this committee. Cap
                    Dean was our Program Officer and my de facto Deputy my the first two years or so
                    there. Our technical staff also attended meetings when appropriate. Vincent and
                    we agreed on a system that required pretty clear project-type documentation for
                    proposed uses of counterpart funds. Thus these uses had to be justified in terms
                    of a definite outcome over a specific period of time. Each allocation had to
                    have sponsors who would take responsibility for monitoring implementation and
                    for writing progress and completion reports. Our Tanzanian collaborators seemed
                    sincerely committed to the system and process because it was rational and
                    produced a lot of good outcomes, something that was very rare in their
                    world.</p>

                <p>GILBERT: Well the activities and physical works that were financed with
                    counterpart funds produced real benefits for a time. The same was true of all
                    that we accomplished in wrapping up our dollar-funded projects. I'm confident of
                    this. What I'm not sure of is how sustainable over the longer run our
                    accomplishments proved to be. To me the experience and the skills gained by our
                    Tanzanian counterparts were equally important as the other results of our
                    projects. At least one among all these people went on to bigger things. I had a
                    reunion with Vincent Mrisho while on a consultancy in Tanzania in 1994. At that
                    time he was the Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Industries and Trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any remnants of earlier USAID projects that

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well there were a number of projects that were in their last year during
                    FY 1984. These included the Seed Multiplication and Distribution, Agricultural
                    Research, Farmer Training and Production, Livestock Marketing and Development,
                    Agriculture Education and Extension and Continuing Education for Health Workers
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with these projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: These activities were completed with some foreshortening of their
                    durations and work programs so that operations ended pretty much by the end of
                    FY 84. There were probably some continuing expenditures and completion reports
                    to be completed. Some of this work was done for us by REDSO so that we didn't
                    have to keep project managers around solely for those kinds of formalities. I
                    frankly don't remember much about those projects. Cap Dean might remember more
                    about them since he was the Program Officer and their continuing needs no doubt
                    figured in the deliberations of the counterpart programming committee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. What about the universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I believe we had a relationship with the degree level agricultural
                    education facility in Morogoro (which was, I believe, a Faculty of the
                    University of Dar es Salaam). We must have had a technical assistance team there
                    at one point, but I'm pretty sure it had departed before I arrived. I believe
                    Joe Goodwin and his assistant had collaborated with Adolpho Mascarenas at the
                    University of Dar es Salaam. He was the guiding spirit of a little policy think
                    tank out there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you weren't in on the university project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I don't remember being aware of any activities of that type. My belief
                    that we were involved with Morogoro comes from something I was told when we were
                    invited to a commencement exercise there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Zanzibar malaria project work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It accomplished a reduction in the incidence of malaria. It had to
                    grapple with two unexpected obstacles. One was chloroquine resistance in the
                    parasite. The other was DDT resistance in the mosquito that was the vector for
                    the parasite. I can't remember what we used on malaria cases that didn't respond
                    to chloroquine, but we used a product called Malathion in place of DDT for
                    spraying the mosquitoes. It was an interesting project. We were hopeful that we
                    could sharply reduce the incidence of malaria on the islands of Pemba and Unguja
                    owing to their distance from the mainland and their relatively small
                    populations.</p>
                <p>The islands of Zanzibar (chiefly Pemba and Unguja) are part of Tanzania, as you
                    know. They constitute quite a distinct society, however. The population is
                    solidly Muslim and the political culture was more Marxist as compared to the
                    mainland brand of Socialism, which has been described as Fabian in character and
                    definitely non-Marxist by knowledgeable observers. One had the feeling on
                    Zanzibar that big brother was watching you. There was a kind of militant feeling
                    to the place. The Zanzibari Director of the Malaria Project was a youngish man
                    named Dr. Juma Muchi. He had received most of his higher education at the
                    University of Kharkov in the Soviet Union. He was an excellent, hard-driving
                    manager and a technically sound public health physician.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would we have a project there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Since Zanzibar was part of the country, USAID needed to have a project
                    there and tackling malaria seemed highly appropriate. I found the project in
                    place. I believe it was the only active AID malaria project in the world. The
                    Zanzibar islands seemed to offer a reasonable hope of achieving lasting success
                    in reducing malaria's incidence to an acceptably low level and keeping it there
                    with only modest external help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The goal wasn't eradication?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Zanzibar is separated from the mainland by something like 25 miles. That
                    would probably prevent infected mainland mosquitoes from spreading the parasite,
                    but people go back and forth constantly and in considerable numbers. So there
                    would always be some reinfection of the mosquitoes. The main activities were
                    spraying houses and the environs of settled areas plus the draining some bodies
                    of stagnant water near urban areas. I can't remember what role mosquito nets
                    played. I think the treated mosquito net campaign came later once the project
                    closed. We never even considered screening because that would require sweeping
                    cultural change. It would be almost impossible to bring about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on Tanzania at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I think that is it. I would mention about Tanzania that one of its
                    pleasures was getting to know Jane Goodall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Jane Goodall, the chimpanzee lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: She was a neighbor of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was living in Dar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. Her son, “Grub” (real name Count Hugo Van Lawick, the somethingth),
                    our middle son, Chris, and I got to be very good fishing buddies. Chris and I,
                    in our boat, and Grub, in his, went on two fishing trips to Zanzibar. Chris and
                    Grub went on an “unauthorized” fishing trip to Zanzibar in Grub's boat that
                    lasted overnight and scared the daylights out of us. Chris was invited down to
                    Gombe, quite a rare thing. While Chris was there with Grub, the two of them
                    tangled with water cobras while engaged in underwater spear fishing at night in
                    Lake Tanganyika. Shared anxieties about the crazy things our sons got up to plus
                    social interaction at dinner parties caused us to “bond” with Jane.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, the research on the chimps. Anyway, that is just an aside.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: I guess the other thing I would say is that I thought Nyerere was one of
                    the most admirable African leaders I ever encountered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever meet him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, I shook hands with him a couple of times. We never talked though.
                    He was a very classy guy. As was so often the case among the post-independence
                    leaders of former British colonies, he had no understanding of even basic
                    economic principles. He freely admitted to making mistakes in a lot of areas,
                    but could never bring himself to admit that his economic policies were wrong.
                    This may have been an ego problem. I think it was so much a part of his personal
                    belief system that he couldn't renounce his socialist beliefs any more than his
                    Catholicism.</p>
                <p>On the other hand if he was unable to say it he was able to perceive what he had
                    to do to remedy the situation. He stepped aside. There aren't too many cases
                    where African leaders prepared their own removal from power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: And he knew very well that this meant that new policies would be
                    developed and applied. And once he was out of power, he mainly stayed in the
                    background. I believe he was still head of the party for a period. As such, he
                    would occasionally make a pronouncement on some national issue, but I don't
                    think he ever undercut the more market-oriented policies that the new leaders
                    put in place.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Before we leave Tanzania, I want to explain the philosophy that guided my
                    approach to the program phase-out that Tanzania's Brooke status made necessary.
                    The key fact to me was that we had project agreements with the Tanzanians. I
                    believe that when we sign an agreement we should live up to it, unless the
                    cooperating country violates its terms or we are prevented by something akin to
                    force majeure. Brooke falls into that category, but I felt that there was no
                    reason for us to be any harsher than necessary. The Government may have become
                    less deserving owing to its failure to service U.S. government debts and to
                    undertake policy reform. But the Government as Government is only one partner
                    and its stake in development projects is often rather indirect, abstract or,
                    even, theoretical. This contrasts with the stake that counterpart managers and
                    technicians have. Their professional fortunes are much more concretely linked to
                    our programs. Neither they nor the humbler beneficiaries of our projects bear
                    any blame for the shortcomings of the Government as Government. And both these
                    professional and humbler beneficiaries have often bet their livelihoods and
                    interests to some degree on the expectations created by our programs and
                    projects. So I thought, and still think, that it is immoral to break faith with
                    these real people unless there is no other choice, and, even then, only to the
                    extent absolutely necessary.</p>
                <p>As an AID officer, I never saw myself as responsible for defining or actively
                    promoting U.S. interests. I saw myself as constrained to operate within the
                    framework of U.S. interests as defined by the State Department or other
                    appropriate authorities, but as otherwise obligated to promote economic
                    development to the extent feasible and consistent with proper use of the
                    taxpayers' funds. Of course, on the few and rather brief occasions when I was
                    asked to serve as Charge d'Affaires, I considered that I ceased to be first and
                    foremost an AID officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. What happened after Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Assignment as Deputy Director and Mission Director in USAID/Sudan - 1986-1990</p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, in 1986 I went to Sudan as Deputy Director. I arrived there on my
                    birthday, May 28. It was a very troubled time. Jaafar Nimeiri, the long-time
                    President and dictator, had been forced from power by popular protests and
                    strikes about a year earlier because he had embraced Islamic fundamentalism and
                    introduced Sharia law. This had caused re-ignition of the civil war in Southern
                    Sudan. The interim government was pretty weak and ineffectual. Extremist Arab
                    groups began harassing the U.S. community. On April 15th or 16, 1986, an
                    American Embassy communicator, who had been called in to deal with a NIAC cable,
                    was followed and shot as he drove home from the Embassy. He was permanently
                    disabled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An embassy staff member?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. Either the same day or the next day, an AID wife employed in the
                    office of the Defense Attach� narrowly escaped somebody with a gun who
                    approached her car in a traffic jam.. The ambassador called an evacuation of all
                    dependents and of all nonessential staff.</p>
                <p>John Koehring had arrived a few weeks earlier than me to assume his duties as
                    Mission Director. He and I shared a house. Besides John and me, there were four
                    other U.S. direct hires there to manage the AID Mission. The USAID national
                    staff and we six Americans ran things as best we could until the end of October.
                    After that, there was a phased return of U.S. direct hire staff and
                    dependents.</p>
                <p>During the evacuation period we essentially mothballed AID development programs.
                    We still took some program actions, but we did so mainly to the extent necessary
                    to enable essential Sudanese Government operations related to our projects to go
                    forward.</p>
                <p>But we couldn't mothball our emergency programs. Also, the Sudanese seemed to
                    expect a lot of official and social interaction with us. This was, no doubt, in
                    large part an effort to reassure us that they valued our presence. It was also a
                    function of Joe Goodwin's having known people like the Minister of Finance when
                    he was a U.S.-trained economics professor at the University of Khartoum. I never
                    before or after experienced so much “face time” with Ministerial level host
                    government officials, and we were about as busy as I've ever been. We had at
                    least four disaster response programs going simultaneously at that time. During
                    the four years that I was there, I think we had 11 declared disasters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, from May 1986 to June1990. There were two or three western drought
                    emergencies. I arrived just as the first was winding down. There were two locust
                    outbreaks. There was one rat plague. And then there were at least two
                    declarations regarding the civil war in the south. There was the flooding of
                    1988. Of the biblical Egyptian plagues, we joked that we had them all except for
                    frogs.</p>
                <p>At that time the AID economic program in Sudan was the biggest in the Africa
                    Bureau. It was certainly the biggest mission in the Sub-Sahara Africa. As a
                    result of Sudan's good behavior with regard to Camp David and its cooperation
                    with the evacuation of the Falasha Jews from Ethiopia to Israel, the combined
                    Development Assistance, Economic Support Funds (ESF) and PL 480 Title I budget
                    was pretty close to $100 million dollars, and maybe more. That involved both
                    non-project and project assistance.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>To my recollection, there was never a time during my four years there when we
                    were not managing three or four emergency response programs. In addition to
                    strictly Sudanese emergencies, we were involved in shipping food through Sudan
                    to feed distressed populations in rebel-held territories of Ethiopia, chiefly
                    Eritrea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in Eritrea refugee support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: There were large numbers of Eritrean and other Ethiopian refugees in
                    Sudan. I believe the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
                    PVOs that worked with them on refugee feeding dealt directly with the
                    Humanitarian Bureau of the State Department, an attache of the Embassy
                    responsible for refugee matters and the food aid office of AID in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>I thought and still think that I worked hard, too hard, during the years I spent
                    in Washington on the Sahel program, but I never worked harder in my life than
                    during those four years in Sudan. The workload including the large amount of
                    representation, that we got caught up in combined to pose a major challenge to
                    our physical endurance. This was exacerbated by an accidental factor. The
                    Sudanese workweek ran from Saturday to Thursday. Ours was supposed to be from
                    Sunday through Thursday. But since the GOS worked on Saturday, and Washington
                    worked on Friday, we were often needed by AID/W on Friday and by the Government
                    of Sudan on Saturday. Also, Immediate and even NIAC cables were fairly
                    commonplace both for the Embassy and for AID. And, since lots of people finally
                    got the clearances on Thursday or Friday on the cables they drafted earlier in
                    the week, we seldom were spared dealing with urgent cables on Fridays and
                    Saturdays.</p>
                <p>During that whole period Jane always tried to make sure when we went out at night
                    to something that required us to sit for any length of time, that we were never
                    placed in full view of other people. This was to avoid embarrassment because she
                    knew that I could not sit quietly for more than five minutes without falling
                    asleep. She worried that people would think I was a drunk.</p>
                <p>But it was oddly exhilarating. It was exhilarating and wearing perhaps in the
                    same way that working in a hospital emergency room might be. You had the feeling
                    that if you overslept or screwed up it might cost human lives. Conversely, if
                    you succeeded in your efforts to squeeze 12 hours of work into an 11-hour day,
                    you could have the satisfaction of feeling that it made a real difference to
                    people's lives and livelihoods.</p>
                <p>Earlier, in relation to Ghana, we were talking about how many Ghanaian friends we
                    made and how meaningful that made those years for us. Sudan may have run about
                    even with Ghana in terms of the number of Sudanese who became not just
                    acquaintances, but friends whom we got to know in some depth. The Sudanese are
                    extremely hospitable people, and the Sudanese elite is quite cosmopolitan. On
                    the whole, they are very appealing people.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>One thing that keeps Sudan economically afloat is their good system of higher
                    education. The University of Khartoum, apart from one or two universities in the
                    Republic of South Africa, is the oldest in Sub-Sahara Africa. It produces
                    well-trained people in a variety of fields in numbers beyond the country's
                    needs. Many Sudanese university professors, physicians, airline pilots, police
                    and military officers, magistrates and judges are employed in the Middle East.
                    They speak Arabic, they are very observant Muslims, they stay out of local
                    politics, they are conspicuous and easy to watch because they are Black and, not
                    really comfortable outside Sudan, they seldom settle permanently abroad. All of
                    these characteristics plus their knowledge and skills make them ideal
                    intellectual guest workers. There are also lower level Sudanese guest workers in
                    many Middle Eastern and North Africa countries. High or low level, they all
                    remit significant shares of their earnings to their families at home, and they
                    mostly return to Sudan with assets to invest in a farm or a business.</p>
                <p>And so, an interesting thing about Sudan is that, even though the government was
                    always broke, the country never seemed to be. There was a tremendous amount of
                    production in the irrigated sector (cotton, rice, sorghum, groundnuts) and in
                    the large-scale, mechanized, rain-fed agricultural sector (sorghum, sesame and,
                    I believe, soybeans). Both sectors generated large volumes of exports. Sudan,
                    being a very disorganized country, the Government was not able to collect taxes
                    or control their borders very effectively. Since, with the exception of cotton,
                    these exports passed mainly through private trading networks, only a portion of
                    the earnings flowed through formal channels. This means that large revenue flows
                    were not taxed and only a portion of the foreign exchange earnings was captured
                    by the Central Bank. So the Government was always on the verge of financial
                    collapse. Yet there was an impressive amount of commercial activity. Although
                    there were few modern retail establishments, such as the super markets and
                    department stores that one could find in some of the more market-oriented
                    African countriesuch as Kenya, Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire - consumer goods,
                    including appliances, were abundant in people's houses. People somehow got their
                    hands on decent cars. People seemed to have the kinds of foodstuffs that they
                    needed for the national cuisine, which was Middle Eastern with a few local
                    idiosyncrasies. Just to show how “loosey goosey” the economy was, we used
                    U.S.-controlled local currency to buy Isuzu all-terrain vehicles that were
                    imported for us from Saudi Arabia. The money changed hands in Sudan, but the
                    cars were imported purseant to our orders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main program activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well we had everything that AID does except for low-cost housing. We had
                    a PL 480 Title I program that supplied wheat and wheat flour for bread making.
                    It was used to encourage the Sudanese to reduce bread subsidies and, later on,
                    to promote use of sorghum flour to reduce the country's dependence on imported
                    wheat. There were annual Commodity Import Programs. The only thematics that I
                    can recall concerning the CIand this would be just for one of thehad to do with
                    getting Sudan away from purchasing crude oil for their refinery on the spot
                    market, which was unnecessarily expensive.</p>
                <p>We had some very interesting development projects. There had been a number of
                    such projects for the South, but these had been suspended or terminated months
                    before I arrived. These included a couple of roads and road maintenance
                    projects, an agricultural development project and a large training project. For
                    the North, the main focus was on Western Sudan's rain-fed agricultural sector.
                    The Western Agriculture Road project consisted of AID's section of a road to
                    link Western Sudan's 10 million acres of cultivable land to Khartoum and world
                    markets. This was complemented by the Kordofan Rain-fed Agriculture project,
                    which comprised a cooperative-based agricultural credit component implemented
                    with technical assistance provided by Technoserve plus the construction of
                    feeder roads and the provision of grain storage facilities. The Western Sudan
                    Agricultural Research project focused on developing higher yielding varieties of
                    sorghum, millet, peanuts and sesame. The Agriculture Planning and Statistics
                    project aimed to strengthen agriculture sector planning and policy development
                    functions.</p>
                <p>In the energy sector, the Energy Planning and Management project assisted in the
                    management of the Blue Nile Power Grid that served the irrigated agriculture
                    sector and most of the country's industrial sector as well as the Khartoum urban
                    area. Rural Renewable Energy consisted of grants to increase the supply and
                    efficiency of local fuel wood resources and included improved charcoal-burning
                    stove as well as land cover mapping components.</p>
                <p>In the health sector the Rural Health Support project supported an Expanded
                    Program of Immunization (EPI) campaign and the Model Family Planning project
                    aimed to consolidate the efforts and approaches supported by a multiplicity of
                    AID centrally funded PVOs and contractors into an AID-supported, Sudanese
                    national program.</p>
                <p>We also had a variety of PVOs - including CARE, Save the Children (SCF), World
                    Vision, CRS, Action Plan International and others - engaged in centrally-funded
                    development activities around various parts of Northern Sudan.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>As in Tanzania, but on a much larger scale, the Government of Sudan and USAID
                    Sudan programmed counterpart local currencies through the Development Budget in
                    support of AID projects and many other priorities. We had a very collaborative
                    and productive working relationship with the section of the Ministry of Finance
                    that was responsible for development planning and management of the Development
                    Budget. That group was headed by Mohammed El Kheir el Zubeir, who is now Sudan's
                    Finance Minister.</p>
                <p>Maybe it's because the development program was pretty straightforward and managed
                    well by the Mission's technical divisions that my most vivid memories are of our
                    struggles with our various emergency assistance programs. The General
                    Development Office, which ran the emergency programs, was staffed with highly
                    capable people, but they were stretched too thin and their portfolio was
                    inherently chaotic and crisis ridden. We did virtually everything thorough such
                    PVOs as CARE, World Vision, Action International Against Hunger (AICF) the
                    International Rescue Committee and many, many others. And all this relief
                    activity had to be accepted by and nominally coordinated by the Sudan government
                    through a body called something like the High Commission for Relief Coordination
                    (HCRC). This body's posture varied between mildly constructive and loosely
                    obstructionist. Which tendency would prevail at any particular moment sometimes
                    seemed to reflect the Government's attitude toward the current mix of
                    emergencies and its relationships with the donor/PVO community, but at other
                    times appeared at variance with one or the other or both. The HCRC was mainly
                    responsible for monitoring and processing Government approval of all emergency
                    relief-related travel and program funding decisions. The donors and PVOs did the
                    real work of managing the emergency program under the coordination of the U.N.
                    Development Program (UNDP) Resident Coordinator.</p>
                <p>The Sudanese government was not a very coherent operation. Some organizationfor
                    example, the parastatals that ran the large irrigation schemes like the Gezira -
                    seemed pretty well managed. Impressive people were in evidence in most of the
                    organizations that we worked with, but the collective outcomes always seemed to
                    fall well short of the arithmetic sum of the individual efforts. A lack of
                    accountability encouraged anarchic behavior. There would be certain people whom
                    you could work with, but then, as often as not, you would find others had undone
                    your work with them. Sometimes people lower down in a structure would overrule
                    their bosses. Sometimes this would result from a breakdown in communications,
                    but at other times it was sheer, bloody-minded waywardness. People could get
                    away with such things since Ministries were often in the hands of, or even
                    divided among, competing political or religious fiefdoms and cliques. It was
                    widely understood that the staff of certain sections of one ministry consisted
                    largely of Communists while that of another were Muslim Brothers.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>As a result of all this squirrelly business the donor community usually needed to
                    operate on two levels: the managerial and the diplomatic. Managing our resources
                    was the straightforward part. Getting needed cooperatio- mostly just a matter of
                    concurrences -required constant diplomatic activity. Given the importance of the
                    relief efforts and the fact that the heads of UNDP and the European Union had
                    ambassadorial status, the American, British, Dutch, French and German missions
                    were involved at that level. This was essential to our success. It added
                    interest to the work because of the camaraderie that developed among the
                    Ambassadors and the managers, including me, who ran the programs. I don't think
                    I ever got to know the senior members of the diplomatic corps or the ministerial
                    level host government officials to such a degree as in Sudan. But it also meant
                    that we spent a huge amount of time in meetings within the donor/PVO community
                    and with the Sudanese. This meant that we in USAID had to work hand in glove
                    with the American Ambassador and DCM. That worked pretty well under Hume Horan
                    and Norman Anderson and their DCMs (David Shinn and Dane Smith, respectively). I
                    found it a good deal more difficult under their successors, basically because of
                    their personal styles, which were usually, and on occasion breathtakingly, “top
                    down.” I think I managed to prevent that style from overriding the management of
                    AID operations more than was warranted, but doing that was wearinlike being in
                    car driven by a reckless driver.</p>
                <p>Running emergency programs generally require a great deal of logistical planning
                    and management. Sometimes it can require investment in essential infrastructure.
                    For example, during the great Western Sudan drought emergency that was just
                    concluding in 1986, the U.S. provided the Sudanese a substantial number, say ten
                    or twelve, railway locomotives.</p>
                <p>We usually had one logistical expert planning and tracking delivery arrangements
                    for U.S. emergency aid in coordination with other experts who worked for the UN
                    Agencies such as World Food Program (WFP), United Nations Children's Fund
                    (UNICEF), the European Union (EU) and, to a lesser extent, the other bilateral
                    donors. For the most part, this was a question of getting relief off-loaded from
                    ships in Port Sudan and Mombasa for road transport to the South and for road and
                    rail transport to Western Sudan. But, when the situation became urgent in
                    Southern Sudan, we made massive use of airlifts. We also began to use rail and
                    river transport to reach certain Southern destinations. From that point on it
                    became necessary for the relief community, through the UN, to coordinate with
                    the Southern rebels, the SPLA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: When you consider that there were usually at least three operations of
                    this kind going on at one time, we really had our hands full. It wasn't long
                    before it became clear that either John Koehring or I would have to spend an
                    awful lot of time on relief matters and that it would be quite wasteful if we
                    didn't agree that one of us would mainly handle relief matters while the other
                    mainly handled development program matters. In early 1988, we decided that I
                    would oversee relief.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>This meant that I did a lot of traveling both in Northern Sudan and also to the
                    South. The only way to go to Southern Sudan was to fly. Until late 1988, we
                    generally chartered aircraft from Nile Safaris, a company that operated about 12
                    twin-engine, pressurized Cessna and Piper aircraft. From Northern Sudan we could
                    only fly to government-held towns. Those that I visited were Juba, Wau, Malakal,
                    Abyei and Aweil. We needed pressurized aircraft so we could fly at 12,500 feet
                    or higher and, thereby, be out of range of the SAM missiles that the SPLA had.
                    We would fly at that altitude to the town and then corkscrew down in tight
                    circles just above the town to land. The idea was that the government soldiers
                    on the ground maintained a perimeter around the town wide enough to keep the
                    SPLA beyond range of the planes as they descended. Nevertheless, I personally
                    know of four such flights that were shot down during or just after my time
                    there. We sometimes heard firing while we were on the ground in these
                    locations.</p>
                <p>Before I left Khartoum, I turned over the financial records of the
                    English-speaking Anglican congregation to a Scotsman who was a Nile Safaris
                    pilot. He was shot down and killed about 10 days later. I had flown with him. In
                    most cases the downed planes had failed to observe the “corkscrew” procedure. In
                    one case, however, the SPLA had slipped a SAM missile launcher into a
                    government-held town and hit a plane while it was doing the corkscrew maneuver.
                    (After the first time or so, I developed a habit of discussing corkscrew
                    procedure with the charter pilots in order to confirm that they understood its
                    purpose and were committed to use it.)</p>
                <p>When I left Sudan, I felt a sense of relief and gratitude that my U.S. Mission
                    colleagues, my family and I had gotten through my time there unscathed. It's the
                    only job I had where colleagues and friends were killed carrying out their
                    duties in the Southern war zone. Perhaps ten or so relief workers or pilots were
                    killed and at least as many more had close calls that could have claimed their
                    lives. I haven't even talked about the terrorist threat, which remained a
                    concern throughout our four years there. Well after the evacuation period had
                    ended but before we moved into the Mission Director's house in early 1989, there
                    was a bomb attack by the Black September Group on the Acropole Hotel (where we
                    occasionally went for dinner) and the mainly British Sudan Club. Another time,
                    Iraqi agents assassinated a dissident Iraqi cleric in the lobby of the Hilton
                    Hotel. After they shot their victim, they fired a random shot or two around the
                    lobby, sauntered to the main entrance, got in a car with Iraqi diplomatic tags
                    and drove away. As far as I ever heard the Sudanese never did anything about the
                    Iraqi incident. I think they did cooperate in pursuing the perpetrators of the
                    bombing. There were frequent security alerts. Given our knowledge that various
                    Palestinian, Libyan, Iranian and other Middle Eastern terrorist groups were
                    present in Sudan we took those things seriously. Most of us varied our routes
                    and exercised caution about leaving our cars unattended and about driving and
                    walking around in public places. But that was just a matter of making things a
                    little more difficult for anyone who wanted to get us. There was no way we could
                    go about the business of living without accepting an environmental risin effect,
                    that if they really wanted to get some of us they would eventually have their
                    chance.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an office in Juba at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. AID owned a large compound in Juba. It contained office facilities,
                    a warehouse, a maintenance workshop, residences and a swimming pool in a
                    campus-like setting. It was quite a pleasant layout. I believe the last U.S.
                    direct-hire officer based in Juba had departed about a year before my arrival in
                    May 1986. Whenever I went down there I was gratified and somewhat touched by the
                    way the national staff took care of the place. It was always spic and span, the
                    vehicles and other equipment were in good operating order and the houses were
                    well maintained and ready for temporary occupancy by TDYers. They also
                    maintained good communications with the Regional Government that was based in
                    Juba. I don't remember for sure whether Juba was considered the capital of the
                    Southern Region or only of Equatoria at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were running projects out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No. Our development projects in the South had been suspended for some
                    time. Project commodities (including road maintenance equipment) were stored in
                    Juba and the Juba staff monitored these arrangements. As for relief projects,
                    USAID Khartoum managed AID emergency relief grants to PVOs working in
                    government-controlled areas as well as contracts for the movement of food down
                    to the South from the North. REDSO in Nairobi managed similar grants to PVOs
                    working in rebel-held territory and contracts for moving food up to Southern
                    Sudan from Kenya through Uganda and/or Zaire. The Juba staff facilitated and
                    supported the conduct of relief work in and around Juba mostly by making the
                    communications and other facilities of the USAID compound available to PVOs and
                    donor agencies. For some time, we had also been allowing the donor/PVO community
                    resident in Juba to operate a recreation club based on use of the swimming pool
                    whose costs they covered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't Juba in the middle of the civil war then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it was, and sometimes the SPLA were more or less at the gates of
                    the city, but they never got inside the city of Juba. Most of the time that I
                    was there the government managed to control substantial areas around Juba plus a
                    corridor that ran south to Nimule on the border with Uganda and southwest
                    through Yei to the border with Zaire. The government often had control of the
                    Nile from Juba to the border with Uganda and sometimes for a distance to the
                    north of Juba.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was federal territory in...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, central government territory. And our compound was U.S. diplomatic
                    property in Juba. We wanted to make sure that its integrity was respected. Even
                    so, there were times when it was damaged by stray bullets on the occasions when
                    the SPLA made incursions close to Juba.</p>
                <p>We had a policy of letting the Sudanese staff and their families come out if they
                    wanted to. But most of the staff elected to remain in Juba, although some would
                    come up from time to time for consultations and a breatheespecially if things
                    were “bad”. Usually “bad” was a matter of food shortages and electricity
                    outages, but there were a few occasions when it was a function of stronger than
                    usual SPLA attacks. The government forces usually managed to stop these well
                    short of the city, but the SPLA occasionally got so close that fears arose lest
                    they might use artillery despite the risks to the civilian population. Then, in
                    1991 or so, about a year after I left, the SPLA again came close to taking the
                    city. I believe there was some shelling. The Army or some security forces within
                    the army rounded up a number of people who were suspected of being SPLA agents.
                    Andrew Tombe, who was the senior Sudanese staff member in Juba, and a driver
                    were arrested. Andrew was accused of communicating with the SPLA. Both were
                    summarily shot. Andrew was a very dedicated and squared-away guy. I believe that
                    shortly afterwards the compound ceased to operate as a U.S. Government
                    installation. I don't know what disposition was made of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything particular about the emergency operations, any
                        lessons or experience that is instructive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well I learned a lot about PVOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find them to work with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Unruly, by donor standards. They were a positive force but working with
                    them could be a bit trying. Most of the PVO field staff were very good as
                    individuals, especially in their moral dimension. Plenty of them were quite
                    sophisticated and efficient to boot. Some of them were putting their lives on
                    the line on a routine basis, especially those working in SPLA territory and,
                    therefore, subject to indiscriminate government bombing and ground attacks by
                    Arab militias as well as the Sudanese army. I came to have a particularly high
                    regard for organizations such as Doctors without Borders, the Irish PVOs Concern
                    and Goal, AICF (International Action against Hunger) and OXFAM/UK. But still, on
                    the whole, the PVOs represent a much richer mixture of strong and weak and sane
                    and insane and so forth than you have among the donors. One thing that I hadn't
                    appreciated before is the intensity of competition among PVOs. This competition
                    stems from the fact that, while PVOs genuinely do a lot of good in responding to
                    disaster situations, they also have to exploit those situations for fund-raising
                    purposes. This, I believe, lies at the root of some of the unseemly competition
                    for visibility and roles that occurs among them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Fortunately, because of my experiences in the Sahel drought emergency, I
                    had already learned some lessons that I was able to apply in Sudan. This was the
                    more fortunate because I don't think John Koehring had been involved in the same
                    wathat is with the Washington end of the Sahel drought emergency. I would have
                    to say that I benefitted from knowing something of how Washington can sometimes
                    behave when things are going badly in the field during an emergency situation.
                    Being on the ground in such situations can be a bit dangerous because
                    Washingtowhich in reality is more a field of forces than an operational entity -
                    can hold the field unit accountable without admitting accountability itself.</p>
                <p>And AID Washington goes through cycles of attention and inattention, concern and
                    unconcern or even denial. For example in 1988 we were deluged with
                    once-in-a-century rains from Khartoum all the way down to the northern parts of
                    Southern Sudan. There was massive flooding throughout these areas. And, while it
                    had been always been plenty difficult to get food to the areas in and around the
                    South where it was needed, it suddenly became virtually impossible to do so.
                    Khartoum and the surrounding areas were massively flooded, creating one of the
                    all time great crazy situations. I'll come back to that.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>All this hit when we were already in a major crisis because the war had been
                    generating large numbers of newly displaced people. We couldn't track these
                    people in the early phases of their movements because they were mostly wandering
                    in the bush until the lucky ones who survived would suddenly begin flooding into
                    government-held areas. We soon began to suspect that there were hundreds of
                    thousands of people on the move. Even if they pitched up where we could in
                    principle get food to them, tooling up for such an effort in a country the size
                    of Sudan with its feeble transport infrastructure was dangerously
                    time-consuming. We had been reporting on this situation and our efforts to deal
                    with it within the context of already declared emergencies for weeks before the
                    flooding hit. But once the flooding occurred, we not only found ourselves
                    managing a new flood emergency relief program focused on the needs of many
                    thousands of homeless people, but also trying to coordinate a southern emergency
                    relief effort that had been pushed by the floods from crisis to hyper crisis
                    status. We continued to react and report as best we could even though the
                    Khartoum floods rendered all but the first one or two floors of our eight story
                    building unusable and forced us to set up eight or so temporary offices around
                    town.</p>
                <p>As time passed our reporting and general cable traffic described the locations
                    and the needs of the tens of thousands of southern displaced and the fact that
                    ground transport was falling short and would continue to fall short of meeting
                    the needs of many assemblies of the newly displaced needy populations that were
                    being identified (sometimes only by hearsay). Airlifts were an obvious response
                    in some of the larger government-held towns like Juba, Wau, Malakal and a few
                    others, but some of the displaced were in areas where there were no usable
                    airfields and where the SPLA were so close that the corkscrew maneuver wouldn't
                    work even if the airfields had been usable. So reconnaissance visits, let alone
                    airdrops, were not possible without grave risk to pilots and passengers in the
                    air or to people on the ground if airdrops were attempted without proper advance
                    arrangements.</p>
                <p>But in any case, we maintained a flow of reporting on the situation and laid out
                    the options that we could identify for dealing with the needs. We also requested
                    the funding we needed to move forward. The replies we got from AID Washington
                    consisted in large part of requests for more information on the situation plus
                    queries about what other donors and the UN were planning to do and whether we
                    had thought of this and that unrealistic option. And then the press began to
                    show up. Not long after the press began to show interest, I got a phone call
                    from Julia Taft, the Director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Relief. The gist
                    of her side of the conversation was something like: “We think it's time to do
                    something and we want to send a team out there since you folks aren't really on
                    top of the situation or coming to grips with it. My response can be summarized
                    as, “We'd like to have that team and we will need the funding we have been
                    asking for. We haven't been twiddling our thumbs. Have a look at the cable
                    traffic.” There was a little pause while she considered my rejoinder, but she
                    let it pass without comment. It was all very polite, and I was enormously
                    relieved that OFDA had decided to engage.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>A rather large team arrived. I consisted of an OFDA Team Leader whom I won't
                    name, plus the famous and late Fred Cuny, Larry Meserve from Food for Peace
                    (FFP), Ron Libby (an OFDA contract employee), at least one other OFDA person,
                    one or two other civilian experts and a military logistics team. They did some
                    very good work. But it was soon also clear that the OFDA Team Leader saw us as
                    his adversaries in a zero sum game. He acted as though he couldn't look good
                    unless we looked bad. He was smart and very active, but he was an awful poseur.
                    In his briefings of the donor heads of mission grouespecially at the beginning
                    before he digested the feedback he received - he would talk to them as if he was
                    the resident who knew the lay of the land and the rest of us were the visitors
                    who didn't know what had been going on or worse yet, didn't care. This wasn't
                    only my own prickly reaction. Members of his own team had problems with him, and
                    he had a knack for making the female members cry. Finally the dialogue between
                    the OFDA team and the donor group brought the former to the realization that
                    most of their good ideas couldn't be accomplished within the current rules which
                    specified, inter alia, that we worked with the Government in
                    Government-controlled areas, that communications with the SPLA were inadmissible
                    and that cooperation with the SPLA was out of the question. This was an
                    important realization and, to their great credit, OFDA concluded that the rules
                    had to change.</p>
                <p>Unpleasant as this process was, it turned out to be extremely worthwhile. The
                    result was truly a paradigm shift that gave birth to Operation Lifeline Sudan
                    (OLS). Julia Taft, a truly remarkable woman, managed to ratchet the political
                    profile of the Southern Sudan humanitarian emergency to an unprecedented level.
                    Her husband was Deputy Defense Secretary so she could call forth impressive
                    levels of cooperation from the Pentagon and to a lesser extent from the upper
                    echelons of the administration. She somehow tapped the head of UNICEF, James
                    Grant, to be the UN system's coordinator of OLS. She organized a consensus
                    within State, AID and the NSC in favor of a full-court diplomatic press on the
                    Sudanese and, then, the SPLA to cooperate in assuring safe passage for relief
                    food shipments by road, rail and air to the displaced in both government-held
                    and SPLA-held territory. Even so it took some time and arm-twisting to get the
                    Sudanese and, after them, the SPLA to accept this concept. But it was absolutely
                    necessary because each side could use military means to either prevent relief
                    from the others' areas absolutely or to make doing so unacceptably risky to
                    international relief workers. And both sides were exceptionally bloody-minded
                    about the issue. The Sudanese Government was convinced that the international
                    relief community favored the SPLA and would smuggle weapons and ammunition to
                    them in relief shipments. The SPLA was convinced that the Government could and
                    would force the relief agencies to carry supplies for their garrisons. Both
                    sides, as has been said many times, were willing to use food as a weapon.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>The developments, including the first OFDA team visit and at least one subsequent
                    one, leading to the launching of OLS took place during the fall of 1988.
                    Somewhere along the linprobably not long after the first OLS team had returned
                    to Washington - Congress began to take renewed interest in Southern Sudan. We
                    got a cable to the effect that AID higher ups were going to have to testify on
                    the situation and that those preparing the briefing materials needed for us to
                    answer a list of questions. And I didn't like the questiontoo many of them were
                    snotty and insinuatingly accusatory in tone. But we responded like good
                    professionals, and our people prepared the information that had to be in
                    Washington by COB on a given day. The answers formed two cables that came to me
                    in the late afternoon of the day that they had to be received about seven hours
                    later in Washington. There was just barely enough time to get them over to the
                    Embassy for transmission as non-NIAC immediate cables before the Embassy
                    communications unit closed down for the day. They were very long. I read through
                    them quickly (for me) with one or two of the GDO staff pacing up and down
                    outside my office. (John Koehring's need to deal with problems facing a member
                    of his family in the U.S. kept him away from post during much, if not most, of
                    1988 until his departure later that year, so I was Acting Mission Director for
                    extended periods.) The cables were fine except for one thing that prevented me
                    from authorizing them. The GDO staffers almost had a collective stroke when I
                    told them that, but when they understood what I wanted they enthusiastically and
                    quickly complied. I had them reference every message that we had sent to
                    Washington over the preceding six months on the matters that each addressed. The
                    references, and the dates on which each was sent, required at least the initial
                    page and a half of each message. This delay required that each cable be
                    transmitted as a NIAC immediate, but that was helpful since it helped to insure
                    the special handling needed on the other end.</p>
                <p>I'll never know for sure, but I have a strong feeling that this exercise in low
                    animal cunning made a great and positive difference in the way the Mission was
                    regarded and listened to in the subsequent weeks and months as OLS was
                    conceived, cobbled together and implemented. The tone of our communications with
                    Washington improved immediately. I firmly believe that people in the
                    humanitarian relief offices in Washington and, to a lesser extent, the Africa
                    Bureau had been receiving our cables and not heeding them. And once the fat was
                    in the fire, they were doing what comes naturally. The French have an expression
                    that sums it up beautifully: “Les absents ont toujours tort.” It's better than
                    our “It's always the other guys fault,” because the fundamentally human thing is
                    to blame those who are absent and can't defend themselves. Another expression
                    that bears on this is “Water (including waste water!) runs down hill.”
                    Washington is uphill from the field.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>So the relief operation entered the OLS phase sometime during the fall of 1988.
                    The UN was able to negotiate with the SPLA to allow trains to go from the North
                    to some parts of the South and to send road convoys into SPLA territory from
                    Kenya through Uganda and Zaire. But even so, it wasn't all smooth sailing. There
                    were nasty incidents. The U.N. Resident Representative at the time, Brian
                    Wannop, led the UN team that accompanied the first train down from northern
                    Sudan to Aweil and, perhaps, to Wau. They came very close to getting killed. The
                    train was unguarded, but the Government and the SPLA had each agreed to
                    facilitate the train's progress and assure its safety from their own forces.
                    They did what they were supposed to do, and the train off-loaded relief supplies
                    as it passed through both government-held and SPLA-held towns.</p>
                <p>But there were progovernment, border-dwelling Arab militias and plain bandits who
                    honored an ancient tradition by raiding into the Northern sections of Dinka
                    country for cattle and slaves. The Government either couldn't control their
                    activities or didn't choose to. From what I saw of the way things worked in
                    Sudan, the Government probably couldn't control them and chose not to incur the
                    domestic political cost of trying. I remember that in the negotiations with the
                    Minister of Transportation (General Burmah Nasser) concerning the use of the
                    train for this purpose, he seemed genuinely worried about the train's security
                    from “bandits”. As I recall, he wanted to have armed soldiers on the train, but
                    this was not acceptable to the SPLA.</p>
                <p>One of these militia or bandit groups stopped the train, took what relief
                    supplies they wanted and abducted the UN party. They took them into the bush for
                    several hours. During that time they debated whether they should hold them for
                    ransom, kill them or let them go. At least one member of the party, a medical
                    doctor, was Sudanese, and he heard the debate. The raiders finally decided to
                    let the UN folks return to the train and let the train continue on its way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The supplies got through?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, that time. I think there was one subsequent train, but that never
                    really became a significant way of moving food. And the main way of getting food
                    down to the south from the North was to fly it into the government-controlled
                    towns (Wau, Malakal, Aweil and Juba). The most common mode of getting food to
                    areas not served by operational airfields, whether SPLA- or Government-held, was
                    by road from Mombasa across the Kenya, Uganda and Zaire borders. These road
                    corridors were chancy because roads were prone to rapid deterioration with
                    increased use, especially during the rainy season. Collapsed bridges were a
                    frequent problem. I can't remember whether this happened before or during OLS,
                    but there was a report of a convoy of about twelve trucks getting stuck in
                    northeastern Zaire. They couldn't go backwards or forwards. After a while we
                    heard that the drivers had taken local wives and become part of the Zairian
                    community. Those supplies had to be written off. I don't know if the owners ever
                    got their trucks back.To return to the subject of relief logistics, one of the
                    most challenging problems in mounting a large-scale emergency relief effort is
                    off-loading, transporting and distributing relief supplies once they arrive in
                    port. Port capacities are seldom adequate to deal with multiples of the normal
                    volume of imports. The capacity of national trucking firms and railways are, at
                    best, proportionate to the amount of haulage normally required for a nation's
                    business (unless and until, as in Sudan's case, emergencies begin to seem
                    normal). When a large relief operation starts, transportation resources have to
                    be bid away from the normal users. Prices mount accordingly. Sometimes donors
                    and relief agencies have to augment the capacity of national systems as the U.S.
                    did with the locomotives they provided during the western Sudan drought of the
                    mid-1980s. An issue that frequently comes up is whether to finance increased
                    port unloading and warehousing capacity. Another is whether to permit transport
                    firms from neighboring countries to compete for relief business. For Southern
                    Sudan this was a need but not much of an issue given that there was no choice
                    but to use Kenyan trucking operators.</p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>At the advent of OLS, it was necessary to bring in air transport operators for
                    the needed airlifts of supplies and relief staff. AID financed the incorporation
                    into OLS of a PVO called AirServe that specialized in flying relief supplies in
                    humanitarian emergency situations. As I recall, they mainly operated Twin
                    Otters. These guys did a wonderful job and, fortunately, none of them were hurt
                    despite the fact that they operated at the limits of human endurance to maintain
                    a steady stream of deliveries to places where, by then, the displaced were dying
                    everyday by tens and hundreds, depending on the numbers gathered at each
                    location. The Sudanese work gangs for loading and unloading on each end were so
                    organized and so efficient that the planes were scarcely on the ground long
                    enough for the pilots' pit stops and for refuelinand that only when necessary.
                    It seems to me that they mostly didn't kill the engines because, absent those
                    needs, they were on the ground only for five or ten minutes. I believe the work
                    gangs were encouraged to compete with one another. For the larger towns with
                    concrete airstrips, OLS used Hercules C-130s. Commercial contractors may have
                    supplied some of these but Belgian, German and other air forces provided a fair
                    number, if not all. I don't think the U.S. Air Force provided aircraft to OLS.
                    If they did, it was early on and very briefly. As I recall, this was because the
                    Defense Department couldn't allow its planes to be used for nonmilitary purposes
                    without payment. I believe I was told that it would have cost OFDA more to
                    reimburse the Pentagon than to hire the requisite C-130s from a commercial
                    outfit like Southern Air.</p>
                <p>One of the exciting things about Cynthia Taft's link through her husband to the
                    Pentagon had been the prospect of their being more forthcoming in supporting the
                    relief effort. But the only concrete manifestation of Defense Department
                    involvement in Sudan relief work that I can recall came before OLS was even a
                    gleam in anyone's eye. Shortly after the Khartoum and northern floods hit, a
                    U.S. air force C-5 Starlifter, a huge aircraft that looks larger than a Boeing
                    747, arrived at the Khartoum airport loaded with relief supplies and equipment.
                    That was an awesome sight. It came at a time when most neighboring Arab
                    countriewho never made the slightest gesture that I can recall to help with less
                    dramatic emergency needs such as the western drought or those of the southern
                    displacehad been sending C-130s loaded with relief supplies. The C-5 was, let's
                    say, a striking symbolic reminder of who had been and who would continue to be
                    doing the “heavy lifting” of meeting Sudan's relief needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>This reminds me of something that bears on the question of the U.S. military
                    helping to meet emergency relief needs. In the build up to OLS we found
                    ourselves needing more and more to arrange transport down to some of the
                    southern towns where the displaced were gathering. Col. Joe Kennedy, our Defense
                    Attach� (DATT) in Khartoum, a peach of guwas anxious to do anything to be
                    helpful. I believe he was in Army aviation rather than the Air Force. He and
                    another officer in the DATT Office doubled as pilot and co-pilot of the DATT
                    aircraft. He suggested using his training flight budget to fly us to these
                    southern towns. We were thrilled because we had been told “no way” in response
                    to our past requests for use the DATT aircraft (before Kennedy arrived) unless
                    we were prepared to pay in appropriated funds, in which case they might consider
                    it. Somehow it was clear that our interest was not at all welcome. Since we had
                    no dollar budget for such flights, we could pay Nile Safaris in counterpart
                    currency and they welcomed the business, we made the obvious choice. But we
                    hoped that Joe would get an okay when he checked signals with the Pentagon on
                    his training flights idea.Unfortunately, it was not to be. Joe told us that they
                    wouldn't let him do it because that would take him into a war zone, and it
                    involved a risk to him and the aircraft that they couldn't accept. Apparently if
                    one of us civilians had gotten hurt, killed or taken hostage that would be
                    unfortunate but that wouldn't be the Pentagon's problem to explain or otherwise
                    deal with. However, if that happened to members of the armed forces it would
                    have wider and more serious implications (and they would have lots of forms to
                    fill out!). Seriously, I think we were told that there was some legal
                    requirement for congressional notifications when U.S. military personnel were
                    sent into a war zone. Joe was very embarrassed, and we were all struck by the
                    irony of it. The National Security Council (NSC) exists in response to a real
                    need!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't some sort of a truce been negotiated between the
                        two parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, but it was termed a “food truce.” It was important because that is
                    what made OLS possible. But it was limited. The initial idea was that it would
                    last six weeks or a couple of months. And the two sides weren't obliged to cease
                    overall hostilities, but only to respect the OLS food flights, trains and road
                    convoys and the facilities for storing and distributing relief to needy, mostly
                    displaced populations. Also, it's important to realize that the “food truce” was
                    not fool proof. There were breaches and interruptions. For example, the shooting
                    down of the relief flight by the SAM III that the SPLA had infiltrated into a
                    town occurred after OLS had been in operation for some time.</p>

                <p>GILBERT: Maybe this is where I should interject something that happened later on
                    when I was in Abidjan. On my return from a vacation in the U.S., I was invited
                    to a meeting with John Garang, the SPLA leader. He happened to be in Abidjan and
                    a mutual acquaintance had suggested that he meet with me. I checked with
                    Ambassador Ken Brown to make sure it was okay and to see if he had any guidance.
                    The Ambassador said that Garang was going around trying to line up financial and
                    political support. He said that I knew as well as anyone that we in Abidjan
                    couldn't deal with Garang on those issues, so I might as well meet with him and
                    hear what was on his mind.</p>
                <p>I didn't particularly want to meet with “Dr. John”, as some call him, because,
                    frankly - unlike some people - I had pretty ambivalent feelings about a guy who
                    would spend so many lives and generate so much misery over the issues disputed
                    between the SPLA and the Sudanese Government. How many lives are they worth?
                    During my time the SPLA had spilled more donor-NGO blood than the Government,
                    and that probably colored my view. But I did go and meet with him in his suite
                    at the Hotel Ivoire. And I did manage to shake his hand. And I did actually have
                    a pleasant conversation with him because he is an affable guy and an excellent
                    raconteur. He has a Ph. D. in Agricultural Economics from Iowa State and was on
                    the faculty of the University of Khartoum for several years. He is quite
                    charming.</p>
                <p>Because I didn't want to have a substantive discussion with him, I tried to keep
                    the conversation as general as possible. Somehow I got him started telling me
                    stories about various Sudanese personalities whom we both knew. He did tell me a
                    lot of stories that were really amusing about people who were in high positions
                    in the Sudanese government.</p>
                <p>Here's one of the more interesting stories he told me: Garang had been made a
                    Colonel in the Sudanese Army after he came in from “the bush”, probably in the
                    late 1970s. Not long afterwards he stopped overnight at the army base near
                    Kassala on his way to a training course in Port Sudan. After freshening up, he
                    went to the Officer's Club or Mess at about the cocktail hour. He walked up to
                    what he thought was a steward and ordered a drink. The man bowed and went off to
                    the bar. When the somewhat crowded room immediately went silent, Garang knew
                    that something was amiss and that it had something to do with him. He guessed,
                    accurately, that he had mistaken an officer in civilian dress for a servant (an
                    easy thing since “Suffragis”, or servants, usually wear the same white robes and
                    Turbans as Sudanese male guests). He decided that the best defense was an
                    offense. So he loudly addressed the mainly Northern officers and told them that
                    if he had made a mistake, he was sorry. But being new, he had no way of knowing
                    who was who so it was not fair to use his honest mistake to make him look
                    foolish or arrogant. The “Suffragi,” none other than General Burmah Nasser,
                    handed him his drink, welcomed him to the group and apologized for his
                    discomfort. They became good friends. That was only one of the stories he shared
                    over our two or so hour conversation.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>He had an idea that I could somehow help him with his wish that AID would provide
                    medium-term development-oriented assistance in SPLA-controlled areas. After
                    explaining that I had no role in deciding about such matters, I gave him a few
                    suggestions about how his movement might make it easier for the U.S. Government
                    to take steps in the directions he desired. For some time U.S. assistance to
                    populations in SPLA-controlled areas has been evolving in the direction he hoped
                    for.</p>
                <p>I mention my conversation with John Garang mainly to illustrate that the
                    relationship between Northerners and Southerners in Sudan is much more complex
                    and subtle than outsiders generally suppose. I wasn't in Sudan very long before
                    I began to realize that, despite the war between the SPLA and the government,
                    there were lots of genuine personal friendships that linked people on either
                    side in genuine and significant ways. I first became aware of it when I was in
                    the Minister of Finance' office after his return from negotiations with the
                    SPLM. He had a stack of letters from SPLM people for friends and relatives in
                    Khartoum. The southern leaders had been educated and had worked along side their
                    northern counterparts for years. There wsere and are still many southerners in
                    Khartoum working for the national government, including some Ministers. Some
                    SPLA figures certainly had extended family members in Khartoum, and I wouldn't
                    be surprised if some had immediate family members residing in Khartoum.
                    Something else that reflects the complexity of the conflict is that at least
                    half of the national army, including some of the generals fighting in the South,
                    were southerners during my time. I would be very surprised if that has changed
                    much. I saw many examples of northern-southern personal relationships' being
                    maintained despite the waalmost like Democrats and Republicans among us mostly
                    succeed in not letting that difference affect their personal relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Between northerners and southerners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, but particularly between rebels and government officials. It would
                    be oversimplification to say that there is racial hatred between the two sides.
                    I don't think that, and I never saw anything to suggest it. After all, most
                    Northerners from the West are as African in appearance as the southerners. But I
                    do think that northerners tend to think southerners are culturally backwarthat
                    they would be a lot better off if they were all Muslims, were sedentary herders
                    and farmers, spoke Arabic and adopted Arab folkways. They think that southerners
                    need to be under a kind of tutelage.</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>Many enlightened people wouldn't necessarily say that, but I think there are
                    these reflexes that are built into the system. And that is essentially what the
                    war was about. You know, it was over the extent to which the southern regions
                    could have their own legal framework, educational system and other institutions
                    as well as equal opportunities and equal status for southerners at the national
                    level. It was also about increasing the South's share of national revenue,
                    including potential oil revenue. As far as religion and religious practice was
                    concerned, it was about the southerners gaining exemption from Sharia law in the
                    North as well as in the South. Theywere already exempt from Sharia laws in the
                    South. (I remember noticing that liquor was sold openly in retail establishments
                    in Juba and served at official dinners at the Khartoum office of the Juba
                    Regional Government.) The war has not been about secession except that an
                    element among the Dinka bring it up from time to time. The rest of the
                    southerners don't want secession because that would put them under the
                    domination of the Dinka, who are largest tribe in the whole country. The aims
                    for which they are all fighting, and mostly making the civilian population die,
                    are quite complicated, even subtle. In some countries these goals would be
                    pursued by peaceful, nonviolent methods. Before the Islamist government took
                    over in 1989, they probably could have used nonviolent tactics without risking
                    more than jail. But, from that standpoint, the problem for the Southerners is
                    that they don't have much to nonviolently withhold from the northerners in order
                    to get their way. A lot of northerners think secession would be just fine as
                    long as the oil fields wind up on the Khartoum side of the new border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have extremists in the north? Were there extremist
                        factions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, but they were just a pressure group that the moderate government
                    had to deal with prior to the June 1989 coup. That coup represented a stealthy
                    power grab by the Muslim Brothers wheither covertly or overtlhad been a constant
                    force in both Egyptian and Sudanese politics. Their political party is called
                    the National Islamic Front (NIF) and was headed by Hassan Al-Turabi. They want
                    to establish a Muslim society under strict interpretations of Muslim law, with
                    either no rights or very slender rights for non-Muslims to live according to
                    non-Muslim laws and precepts. Most northern Sudanese are observant Muslims, but
                    not fundamentalists. It is very upsetting that the NIF, whose supporters and
                    sympathizers apparently never constituted more than about ten percent of the
                    population, managed to gain power through this 1989 coup.</p>
                <p>It was similar to what happened in Nazi Germany. In both countries a minority of
                    extremists gained political control. The Sudan case was different in that the
                    NIF came to power by a military coup whereas the Nazis gained power in Germany
                    through a combination of electoral success and political maneuvering. There was
                    another point of similarity as well. As previously in Germany, the Sudanese
                    general public has generally displayed moderation. Unfortunately, they have also
                    been politically passive like the Germans were. What political passions the
                    Sudanese can muster are expended more on questions of personalities and
                    loyalties than on ideas and ideology.</p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>This coup occurred at a point when we were already beginning to plan a scaling
                    back of development assistance. As I recall they were either in danger of
                    falling into Brooke status or had actually done so. It had been nip and tuck for
                    some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far had you gone with the planning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: We prepared a phase-out plan, but I can't remember whether we had done
                    that before the coup because of Brooke or only after the coup occurred. As you
                    know, a military coup requires termination of development assistance.</p>
                <p>But the coup had a bizarre aspect that I should mention</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: At first the coup seemed to be just a conventional African military
                    takeover on the part of a group within the military who simply wanted to end the
                    drift that pervaded government and politics. Their initial pronouncements
                    certainly sounded that way. They talked about creating order out of anarchy and
                    making things work again. And it was plausible since the elected government
                    couldn't seem to do much of anything, let alone anything right. Apart from the
                    Brooke question, we were beginning to question seriously whether we could
                    operate a development program in the climate of lassitude that prevailed.</p>
                <p>For a while the conventional wisdom in the diplomatic community was that the coup
                    had been masterminded by the Egyptians in hopes that the new regime would bring
                    the economy under improved management and negotiate an end to the war in the
                    South. But almost immediately, Sudanese contacts of ours began to come by our
                    offices and tell us that the coup makers were known to be Muslim Brothers. They
                    warned us that the coup- makers' agenda was to turn the country into another
                    Iran. These contacts were leading citizens from the University and the business
                    community (including the head of the largest public accounting firm in the
                    country). We in turn passed these assessments on to our Embassy. The Embassy
                    folks basically told us that they were hearing these allegations too, but
                    believed them to be false.</p>
                <p>Of course, our informants turned out to be correct. I don't know how long the
                    Embassy held to their position in their reporting to Washington, but I think it
                    was too long. I believe our Embassy held to the incorrect view about the
                    orientation of the military regime longer than most of the Western embassies. I
                    remember being informally asked months after the coup for my opinion on the
                    matter by people in AID and State in Washington who thought that the Embassy's
                    reporting on the subject was wrong.</p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>The only word I can say in the Embassy's defense is that the junta went to some
                    lengths to conceal their true character. Among other things, they threw Hassan
                    El Turabi, the leader of the NIF, in the pokey. They also appointed some
                    southern military officers, and at least one southern civilian, to key
                    positions. As I came to understand it later, the Egyptians had supported a coup
                    plot. They thought they were supporting a bunch of moderate people who were
                    going to put the country on a more businesslike track. But the Islamic
                    Fundamentalists were so clever that, in effect, they stole the coup from the
                    people whom the Egyptians thought they were supporting. And so the U.S. embassy
                    was taking its assurances from the Egyptians who themselves had been
                    bamboozled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At some point the decision was made to close out the
                        program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Once the coup occurred, no decision was needed about whether the
                    Sudanese were irretrievably in Brooke. There was no question but that there had
                    been a military coup, and, in that event, the law required us to end development
                    assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: So for the second time in my career, I found myself directing the
                    preparation of a phase-out plan for the development program. The humanitarian
                    program was unaffected. This plan had a shorter time frame, and I believe it was
                    nearly implemented by the time I left in June 1990. But, either directly or
                    indirectly, we were still responsible for a relief effort that cost on the order
                    of $100 million annually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was both emergency and program assistance and
                        projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Even before there was any question of phase-out, our development program
                    was declining as humanitarian assistance mounted. I believe our last development
                    program grant was made in 1987 or early 1988. I think we had annual PL 480 Title
                    I agreements at least through 1999. So that was Sudan.</p>
                <p>Oh, before we leave Sudan, I should mention one thing about air transport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't we have a plane in Sudan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, that's what I wanted to add. It was clear that, as the volume of
                    relief activity in the South expanded under OLS, there would be an increased
                    need to fly donor and NGO staff in and out of the relief areas. OFDA had already
                    bought an airplane for some previous emergency and offered to make it available
                    to USAID Khartoum. Thank goodness someone warned us that it would be a major
                    headache if we managed it, so we got UNICEF, who already operated an aircraft,
                    to take on that responsibility. They took responsibility for operating it as a
                    pooled resource and did an excellent job. As I recall, AirServe supplied the
                    crew and provided the requisite maintenance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was mainly related to relief operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, only for relief use.</p>
                <p>I feel very lucky to have had the experience working in Sudan during that period,
                    especially now that it's over. It is one of those things that you wouldn't want
                    to have missed, but you sure as hell wouldn't care to do it again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. I know exactly what you mean. Was there any lasting
                        effect of this massive program that we had for so long out there? How would
                        you characterize what may have become more ingrained in the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I believe that it had lasting effects on the capacities and
                    outlook of the Sudanese who were beneficiaries or otherwise associated with our
                    programs. We provided a lot of training both in the U.S. and in-country. We
                    trained a lot of economists. There are others whose approach to life and work
                    will always be different because of the interactions that we had, including
                    negotiations over things like CIP or PL480 Title I agreements, or the kind of
                    thinking that we shared in problem-solving situations.</p>
                <p>Joe Goodwin and Brian De Silva (a USDA PASA person) had laid out a series of
                    policy-related studies of the economics of irrigated agriculture that involved a
                    model. Most of the time I was there Brian was overseeing a team of ten to twenty
                    young masters or Ph.D.-level economists who were developing and then operating
                    this model. I think it was successful and turned out to be quite valuable on
                    several levels. It engaged these economists in working on a practical Sudanese
                    problem and gave them hands-on experience in applying their training. This is
                    only one example. The same thing happened in other sectors, such as energy
                    sector management. One of the last things we did was work with a team of
                    Sudanese technicians in using remote sensing to prepare land cover/bio-mass maps
                    of Southern Kordofan and Southern Darfur.</p>
                <p>Of course there are also a lot of people who were alive at the end of that period
                    who wouldn't have survived without the assistance provided by the U.S. and other
                    donors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Relief?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. Now, I don't know how many died in later crises, but I think in
                    general the relief programs since then have had more success because of
                    Operation Lifeline Sudan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It established an improved institutional framework?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, yes. It also elevated the profile of the effort through the
                    engagement of the UN system as well as the donors and NGOs at much higher levels
                    than previously. To take one small example Audrey Hepburn made a visit in her
                    role as special UNICEF ambassador. Mickey Leland, also a beautiful person in my
                    opinion, made several visits to Sudan. Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter made several
                    visits. These visits were partly emblematic of the Sudan emergency's higher
                    profile, but they were also helpful in themselves because they energized all
                    involved. They served to remind us that we were in the spotlight.</p>
                <p>That was some ten years ago and relief operations in the South have continued to
                    operate under the OLS banner ever since. Now those operations are mainly
                    operated from Nairobi and are more than previously focused on SPLA-held
                    territory. They have begun to incorporate primary health care, basic education
                    and agricultural interventions as well as conventional relief. Farmers are
                    receiving seed and inputs so that they can grow more food. Surplus food is being
                    bought from these farmers for relief use since this is more economical than
                    shipping it from further away. This is not a very important source of relief
                    food, but it provides an important incentive to the farmers. These interventions
                    have to be limited to avoid signaling support for the establishment for a new
                    African country, but they make sense in terms of both efficiency and
                    humanitarian criteria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But these things are being done in SPLA-controlled
                        areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, and it has had institutional development payoffs. The SPLA had a
                    relief arm that operated in the guise of an NGO called SRRA. These guys were
                    impossible. They were little better than a bunch of crude thugs - probably the
                    ones whom they couldn't trust under field conditions. The relief staff who dealt
                    with these guys in Nairobi and southern Sudan just despaired. But the SRRA has
                    become a much better organization. I recently met some SRRA staff and was
                    favorably impressed. The SRRA has gradually turned into an organization that the
                    relief community can work with. Once they have struck a bargain they can pretty
                    much be relied upon to stick to it. Their technical capacity has increased
                    greatly. They predicted the relief needs of 1997/98 more accurately than OLS and
                    the donors.It strikes me that Sudan was my only experience in a country where
                    the U.S. presence and the U.S. assistance program were heavily linked to Cold
                    War geo-strategic issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: And I can't think of a single program that didn't come to an untimely
                    end. It is too bad that we had to play those games. But I'm glad I witnessed one
                    of these cases.</p>
                <p>I mentioned that in CAR, where the leadership was about as poor as could be
                    imagined, there were a lot of good people trying to do the right thing. I
                    observed something similar in Sudan. There the quality of the individuals in the
                    public service was quite high, but the overall condition of the civil and
                    military administrations was just amazingly chaotic. Anarchy rained.</p>
                <p>But you know it almost reminds me of these accounts by Primo Levy and Elie Wiesel
                    of life in concentration camps during World War II. Almost everywhere you find
                    people who are working sincerely and diligently to do the right thing - often in
                    situations where they get penalized for it rather than rewarded. Chaos and
                    crisis bring out the worst in some people and the best in others.</p>
                <p>One personality who comes to mind in this context is the Governor of Kordofan
                    whose name I can't recall. He was instrumental in helping to get food down to
                    the Dinka areas of southern Kordofan where large numbers of starving displaced
                    were gathering in 1988. A donor-NGO delegation accompanied by the Governor of
                    Kordofan flew to Babanusa in Southern Kordofan to go from there by train to
                    Muglad and El Meiram. That was a very vivid and upsetting experience.</p>
                <p>We had the clearance of the authorities in Khartoum. The Governor of Kordofan
                    went with us to see the situation personally and also, I suspect, because he
                    knew that he needed to be there to run interference. Everyone was very polite,
                    but one didn't have to be very sensitive to realize that we weren't welcome.
                    There was all manner of foot dragging and obfuscation by military officers and
                    railway officials. But finally after a great deal of palaver, including some
                    fairly stern interventions by the Governor, we managed to reach an understanding
                    that the train would leave at something like midnight.</p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>The Governor was from Babanusa so we went to his place for dinner before going to
                    the train somewhat early for the departure. Most of us found comfortable places
                    on the train, and I fell asleep. The next thing I remember is hearing voices
                    raised in anger and noting that the train was stationary. I staggered outside to
                    find the Governor throwing a pea green fit because the train crew had gone home
                    and left word that they would return the next morning. The Governor personally
                    commandeered some railway vehicles, went to the railway manager's house, and,
                    with him reluctantly in tow, went around rousting out the railway crew. We left
                    several hours late, but much earlier than the train crew intended - especially
                    since they probably didn't plan to leave at the hour they had specified. These
                    guys had thought that they could overrule the governor of this province
                    notwithstanding the fact that he represented the authority of the state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they didn't want to go because of the fears of militia
                        or were they just...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Maybe the fear of the militia had something to do with it, but the
                    militia in question were progovernment militias and you would think that they
                    would be afraid to disobey the Governor also. Whatever it was, this kind of
                    behavior occurred all the time. No one was indisputably in charge of anything in
                    Sudan. Every service and administrative unit in the public sector behaved as if
                    it were sovereign. I think it's plausible that the railway people wanted to
                    stick to their own plans and schedules. Maybe they just didn't want to take the
                    trip. I suppose they were aware of opposition to the trip. The army probably
                    didn't want us down there looking into the humanitarian nightmare that they had
                    done little to mitigate. We walked into a terrible situation there. A girl about
                    8 years old girl dropped dead right in front of my eyes and there were all
                    manner of people around who looked a lot worse than she did. You knew that a lot
                    of them were going to die of disease or outright starvation no matter how hard
                    the international community tried to prevent it. I think all of us felt torn
                    between staying there to lend a hand (about all we could have done was hold the
                    hands of the afflicted) and doing what we really had to do, which was to return
                    to Khartoum and do everything we could to engineer a more forthcoming and
                    systematic response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you delivered food on this train?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: We had some food and other relief supplies with us that we were taking
                    to the two or three NGOs who were on the scene trying to do what they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long a train trip was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Probably no more than a hundred miles through countryside that was
                    supposedly in government hands, but one never quite knew. The train couldn't go
                    very fast because the rail bed was in bad shape from the flooding and it took
                    about eight hours. There were a lot of stops.</p>
                <p>But for all the Sudanese who were bad actors or feckless, there were also plenty
                    who were super good individually. I have a hard time understanding how people
                    manage to live in a society like that. It must be pretty trying. I'm afraid they
                    become inured to injustice, misery and plain evil on a scale far beyond any
                    response that they can conceive. Sudanese society is extremely fragmented along
                    ethnic, clan and family lines. This extends into the modern sector where loyalty
                    flows to public service organizations and private sector professions and sectors
                    that people are affiliated with. This fragmentation means that they can only
                    form a consensus on the broadest of issues, and political action is only likely
                    when the modern sector groups (e.g., professional associations of groups like
                    doctors, engineers, teachers, etc.) provide the leadership, as occurred in
                    response to Nimeiri's excesses. It's sad that this leads most Sudanese be
                    politically apathetic about a wide range of issues. The regime's extreme
                    ruthlessness discourages the exercise of leadership, and apathy prevails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we stop there? At this point you left
                        Sudan and were transferred to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A new role as Director of the USAID Regional Economic Development Service Office
                    (REDSO) in the Ivory Coast - 1990-1993</p>
                <p>GILBERT: To the REDSO for West and Central Africa in Abidjan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what year was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: This was summer of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for those who don't understand, describe a little
                        bit about what REDSO is or was when you joined it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: The REDSO idea arose back in the early 1970s when David Shear was at the
                    Senior Seminar. As part of his work there he wrote a “think piece” on how a
                    regional office in West Africa could strengthen AID project management in the
                    field. This led to the establishment of the first REDSO in Abidjan, and he was
                    its first Director beginning in about 1974. REDSO stands for Regional Economic
                    Development Services Office. It had two classic field office support
                    functions.</p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>One was to provide technical support both to large and fully delegated posts (or
                    missions) and to smaller posts without full delegations. For the missions, the
                    support usually consisted of lawyers and other highly specialized experts who
                    are not numerous enough, or needed often enough, to be in every mission. For the
                    smaller posts REDSO provided a much broader array of technical staff
                    support.</p>
                <p>The other function had to do with the non-fully-delegated posts. Posts that don't
                    have full delegations of authority are usually headed by AID Representatives or
                    AID Affairs Officers. In these cases, REDSO participated in major project
                    planning and management decisions. So, when these missions had thought through
                    what they wanted to do (often with the help of REDSO staff), the REDSO Director
                    had to concur in the required decision. During my time in REDSO and for at least
                    the previous ten years, approval authority for most projects was included among
                    those authorities delegated to full missions. The principle officers of the
                    non-fully-delegated posts could exercise the authorities delegated to full
                    missions only with the concurrence of the REDSO Director.</p>
                <p>A third, nonstandard function that fell to both REDSOs (the other is in Nairobi
                    for East and Southern Africa) was direct program management. This mostly
                    involved responsibility for regional projects until REDSO/WCA became responsible
                    for management of an Ivory Coast bilateral program inaugurated in FY1990.</p>
                <p>After the phase-down in Sudan, REDSO/WCA was the largest AID management unit in
                    Sub-Sahara Africa. I felt blessed among REDSO Directors because of my
                    responsibility for the Ivory Coast bilateral program. This was unprecedented,
                    and it greatly enriched my years in Abidjan.</p>
                <p>When I arrived, I found that the REDSO wasn't performing any of its assigned
                    functions to my satisfaction. My main concern was that there was no clear
                    distinction between the staff responsible for supporting client posts as opposed
                    to those responsible for direct program management. Many units and staff had
                    responsibility for a little of each function. So, figuratively, on Tuesdays and
                    Thursdays these people felt they were too occupied with direct program
                    management to meet their client post support responsibilities. And on Mondays,
                    Wednesdays and Fridays they couldn't do program management because they were too
                    busy with client post support. The upshot was that nobody was really accountable
                    for either thing. This caused us to look fickle to our client posts and
                    sometimes we were.</p>
                <p>Of course, some of the best staff managed somehow to meet both kinds of
                    responsibilities. For these folks the problem was to prevent them from working
                    themselves half to death or neglecting their families too much because of
                    travel. But there was an essential conflict of interest in having people
                    constantly torn between tending their own patches versus those of our clients,
                    and I decided to resolve it.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>The other thing that worried me was that, unlike REDSO/ECA (East and Southern
                    Africa) in Nairobi, REDSO/WCA was not regarded as a particularly superior
                    resource within its region. Others and I had observed that East and Southern
                    Africa Missions vied with one another to secure involvement by the best
                    REDSO/ESA staff in their program and sector strategy development work. This
                    added strength to these functions and paid off in program quality. Although
                    certain staff of REDSO/WCA had been in great demand from time to time, their
                    work had been overwhelmingly project-focused and there hadn't been the kind of
                    partnership in program conceptualization that existed between REDSO/ESA and its
                    client bilateral posts. It seemed clear to me that we needed to recruit staff
                    who were leaders in their fields or had the ability to achieve such standing.
                    This problem had come up in my discussions with the Africa Bureau leadership
                    during my pre-departure briefings, and they wanted to see REDSO/WCA's
                    relationship with its clients evolve in the ESA direction. The recruitment of
                    higher-powered staff in certain functions may not have arisen because that need
                    wasn't apparent to me until I had been in Abidjan for a while.</p>
                <p>To resolve the conflict of interest and lack of accountability problems, I got
                    Washington's agreement to a restructuring that gave us a program management
                    division, which was functionally like an AID Rep's office. It had responsibility
                    for coordinating the design and implementation of all programs that REDSO was
                    directly responsible for. Like client posts, our Program Management Office
                    didn't have all the staff needed for all of its functions. They were required to
                    bid for REDSO services and were treated pretty much like the client posts at the
                    annual scheduling conferences that we held in the fall of each year. After a few
                    teething problems it worked quite well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this for Ivory Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. For the Ivory Coast bilateral program and a fairly large regional
                    project that provided technical and institution-building assistance to the
                    African Development Bank. We also had some responsibility for field coordination
                    of one or two regional projects managed in Washington, and I can't remember for
                    sure whether I left these responsibilities in the technical divisions. I think I
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Another thing I did was to change some position descriptions and merge some
                    functions into a single unit for synergy's sake. We combined the agriculture,
                    environmental, Food for Peace, private sector development and economics staffs
                    into an Office of Productive Sector Development headed by a very strong and
                    energetic agricultural economist. This made sense to me because the vast bulk of
                    our non-project assistance was driven by agriculture sector, agricultural and
                    non-traditional export, private sector development and environmental policy
                    reform agendas. We grouped the health and human resources staff into one
                    division called the Health, Population and Human Resources Office. We also
                    beefed up the Project Development Office and moved into that office the
                    engineers who had previously been located in a large General Development
                    Office.</p>
                <p>And then, in order to get the agricultural economist mentioned above as well as
                    other superior staff, I devoted an hour or two a day for a year or more to
                    working with Washington colleagues in identifying strong candidates and
                    recruiting them. There had been quite a number of vacancies when I arrived. And
                    some of the restructuring decisions I made created new vacancies. With a good
                    deal of help from colleagues in Washington (Merle Mukai in AFR/MGT and Cynthia
                    Rozell, the Deputy Director of AFR/WA) we gradually brought the staff of REDSO
                    up to full strength. I think almost anybody who knew the situation would agree
                    that, for the most part, the new people were superior resources in their field.
                    As a result we began to get involved more and more in the early analysis and
                    conceptualization work that underlay sector strategy development and project
                    selection. This meant that the quality of project ideas began to improve, and we
                    were less often required to help make “silk purses out of sows' ears.”</p>
                <p>This was, in itself, quite satisfying. However, I never got more than backhanded
                    praise from my “elders and betters” in Washington (who, within six months of my
                    arrival in Abidjan, were no longer those who had selected me for the job and
                    given me guidance). On one hand I remember mention in my EERs that I was “a
                    total quality manager.” On the other hand, I got signals that I was not paying
                    enough attention to EEO considerations in my recruitment efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the geographic coverage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: REDSO/WCA's geographic coverage extends from Mauritania down to Zaire
                    along the coast of West and Central Africa and inward to the Sahel countries,
                    including Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including some countries with little or no program, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. And you know there are about six or seven full missions and roughly
                    an equal number of non-fully delegated posts. That picture changed, of course,
                    during my three plus years. The programs in Cameroon and Mauritania were phased
                    out. And towards the end of my time, the Ivory Coast program had to be phased
                    out beginning about when I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: There are two levels of answers to that question. The real answer, I
                    think, is that the Ivorians were on the U.N. Security Council beginning somewhat
                    before my arrival in Abidjan and ending about when I left. If the end of Ivory
                    Coast's term on the Security Council wasn't enough to cause phase-out of the
                    bilateral program, it certainly made the program vulnerable. And that's where
                    the second level answer to your question comes in. Sometime during 1993 the new
                    administration of AID decided that the number of country programs had to be
                    reduced by phasing out field posts. Ivory Coast was put on that list. I frankly
                    don't recall that any coherent, explicit reasons were given. I seem to recall
                    that the stated reasons always pertained to the affected countries as a group.
                    Some things that were mentioned were the desire to reduce the number of AID
                    presence countries, to work in countries where human rights as well as democracy
                    and governance issues were being addressed and where policy reforms were
                    empowering and energizing the private sector. I didn't put too much credence in
                    these rationales' explanatory power concerning the Ivory Coast decision because
                    programs were being continued in countries where the picture in each of these
                    areas was less positive than in Ivory Coast. The fact of Ivory Coast's
                    relatively high per capita income was not mentioned. Another factor that wasn't
                    mentioned was that this was yet another country that was slipping in and out of
                    Brooke status. And there was little prospect of their staying out of Brooke
                    without non-project assistance from the U.S. roughly equal to the annual cost of
                    servicing their debts to the U.S. government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Mauritania and Cameroon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, in Cameroon it had a lot to do with the fact that neither human
                    rights nor democracy and governance were faring well. And, those who were close
                    to the situation agreed that it probably had a lot to do with the fact that
                    Brian Atwood was snubbed by the Cameroonians when he was Director of the
                    National Democratic Institute (NDI) and that body was trying to get that
                    Government to run free and fair elections. Again, except for having the bad
                    judgment to stiff the NDI, Cameroon was not worse in democracy-governance than a
                    number of other African countries that continued to receive U.S. assistance.
                    Moreover, as a development partner, it deserved quite high marks for
                    seriousness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Mauritania?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>GILBERT: As for the Mauritania phase-out, I think that wasn't a bad decision.
                    Mauritania is not a real country by twentieth century standards. It's just so
                    damn hard to do anything there. And nothing stays done for more than three weeks
                    before it falls apart. We had a number of programs there that were good in terms
                    of their own internal logic, but they seemed to get engulfed in the pervading
                    futility. Implementation dragged because counterpart personnel and government
                    priorities constantly changed. The government suffered from an organizational
                    attention deficit disorder. In individual human beings that condition is often
                    aggravated by hyperactivity, but the Government of Mauritania suffers from the
                    opposite problem, “hypoactivity.” So even when its attention straggled back to a
                    particular project, action was not the likely result. Government is more or less
                    suspended for a few weeks every year during a traditional festival of the “new
                    dates” when most of the Moors drift back to their oases.</p>
                <p>But our tolerance of the way things “work” in Mauritania might have gone on
                    indefinitely if the Mauritanians hadn't shot themselves in the foot during the
                    run-up to the Gulf War by allowing Saddam Hussein to park a large part of his
                    national air fleet there for the duration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there projects that you were involved in or that
                        REDSO had a major role in during your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, we were involved all across the region in providing technical and
                    program management support to the whole gamut of the programs that the smaller
                    posts were conducting and to a large part of the full Missions' programs. But
                    there was significant variation among the full missions in their reliance on
                    REDSO. The Senegal mission tended not to wish much REDSO involvement. They even
                    contrived to get their own lawyer. Mali, Niger, Guinea and, to a lesser extent,
                    Ghana made considerable use of REDSO services. Cameroon also did so to some
                    extent. These larger, fully-delegated, “Schedule A” posts mainly called on us
                    for the specialized staff which they lacked such as lawyers, engineers, private
                    sector development specialists and environmental officers.</p>
                <p>Our best customers remained the smaller, not-fully delegated, “Schedule B” posts
                    like Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, Benin and Cape Verde. In addition to the types
                    of staff the Schedule A countries used, they also drew heavily on our project
                    design officers and our sector development staff. I also should record that one
                    of our contracting officers, Steve Wisecarver, was frequently invited to
                    participate in design exercises. The ostensible reason was that they wanted help
                    in preparing with contract scopes-of-work (SOWs) so that implementation would
                    start right away following project authorization. But I eventually realized that
                    these requests also reflected client posts' desire for his participation in the
                    design process. In working through the principal SOWs with the design team he
                    usually helped them to improve the design.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>Our main area of involvement in client posts' programs was in the agriculture and
                    natural resources sector. The head of the Productive Sector Development group
                    was Paul Crawford. He was an agricultural economist with excellent program
                    strategy planning and design skills. Another member of that group, the Private
                    Sector Development Advisor, Oren Whyche, was extremely capable. The two of them
                    as well as our environmental and natural resource management specialists (an
                    American and a Senegalese) were in great demand. The demand for help with
                    nontraditional export development projects was so great that we recruited an
                    Israeli expert, Shaul Horan, just to help with that.</p>
                <p>We also provided a lot of support to countries in the area of health and family
                    planning. Our best and most sought after technical staff members in this field
                    were people from the region. We had a Senegalese AIDS expert who I fully expect
                    in ten or fifteen years to hear about being in a high-level job at the World
                    Health Organization or UNICEF.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: His name is Suleiman Barry. We had regional people of almost equal
                    caliber as economists, educationists, environmentalists, engineers, and primary
                    health services experts. Suleiman Berry was the most sought, but the regionals
                    were at least as sought after as their American counterparts. And the credit
                    goes to Chuck De Bose. When he was the head of the General Development Office he
                    spent a lot of time before my arrival identifying and recruiting these folks. We
                    continued the process after he left, but we only had a very few positions left
                    to fill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't De Bose also your Health Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. He was a Health Officer by profession, and functioned in that
                    capacity while also heading up the General Development Office. Though he found
                    and recruited most of the regional staff, I feel a sense of shared
                    accomplishment regarding the key role they came to play. When they first came on
                    board they were slow to appreciate the role we intended for them. I'm sure that
                    Chuck or others never gave them to understand that their role was to be one of
                    simply doing as they were told. But they acted as if this were the case. They
                    came from professional and administrative environments where initiatives, ideas
                    and, above all, decisions flowed down and where such things were not open to a
                    much discussion, let alone to being questioned.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>We held a lot of technical review meetings for the purpose of framing REDSO
                    positions on project design, authorization and major implementation decisions
                    that were submitted for my concurrence. Given the number of countries and the
                    complexities involved there was no way we could do this responsibly without
                    making this a staff-work process under the coordination of the head of the
                    Project Development and Engineering Office subject to final review by the Deputy
                    Director and myself. Full participation of the concerned technical staff was
                    essential to reaching sound decisions. We seldom, if ever, said “No” in the end,
                    but we often required changes in order to concur.</p>
                <p>As you know, meetings of this type can get pretty lively and ours were no
                    exception. We insisted that these folks attend meetings on matters in their
                    technical areas even though at the beginning they often had little prior
                    exposure to the specific activity under review. After discussions went back and
                    forth for a time on the various points, we would ask them what they thought.
                    Initially, they were almost always shocked into speechlessness. Once they knew
                    what to expect, they were merely resigned and miserable at the prospect. In
                    their earliest responses, they would initially agree with what others or the
                    senior person present had last said. But gradually they observed that everyone
                    was more or less equal in these discussions or, at least, that staff didn't
                    particularly hesitate to differ with their seniors, including me, on points of
                    fact or interpretation - even outside their particular specialties. We also
                    insisted that they join in calling us by our first names and be called by theirs
                    (not an easy thing for Francophones). At the end of the meetings they could see
                    that the senior person present would formulate a recommended decision that may
                    or not be based on a consensus and that the differences in the meeting seldom
                    affected relationships outside the meeting. They saw that the senior officers
                    generally accepted well-reasoned recommendations of the staff, and that if we
                    didn't we would explain why.</p>
                <p>Finally, through a process that combined pushing and handholding we got them to
                    function as regular members of the REDSO staff. The process of getting there was
                    fun to watch. The underlying change in mental posture helped them to succeed in
                    practicing their specialties on their own at client posts.</p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>Oren Whyche, our senior private sector advisor, spoke wonderful French. She had
                    held a number of professional positions in the U.S. banking sector, but one of
                    her more formative experiences was working as a Zaire Airlines stewardess for
                    some years. She had lived in Africa on and off for years. Needless to say, she
                    knew her way around. In addition, she was a dazzlingly smart and articulate
                    expert person with an extremely positive personality and an incredible work
                    ethic. She became the primary media personality not only in REDSO, but in the
                    whole U.S. Mission. She was frequently in demand to appear on television and
                    radio to explain how private sector economies worked as well as the care and
                    feeding they required. About every six or nine months she would become
                    physically exhausted and have to kind of drop her frenetic schedule for a week
                    or so. We tried to get her to take it a bit easier and succeeded to some extent,
                    but we couldn't “just say no” for her against her will and without her
                    cooperation. We had similar problems, but to a lesser degree, with our strongest
                    staff members.</p>
                <p>While REDSO Director, I was mindful of some dangerous tendencies that we had to
                    avoid. One important one, to which REDSO had sometimes fallen prey in the past,
                    was to consider itself mandated to micromanage or impose program decisions on
                    the Schedule B posts. Even though it had been some years since I had witnessed
                    or heard of a REDSO Director taking that kind of approach, I was on guard to
                    prevent this kind of thinking from creeping into REDSO's work and communications
                    with the client posts. The philosophy that I preached at regular intervals to my
                    colleagues was that we were not there to ensure that each post's decisions were
                    the same that we would make. Rather a REDSO concurrence should reflect our
                    finding that a referred decision was defensible in light of USAID policy and
                    regulations; of economic, social and technical soundness criteria; and of the
                    relevant legislative framework.</p>
                <p>We did more than apply “stink” tests. But, in our efforts to achieve high quality
                    decisions, we bore in mind that there is usually more than one decision that a
                    reasonable person can make on a given matter. We focused our thinking on
                    parameters and degrees of acceptability. When we sent comments back to the
                    client post we would explain the changes we recommended and distinguish them
                    from those that we required in order to concur.</p>
                <p>My concept was that REDSO's mission was both to ensure a “requisite quality” of
                    program decision-making and to apply our resources to raising the attained
                    quality as high as possible. But we couldn't do the latter by constantly jerking
                    the client posts around. Instead it had to be our aim to build partnerships with
                    these posts so that we could make our inputs throughout the process of
                    developing and implementing activities.</p>
                <p>Part of that strategy was to assure that our people were leaders in their fields
                    as well as disciplined and service-oriented in their work with the client posts.
                    Another was to let the REDSO review process be fairly transparent so that they
                    could see that it was a staff process rather than just me substituting my
                    judgment for that of the client principal officer. The payoff was that we had
                    increasingly productive working relations with the client posts. When we
                    occasionally disagreed, the quality of our disagreements was quite high.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular program or development policy
                        directions that you were responsible for or were asked to pursue or
                        promote?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: None, except to make sure that programs were developed and managed along
                    sound lines. All of us in the region received the same guidance about policy and
                    program priorities, including the new initiatives. Democratization and
                    governance was one thrust that was getting great emphasis. Two others were
                    nontraditional export promotion and HIV/AIDS. We added experts to our staff in
                    each of these three areas. But I didn't see myself as some kind of Pope or Moses
                    to serve as (and be seen as posing as) shepherd of the WCA flock. I'm sorry to
                    say that my Deputy used to search through everything that came out of Washington
                    for policy trends or shifts that might provide us an opportunity to “exercise
                    leadership” on some issue or initiative. The ideas he came up with seemed pretty
                    lame to me. I came down on that like a ton of bricks. It raises my hackles just
                    to think about it even now. Without a compelling need, this would have amounted
                    to role seeking or, more bluntly, posturing. It would also have impaired our
                    working relations with our client posts.</p>
                <p>My view was that our leadership role was to be “apostles” of USAID
                    professionalism and that our job was to encourage and promote it through helping
                    the client posts in the region realize their programmatic visions. This meant
                    supplying specialized manpower and, for the Schedule B posts, participating in
                    technical and program managerial decision-making. As the quality of our staff
                    increased we would become increasingly involved in strategy development and
                    project selection. But that would not happen if we were perceived as trying to
                    make ourselves look good at our clients' expenswith us as leaders and innovators
                    and them as less enlightened followers. Besides that would have been unfair to
                    the leadership of the client posts. Generally, they were our equals in most ways
                    except that they lacked staff resources and, especially, the specialized or
                    highly experienced and trained staff that REDSO had.</p>
                <p>But we did some things that nobody asked of us. We stuck like flypaper to the
                    Liberian humanitarian emergency. We monitored not only the emergency but also
                    the assistance that went to Liberia and to the refugees from Liberia and Sierra
                    Leone located in neighboring countries of Guinea and Ivory Coast. And again,
                    even though we were occasionally asked to take certain actions in relation to
                    those situations, we never got any encouragement to monitor that situation or
                    thanks for doing so. But some of our staff and I had been involved in other
                    emergency situations and knew damn well that if the Liberia emergency program
                    and related refugee programs went south, people would murmur their dismay that
                    REDSO had let that happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues that you had to deal with? What
                        did you see as your biggest problems and opportunities? I guess you have
                        touched on them to some extent.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, one special role for REDSO was non-explicit. The concern I felt
                    about keeping in touch with the Liberia and related emergencies was not just
                    based on my experience in past emergencies, but also on my observation that we
                    were just expected to be in touch with what was going on in the region both in
                    the bilateral AID posts and in various regional institutions. So we encouraged
                    staff to pay courtesy calls on the secretariats of these bodies. Keeping in
                    touch with the atmosphere and organizational health of client posts was pretty
                    easy regarding the Schedule B posts, but harder where the Schedule A posts were
                    concerned. Doing so depended in part on my also getting around to client posts
                    from time to time. I didn't need Washington's permission to travel but I did
                    need post clearances. Of course, this was most difficult to get form posts with
                    problems because these would, as often as not, be associated with a touch of
                    paranoia on the part of a principal officer who felt “beleaguered.” My approach
                    was consistent with discussions I had with the Africa Bureau leadership that had
                    been in place when I was en route to Abidjan. I made a point of getting around
                    to as many posts as possible on a more or less routine basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you supposed to report back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Not formally. I would usually tie visits to something interesting and
                    innovative that was going on at one or more posts. I would sometimes do a little
                    report on the activity or event for Washington and the other WCA posts. I felt
                    that this was useful because it was always nicer for the client posts if someone
                    else tooted their horn, and weak Ambassadors are sometimes disinclined to
                    recognize or even understand really creative contributions by AID staff. Other
                    times I would simply write an informal letter or note either to the principal
                    officer or the DAA giving a perspective on the work a client post was doing. I
                    very seldom “carried tales.” When I did it was about situations where a problem
                    could result in serious consequences. At any post there is usually something to
                    gossip about, but I don't recall learning of more than two or three untoward
                    situations that I thought should be communicated to anyone in Washington. Part
                    of my reasoning was that bad news travels fast and there was no particular
                    reason for me to assume any but a very few situations would not get back to the
                    geographic office in rather short order. However, I occasionally got calls from
                    Washington asking me what I knew or thought about a given situation. Hopefully,
                    I was able to offer some insights and give added perspective on those
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem maintaining morale given that
                        people had to be traveling so much?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Morale needs attention at any Foreign Service post, but the REDSOs in
                    both Abidjan and Nairobi had a history of problems in that area. REDSO duty is
                    likely to be hard on all the staff involved in servicing client posts. It is
                    particularly hard on mediocre or weak staff. A REDSO assignment requires staff
                    to be “under the gun” much of the time. Some people thrive on deadlines and
                    having to make written and/or verbal recommendations that realistically
                    addressed concrete problems, but others can't do it or can't sustain it. A
                    number of people who couldn't deal with that kind of pressure engaged in evasive
                    behavior. One ploy was to make arrangements for client posts to request them for
                    well or thinly disguised routine tasks. Another was to find reasons for not
                    traveling. Of course, some of our staff just weren't in much demand. REDSO duty
                    was also difficult on people with fragile family situations or who didn't cope
                    well with travel.</p>
                <p>Client posts were asked to report on the contributions made by REDSO staff. For
                    most of our staff, this made up the bulk of the content of their annual PERs. So
                    morale was poor among the 10 or so percent of our staff who couldn't or wouldn't
                    deliver. For the staff who could handle the travel, whose family situations
                    didn't pose a problem, who performed well and who were in high demand, REDSO
                    tours offered professional fulfillment and advanced their careers. But even for
                    this group REDSO duty posed problems arising from scheduling pressures, the
                    challenge of achieving a reasonable balance between their professional and
                    family responsibilities and the need for a modicum of rest and relaxation.</p>
                <p>Both Nairobi and Abidjan, being big cosmopolitan cities with all manner of
                    diversions for those who could cope, were in themselves hazards to morale. The
                    reason is that those who were comfortable with the cross-cultural setting would
                    pretty much go their own ways. This meant that the kinds of community
                    activities, including reciprocal home entertaining, that brought people together
                    at more challenging posts were either absent or under-subscribed.</p>
                <p>At the beginning, morale in some circles within REDSO was pretty low. And, as I
                    began to clarify roles and responsibilities on one hand and break up various
                    little unbusinesslike arrangements on the other, it got worse for a time. Some
                    people cleared out, which was just fine if they couldn't “get with the program.”
                    But, before long, morale began to improve. I encouraged managers to stay in
                    touch with the families of people who were traveling and would try myself to do
                    this where I saw a need. I made a point of entertaining the staff at our house
                    and organizing get-togethers for both employees and family members whenever the
                    least excuse presented itself. This eventually led to more and more community
                    activity that we didn't initiate. Jane and I made a point of never turning down
                    invitations unless we had no choice. That could be pretty taxing sometimes, but
                    we had both learned the art of the power nap.</p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>We were also really fortunate that the Ambassador, Ken Brown, and his DCM, Gerry
                    Hamilton, were determined to do everything they could to promote a sense of
                    community within the larger U.S. Mission. A lot of Embassy staff had regional
                    responsibilities also and faced the same challenges to morale. Apart from being
                    extremely approachable and friendly, Brown and Hamilton communicated by every
                    word, look and gesture that they considered all of udirect-hires and
                    contractorto be part of one official family. One very concrete thing they did
                    was insist that USAID and other agencies represented at post be given the same
                    treatment as State Department staff in the assignment of housing and the
                    provision of GSO services.</p>
                <p>I mentioned the ten or twelve high-powered regional technical staff who were in
                    such demand by client posts, but in addition to them we had lots regional
                    professionals in the West Africa Accounting Center (WAAC) and some in the
                    Executive Office of REDSO. We made a point of encouraging these people to attend
                    REDSO community social events. Their lives being more complicated, they attended
                    at a much lower rate that the U.S. staff. However, the social barrier decreased
                    markedly through time. One thing that greatly helped was that one of the WAAC
                    staff ran a small establishment called “Chez Willy's.” A lot of the singleboth
                    American and regionawould go there for beer and snacks after work. Willy, like
                    many in the WAAC, was a Ghanaian.</p>
                <p>I believe that within about six months of my arrival morale was quite good and
                    that it stayed that way throughout the remainder of my time in Abidjan.</p>
                <p>Ivory Coast</p>

                <p>GILBERT: The largest item was an ESF cash grant for debt repayment designed to
                    keep them out of Brooke status. They had been on the brink of going into Brooke
                    for some time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That's right. Much of the rationalization was based on the steps they
                    were taking toward economic reform.</p>

                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. The World Bank was working with them on rehabilitating the coffee
                    and cocoa sectors. The program included opening up agricultural markets,
                    de-confining input markets, etc. We were not involved in that dialogue, nor did
                    we even track it systematically.</p>

                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No. My understanding was that (except perhaps in the most unusual
                    circumstances, e.g. the Israel cash grant, for instance) it is important to
                    establish for the record that the cash grant was used for something that the
                    U.S. supports. If for no other reason, this has the benefit of dispelling
                    possible claims by critics that the funds supported host government spending of
                    a frivolous or repressive character. Servicing of debts to the U.S. government
                    was what we wanted the Government to use the money for and it served a
                    purposalbeit a political more than an economic one, but remember these were ESF
                    funds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That wasn't illegal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I was pretty surprised at the whole idea. I don't think I would
                    have had the nerve to suggest it myself. But this is a reminder that dubious is
                    one thing and illegal is another. I can't remember whether it was authorized in
                    Washington or in Abidjan, but the lawyers were fully involved both in Washington
                    and in Abidjan. It was notified to Congress. Negotiating it with the Government
                    was one of the first things I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this generate counterpart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't even ask for counterpart?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>GILBERT: No. That was one of the first things I thought of when I heard of the
                    idea. By then I had acquired a lot of experience in programming counterpart and
                    U.S.-owned local currencies. We were planning to launch one or two technical
                    assistance projects and entr� into the Ivorian development budget allocation
                    process would have been helpful. But AID/W had thought that through and was dead
                    set against it. They wanted the cash grant to be quickly disbursed and done
                    with. But it wasn't just a matter of their view of the Ivory Coast cash grant.
                    There had been a rethinking of counterpart funding issues following a finding by
                    some entitprobably GAO - that AID must take more accounting responsibility for
                    counterpart currencies than it wanted. Also, I think AID/Washington had been
                    exasperated to find in several cases that their intent of scaling back field
                    operations and activities by cutting appropriated budgets had been frustrated in
                    cases where posts had substantial U.S.-owned and counterpart currencies.)</p>
                <p>Before going on, let me note that we planned to make additional cash grants in
                    FYs 1991 and 1992 in amounts similar to the $7 to 10 million that we provided in
                    1990. I think we did so in 1991, but I'm pretty sure we didn't in 1992.</p>
                <p>We developed two bilateral projects also. One was a health and family planning
                    program that was pretty ambitious. It was budgeted at something like seven or
                    eight million dollars over a number of years. One component expanded the
                    availability of family planning services in key locations around the country.
                    Though typically located in health facilities, the services provided were mostly
                    straightforward, “bare-naked” contraception. There was tacit support for doing
                    this, but I don't believe there was an explicit family planning or population
                    policy. We implemented this program through a grant to the premier Ivorian
                    private family planning NGO called AIBEF (Ivorian Association for Family
                    Well-Being). From the time we authorized that project until we could get that
                    outfit “certified”, we spent a fair amount of money for, and devoted at least
                    six months to, financial management technical assistance and training provided
                    by a big eight accounting firm before their management systems and professional
                    staffing were judged adequate to manage the funds that they would be receiving
                    from us. Within about 90 days of our providing the certification that enabled us
                    to begin disbursing the grant, two of their accountants ran off with a
                    substantial pile of money (maybe $40,000). Of course, the certification was
                    technically correct. Adequate financial controls don't prevent embezzlement;
                    they merely discourage it by making it difficult to hide for any length of time.
                    But this was discouraging, and it slowed project implementation considerably. It
                    also illustrates one of the reasons why it is difficult for AID to support local
                    NGOs directly. Most simply can't meet financial certification requirements.
                    That's why AID often makes grants to them through American PVOs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an effective program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, it was on the way to being effective. I don't think there was any
                    question of the demand for the services, and meeting that demand was pretty
                    straightforward business. Given the supplies, there were plenty of Ivorian
                    doctors, nurses and midwives who were capable of delivering the services. I
                    think it would have eventually turned out to be an effective program. But it
                    never got fully up and running before I left at the end of 1993.</p>
                <p>There was also an HIV/AIDS control element to this project. It operated through
                    another local NGO called ESPOIR (Hope). It operated an HIV testing and
                    counseling center. There was an Ivorian nurse or doctor who ran its day-to-day
                    operations. There were also some Belgian nuns who contributed. One of the nuns
                    was HIV positive due to a blood transfusion. These were saintly people who did a
                    great deal of good in getting people to guard against HIV or, if they had it, to
                    protect others from catching it from them. Another part of the combined
                    anti-HIV/family planning project was a social marketing of condoms activity run
                    by PSI (Population Services International). They did an excellent job of
                    increasing the availability and use of condoms. One element of their promotion
                    operation was a troupe of actors who put on ribald comedy skits to put their
                    AIDS prevention message across. For this they managed to hire a dwarf who had a
                    national following as a comedian as well as a tallish, rather plump woman who
                    played his wife in domestic skits centering on his puffed up male vanity and his
                    constant philandering. Their skits were side-splittingly funny.</p>
                <p>After the comedy part the young American woman who was PSI's publicity manager
                    give a demonstration on the proper application of a condom using a bananwhich
                    was a little funny, but definitely got the message across. This was followed by
                    a question and answer session. The time I was there as guest of honor, one
                    fairly wispy little man in the audience said that he agreed on the importance of
                    safe sex, but was worried about the size of the condoms. Weren't there larger
                    ones than the one she used in the demonstration? The reactions among the other
                    men in the audience ranged from eye rolling to expressions of shared concern.
                    This prompted the presenter, maintaining a perfectly straight face, to
                    demonstrate how stretchy condoms are. Afterwards I told the American lady that
                    the ringer in the audience was a nice touch. She said he wasn't a ringer and
                    that they got one such questioner just about every time they put on the show. I
                    should point out that these shows had a broad appeal, but the audiences were
                    usually drawn more from the skilled and semiskilled urban workforce than from
                    the middle class or the elite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It was my understanding that, following phase out of the Ivory Coast
                    bilateral program, these family planning and the HIV/AIDS activities were to be
                    subsumed under one or more REDSO-managed regional programs. I'm not sure how
                    this worked out.</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>One of the pleasures of running the health and family planning project was
                    working with the Minister of Health at that time. He was really a super guy. He
                    was, of all things, a cardiologist. And this gives you an idea of how things
                    sometimes work in that part of the world, no less - and maybe even worse - in
                    Ivory Coast than in neighboring countries. Dr. Alain Ekra was the director of
                    the national cardiology institute before he was appointed Minister of Health. He
                    had superb training and was a thoroughgoing gentleman. It was said that he wept
                    when told of his assignment as Minister of Health. He loved his work and his
                    institute, and he had no background in public health. The word was that this
                    seemingly illogical change came about because one of President
                    Houphouet-Boigny's nephews was Ekra's deputy at the institute. The President
                    wanted the nephew to be the man in charge. The President was understood to have
                    a serious heart condition. He apparently must have supposed that it was more
                    important to be in the care of a relative than in the care of the better
                    qualified and more senior man. So if that was his premise, his action was quite
                    logical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Anyway Dr. Ekra really was a dream to work with. Early in our working
                    relationship we presented him with a preliminary description of the activities
                    that we thought made sense in the fields of Family Planning and HIV/AIDS
                    control. He said that our thinking was on target, but it would be impossible to
                    accomplish our aims by working within the government health sector. However, he
                    was willing to sign a master project agreement that obligated funds for a
                    broadly described set of purposes to be achieved through grants to the two
                    Ivorian NGOs that both parties agreed were appropriate for the purposes. Based
                    on my previous experience, this pragmatic and courageous act placed him in a
                    class by himself among Ministers of Health. His willingness to do this may have
                    been in large part a function of his not being part of the public health
                    fraternity. To them, he had to be a traitor to his constituency.</p>
                <p>We also had a regional secondary city urban development project with an Ivory
                    Coast component. As I recall, bilateral funds were used to buy into the regional
                    project to support the Ivory Coast component. Abidjan had for many years hosted
                    an AID Regional Housing and Urban Development Office (RHUDO). Reduced in size,
                    it was absorbed into REDSO about halfway through my three years in REDSO. There
                    was a lot of bilateral donor coordination in the municipal and decentralized
                    development field in Ivory Coast. The responsible RHUDO/REDSO staff were
                    excellent technicians and played a leading role in developing the ideas that
                    other donors and AID collaborated in supporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there a major AID housing project in the Abidjan
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. There were several that had been completed by that time. We took
                    people to see them, but they were no longer active as AID projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had worked out well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. But they were big, full-blown sites and services and/or low cost
                    housing guaranty projects.</p>
                <p>The efforts during my time were focused on secondary cities or towns. An
                    important contextual factor was the push in Ivory Coast and some other countries
                    in the region to decentralize development responsibility and devolve increased
                    financial authorities on rural districts and incorporated towns. Unfortunately,
                    this was not done for the best of reasononly the most necessary. The national
                    governments' recognition of the benefits of this approach coincided with their
                    recognition that they could no longer finance the operating costs of these
                    entities from the center. So one of the major thrusts of the project was
                    training municipal staff in the new thinking and the new skills that were
                    required of them. It also provided technical assistance in tax base development.
                    This largely involved cadastral surveys to classify land holdings and determine
                    ownership. Another thrust involved exploring prospects for privatization of
                    municipal services and supporting limited experiments along that line. I don't
                    recall that we had time to proceed very far with that aspect, however. Here
                    again, when phase-out was in clear prospect, we sought to continue the Ivory
                    Coast activity under a continuing regional project that would extend some of its
                    thrusts to the other countries in the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this throughout the region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, the Ivory Coast bilateral element of the program had funding for
                    actual implementation. I believe the region-wide element was basically for
                    training and for very little, if any, technical assistance for
                    implementation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the relations with the African Development
                        Bank? Did you have a project with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we supposed to do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>GILBERT: It was a very complicated project. But we were mainly providing funds
                    for them to use for technical assistance in the development of sector programs
                    and projects. Wayne King was the project manager until he left to become AID
                    Affairs Officer in Kinshasa. I'm pretty sure that the AFDB did the contracting
                    for most of the technical assistance with our concurrence and was reimbursed
                    afterward with project funds. Decisions about technical services to be provided
                    under the project were governed by rigorous criteria and procedures that the
                    AFDB - or, occasionally, someone on our side - had to observe whenever they
                    proposed to use the project's resources. The idea was to discipline the process
                    and discourage individuals on either side from thinking of the project as a
                    slush fund.</p>
                <p>The African Development Bank is a serious institution in the sense that it is
                    full of a lot of capable people, including some who are quite impressive.
                    However, because the people and the units aren't very good at cooperating with
                    one another, it doesn't really perform at anywhere near its potential
                    capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is quite thoroughly Africanized, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. There were only a very few non-African (called “non-regional”)
                    staff, and they were in highly specialized functions.</p>
                <p>Most of the staff are highly qualified and, as far as I was able to observe,
                    quite effective at both the working and policy levels. However, the management
                    culture leaves a good deal to be desired. In general, there is too little
                    horizontal integration or coordination. But the really bad news is that the
                    larger management units are vertically integrated in the extreme. I have heard
                    more than one person associated with the AFDB say that it functions like a big
                    African village wherein there is almost no delegation of authority and the
                    smallest matters are referred to the chief, in council, for a decision. People
                    may come together to discuss common problems and reach a consensus but the chief
                    is involved in surprisingly routine matters that could be safely left to the
                    discretion people well down in the organization.</p>
                <p>Another reason for all the “drill” associated with implementation of the AFDB
                    project was to assure that procurement was competitive and transparent. Many of
                    the rules they had to follow were dictated by U.S. procurement precepts. We
                    regarded this both a safeguard and an element of the technical assistance
                    provided through the project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this cause much chafing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>GILBERT: They didn't complain too much. For some, that may have reflected their
                    recognition of its futility. But most seemed to see the value of the procedures.
                    They saw that there was very little arbitrariness in the workings of the project
                    and that all had to follow the same rules of the road. I imagine many kind of
                    liked that. Every once in a while, one of the higher ups in the Bank would seek
                    a commitment from me or my Deputy or Wayne King to move forward with something
                    of “very special” importance, and we simply answered that there was an
                    established process that we weren't free to suspend and that the idea would have
                    to be handled on its merits as judged by the “committee.” That did little to
                    enhance my standing or “coziness” with the top management of the AFDB, but I
                    have never set much store on seeking anything more than correct and mutually
                    respectful relations with host government or cooperating institution officials.
                    I've never found that approach to prevent development of genuinely warm
                    friendships with the truly good people on the other side. Most of our AFDB
                    colleagues seemed to appreciate being part of something transparent and
                    structured enough to protect them from questions of impropriety.</p>
                <p>However, the complexity of the project became a millstone around our neck when we
                    received the report of a midterm evaluation that had been carried before my
                    arrival by a Robert Nathan Associates team led by Irv Rosenthal. As I recall
                    that report found that many of the technical assistance packages delivered under
                    the project had too little or no connection with the outputs and end-of-project
                    status (EOPS) indicators that had been established in the project agreement. The
                    AFDB's response, after a very long delay, was to send a heated and very lengthy
                    rebuttal in which they took issue with every jot and tittle of the report. Wayne
                    sided with them, so we largely endorsed the Bank response and sent it back to
                    Nathan Associates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we were financing studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes, studies, technical assistance and on-site traininall carried out by
                    consultants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not long-term technical assistance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: There were a few American staff, and we didn't finance them. As I recall
                    our financing was limited to technical assistance of no more than six months'
                    duration.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>The Nathan people replied in the spirit of the AFDB rejoinder. I can't remember
                    how we settled the matter. It was a mess because Nathan Associates couldn't get
                    their final payment until their report was accepted. Recriminations went back
                    and forth for at least 18 months after the first draft of the AFDB's first
                    rejoinder was received. I'm surely confessing to a failure but no one but Wayne
                    King could get their mind around the complexities of the interchanges between
                    the Bank and Nathan Associates. I think it was only after Wayne left Abidjan
                    that we were able to settle the matter by paying Nathan Associates but not
                    distributing the finalized report. When we designed a follow-on project we made
                    sure that it focused on only two sectors: private enterprise development and
                    environmental management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, any other dimensions? What was your sense of the
                        region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Let me just speak about two other things that I did. One involved
                    Nigeria and the other Mauritania. I was placed in charge of the AID programs in
                    both countries for quite long periods because of vacancies in the top jobs. I
                    was formally named Acting AID Representative in Mauritania for probably a year
                    or so. For Nigeria I was only an Acting AID Affairs Officer. There is an
                    instructive story behind the difference in the two titles. Let me say something
                    about the Nigeria case first. It was a vivid experience. I had to go there
                    twice.</p>
                <p>Brief stints as Acting AID Affairs Officer in Nigeria and Acting AID
                    Representative in Mauritania</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: AID was running a family planning and child survival program that was, I
                    believe, supported both by bilateral and regional projects. During my time of
                    involvement the main activity was the Family Health Services project. It funded
                    at least five or six sub-activities that dealt with such needs as provision of
                    public and private sector family planning and primary health services; training
                    of health professionals in the provision of family planning services and primary
                    care; public health education; family planning advertizing and publicity;
                    commercial and public sector distribution of family planning supplies; a
                    separate program for social marketing of contraceptives, etc. A separate
                    contractor implemented each of these sub-activities, and one contractor was
                    responsible for providing common logistical and administrative support for all
                    the contractors. On top of that there was an overall coordinator of all these
                    lash-ups who was, I believe, a personal services contractor (PSC). The budget
                    for Nigeria during this time ran about $7 to 10 million.</p>
                <p>I think there were only two direct-hire professional USAID positions in Lagos.
                    One was for a Program Officer and the other was for an AID Affairs Officer.
                    There may also have been a USDH secretarial position.</p>
                <pb facs="0203" n="Page0203"/>
                <p>This was a very unusual set-up. I often wondered about the reason for having such
                    a small USDH staff to manage such a large effort. This is largely explained by a
                    bizarre tug of war between AID and State over desirable residential property on
                    Ikoyi Island. The former Mission Director's house was owned by AID. When AID had
                    phased down its USDH numbers to the point that the assignment of a senior AID
                    officer to Lagos could no longer be justified, the decision was made to allow
                    State to borrow or lease the Mission Director's residence. State promptly made
                    it the residence for the DCM. For a time, most of the USAID officers posted to
                    Lagos to oversee the remaining small program were distinctly middle level, but
                    as the program became more and more large and complex, increasingly senior AID
                    officers were assigned to Lagos as AID principle officer. This process
                    culminated in the assignment of Gene Chiavaroli to replace Hank Merrill. Gene
                    was a Minister-Counselor and yet the title remained AID Affairs Officer. I was
                    told that State insisted on this because, AID Affairs Officers are not entitled
                    to representational housing, whereas Mission Directors and AID Reps are. By
                    keeping the representational profile of USAID down, they were preventing AID
                    from justifying a request that the DCM's house be returned for the use of the
                    AID principle officer's use. I'm told that State refused to discuss the
                    situation. I made a small effort to draw the DCM (who was a good friend from
                    graduate school days) on the subject, and got nowhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is illustrative of the competitiveness between
                        agencies and control of property and rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: It also helps one to understand why the administrative management
                    professionals in the Africa Bureau and in the central management bureau of AID
                    were dead set against committing to an AID phase-out in Tanzania when it was
                    inevitable that the Tanzanians would embrace policy reform (because they had no
                    other choice) and that AID would be required to reactivate its program and
                    reacquire housing and other real estate. But the people who insisted on the
                    phase-out in Tanzania were not interested in pragmatic considerations like
                    these. For them it was a matter of acting out a political message.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I had never seen the likes of the AID operation in Lagos. There were two
                    USDH professionals who were responsible for overall management of an amazing
                    conglomeration of contractors and PVOs that were operating a far-flung and
                    complex program. These two direct-hire officers sat in the Embassy while the PSC
                    coordinator and all the Chiefs of Party/managers of the contracts for components
                    of the AID program sat in a separate building several miles away. I believe it
                    was located on Ikoyi Island while the Embassy was, by then, located on Victoria
                    Island. With the traffic in Lagos, one did not lightly undertake to drive from
                    either location to the other. It could take 20-30 minutes or, just as likely,
                    half the day.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>Hank Merrill preceded Gene in that job. He had decided that it made sense to
                    consolidate the contract and USDH managers in one building. And he was dead
                    right. It was more important for the AID officers to be close to those
                    operations than to be sitting in the Embassy next to the Ambassador and the
                    other members of the country team. The vulnerabilities of such a highly
                    leveraged program management structure were great enough without this separation
                    of the direct-hire from the contract managers. Also, the Embassy staff was
                    growing and the Administrative Officer of the Embassy had told Hank that it
                    wouldn't be long before he and the Program Officer would have to find office
                    space elsewhere.</p>
                <p>So Hank had negotiated with the landlord of the building that housed the AID
                    contractors to expand the building so that it would provide office space for him
                    and the Program Officer plus some space for other purposes. AID wouldn't finance
                    the expansion, but would sign a contract setting forth the terms on which the
                    expanded space would be leased. But then, before the agreement (which had
                    received REDSO legal clearance), was signed, Hank got sick and had to be
                    medically evacuated. After he had been gone for several weeks, or maybe even a
                    couple of months, it became clear that he could not return. Gene was selected as
                    his replacement, but couldn't be released from his duties as Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator in the scientific and technical bureau for many months. So I was
                    appointed Acting AID Affairs Officer for the interim.</p>
                <p>After a few weeks, I decided that I had better go over to Lagos to get acquainted
                    with my new responsibilities and the staff there. When I did so, I found that
                    the agreement had not been signed and the expansion project was hanging fire
                    because the PSC Coordinator was attacking the lease agreement. He claimed that
                    the terms were too expensive and, if consolidation had to occur, that less
                    expensive premises could be obtained. The contract chiefs of party largely
                    endorsed this argument. Next, the Ambassador said that there was no reason why
                    new AID Affairs Officer and the Program Officeor even additional peoplcould not
                    be accommodated in the Embassy. Meanwhile, the landlord was saying that he was
                    going to increase the rent for the existing space to the amount that would be
                    paid per unit after the expansion, and that unless we signed a new lease
                    agreement for either the same or expanded space rather quickly, he would get
                    other tenants. This was an entirely plausible threat.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>All this was extremely annoying. It was clear to me that the PSC Coordinator and
                    the contract Chiefs of Party simply preferred not to be collocated with the AID
                    principal officer. It was equally clear to me the Ambassador, who had a
                    reputation for taking a very close interest in and freely offering “guidance” on
                    day-to-day AID operations simply wanted to continue in that vein. I also knew
                    that his tour would end within a year or eighteen months and that the
                    Administrative Officer, who would not state his position on the record, would
                    have his way then if not sooner. One option would have been to simply sign the
                    lease agreement and let the PSC Coordinator, the Chiefs of Party and the
                    Ambassador lump it. But that wouldn't do because I knew that AID Administrator
                    Roskens and Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan would be
                    visiting Lagos in the near futurfollowing a visit to Abidjan, in fact. If I just
                    did what I knew was the right thing, these two visitors would get an ear full
                    about my “irresponsible and wasteful” decision. I also had little hope that
                    Roskens knew or cared much about AID management precepts or the downside of
                    having an Ambassador over-involved in running an AID program. I also knew that I
                    didn't want to use his visit to Abidjan to bend his ear about anything as
                    mundane as the Lagos office space issue. I'm sure he would have thought I was
                    nuts if I did that.</p>
                <p>So, after returning and trying for a week or so to resolve the issues from
                    Abidjan, I realized that those closest to the scene could always keep raising
                    new options and kicking up sand. So I decided to tie it up so tight it couldn't
                    wiggle. I took a team to Lagos to identify and check out the alleged options and
                    to analyze the financial as well as other implications of each. The team
                    consisted of a lawyer, a financial analyst and an engineer. We found some office
                    space that was cheaper but it had serious drawbacks that would cost significant
                    amounts to remedy. Other office space that was equal or superior was usually
                    more expensive or not verifiably available within our timeframe. We talked to
                    the Embassy Administrative Officer, and he said that the Ambassador's position
                    on the office space issue was unrealistic since it would force him to locate
                    officers serving classic embassy functions (political, economics, military,
                    labor) in offices physically apart from their colleagues. The Administrative
                    Office staff was already located in an annex. And, “no”, he would not put his
                    position in writing, because he could not contradict the Ambassador. My very
                    good friend the DCM knew what was afoot and why, but did not wish to take
                    cognizance of the inconsistency between the Ambassador's position and the
                    reality of the Embassy's space problems. Knowing the Ambassador, I
                    sympathized.</p>
                <p>So, on the last day of our three-day visit to Lagos, I went in and made a
                    presentation to the Ambassador, the DCM and, I believe, the Administrative
                    Officer. Based on the work of my colleagues, I laboriously laid out the facts
                    and their implications. Without referring to the fact that the alternative of
                    keeping the two AID direct-hire officers in the Embassy was essentially a false
                    one, I proved that the cost-effective solution was to sign the lease agreement
                    for the expanded, consolidated AID office space. The Ambassador shrugged his
                    shoulders and said “OK, but you can continue to use the Embassy space if you
                    wish.” I thanked him for his kindness and left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think he was so keen on having you in the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, because he was used to participating rather directly in the
                    administration of the AID program.</p>
                <p>I think the Embassy side of this episodespecially the walking on eggs within the
                    Embasswas mainly a matter of that particular Ambassador's personality, but it
                    also reminds me of and partly illustrates something I've noticed about the
                    difference in the administrative cultures of embassies and USAID missions.</p>
                <p>Debate and dialogue are essential to the program planning and management
                    processes in AID, and a typical AID mission's decision-making process is
                    characterized by the operation of checks and balances. As a governance structure
                    it is essentially republican in character. The principle officer has certain
                    authorities, but they must be exercised with the advice and concurrence of
                    others. These others know that it is their job to take issue with proposed
                    decisions that cannot be brought into accord with the precepts to which their
                    functional responsibilities bind them.</p>
                <p>Most embassies that I have observeand there have been quite a feoperate something
                    like royal courts with the ambassador in the role of the king or queen. As such,
                    he or she is surrounded by people whose role is to provide advice as well as
                    perform their specialized functions as political and economic reporting, etc.
                    But their advice is not binding, and, on average, it is offered with much more
                    circumspection than one would expect in an AID setting. Ambassadors are to be
                    addressed as Mr. or Madame Ambassador, and it is expected that one rises when,
                    as the President's representative, they enter a room.</p>
                <p>And it often seemed to me that in Embassy meetings there was a good deal of
                    trafficking in shared verities that, when invoked, were usually preceded by the
                    words “Of course, ...” I noticed that in reporting cables, either by conviction
                    or due to the need to maintain credibility, positive news items or favorable
                    interpretations of trends or events were almost invariably followed by a
                    pessimistic statement or prognostication. Though often born of a horror of being
                    open to a charge of “localitis” and, occasionally, of the actual convictions of
                    the reporting officer (especially among officers doing their obligatory “African
                    tour”), I believe these predictable “negatives” also reflected a need to pay
                    obeisance to a State Department culture of Afro-pessimism or, perhaps, global
                    pessimism. But that is the default setting. Sometimes it is required to uphold
                    some particular optimism. In my opinion, it is because of these strictures that
                    it there is a lot of concern in State Department circles about dissent channels
                    and awards for people who have suffered for their frankness or, in effect, for
                    “speaking truth to power.”</p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>In dealing with Embassies or State Department geographic offices, I remember
                    being told from time to time that an Ambassador “wanted” something as if that
                    were all I needed to know about the matter. I have noticed that it is not
                    particularly unusual for Ambassadors to send heated and huffy cables to complain
                    of or insist on something. There is even a term of art, “screamers,” for cables
                    of this ilk. I have the impression that an effort to placate the indignant
                    Ambassador is the usual response. In contrast, it seemed to me that on the much
                    rarer occasions when an AID principle officer was rash enough to send in a
                    “screamer” he or she was more likely than not to become the temporary object of
                    mirth and derision at best and suffer loss of credibility at worst. It was not,
                    as in the State Department, simply a useful ploy for getting something taken
                    care of.</p>
                <p>I could name Ambassadors and Embassies at particular times that seemed to me
                    blessedly exempt from the tendencies I described. I can also point to AID
                    Mission Directors whose paranoia or megalomania made their tours exercises in
                    regimentation and thought-control. Yet, by and large, I think the contrasts in
                    the styles and tendencies of the State and AID cultures as described above are
                    real. But, I digress!!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The end of 1993...not too long ago. Well, let's step back
                        now and take a broad look at the history of your experience and go down
                        several avenues. First, what do you think are some of the lessons you
                        learned from related to development programs and to assisting developing
                        countries? What would you say to someone who is going into this business
                        about what to look out for, what works and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Great! You are inviting me to launch my true second career as a geezer.
                    Okay, geez I will.</p>
                <p>For a development agency, analysis, reflection and decision-making are as
                    important as doing. Therefore, AID needs to maintain the objectivity and
                    intellectual honesty of these internal functions. This is difficult for a many
                    reasons. One hazard is that AID and other agencies need to establish program
                    priorities and themes that are consistent with the technical capacities that
                    they either have or intend to acquire. But working with programmatic themes is
                    risky. One reason is that most of us are overeager to find simple formulae.
                    Another is that people who are competing in a bureaucratic setting for funds,
                    influence and advancement, face strong temptations to be “more Catholic than the
                    Pope.” These factors generate persistent tendencies toward oversimplification,
                    over-commitment and over-zealousness. As a result, guidelines tend to become
                    shibboleths and ideas to become ideologies.</p>
                <p>An example of this process occurred when AID decided to focus programs on
                    improving the lives of the rural poor. My recollection is that the emphasis was
                    on the poor majority. But it wasn't long before we began to hear talk of the
                    “poorest of the poor”, and soon programs and projectif not whole strategieflying
                    under that banner were making their way through the approval process.</p>
                <p>Yet focusing on the poorest of the poor is nonsense because they are the people
                    you read about in the Bible who will be with us always. That's because they are
                    the minority among the poor whose problems are the most intractable. If you want
                    to start a fire you apply the match initially to the dry flammable material not
                    the sodden stuff. The sodden stuff may eventually also burn but only if the
                    larger fire is burning well.</p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>So ideas and thought about how to lift up the poor majority gave way to rhetoric
                    and slogans about the poorest of the poor in our internal discourse. I'm
                    convinced that this contributed to our going off the deep end on integrated
                    rural development. We launched many integrated rural development projects, but a
                    substantial portion of them became little more than rural social services
                    projects because, even though we lacked the improved technology to raise farm
                    output and the increased incomes needed for sustainability, we went ahead and
                    met the “needs” of the rural poor by increasing spending on health services,
                    education and adult literacy. So these “pilot projects”, rather than being
                    replicated when their value was proved, were discovered to be unsustainable and
                    mostly collapsed of their own weight. In some cases, that didn't happen. One
                    example of a sounder, if not happier, outcome was in the Mandara Mountains in
                    Cameroon where we simply abandoned our plan to do a rural development project
                    when it became apparent that we did not have a way to boost output and incomes
                    in that setting. Mali provides a truly positive example. There USAID and the
                    Government of Mali focused rural development project activities on areas where
                    the potential to increase production and productivity did exist. Through several
                    changes in mission directors, they continued these projects through several
                    phases. Through time AID and the Government have built the lessons from each
                    preceding stage into the design of the next. At the beginning the distribution
                    of inputs was in government hands, the farmers were in government-organized
                    groupings and there was little or no credit. But, based on experience, real
                    coops were developed, input distribution was taken out of government hands and
                    cooperating farmers' credit needs are now being met by private banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, getting it right in Mali took a lot of time and a lot
                        of learning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: That's absolutely right. Those two were essential ingredients together
                    with the good luck that there were areas in southern Mali with enough
                    agricultural potential to benefit from improved technology, inputs and
                    credit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else you want to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I think AID would have been less likely to go through what I
                    regard as a somewhat obscurantist phase if we hadn't purged our economists
                    during the early part of the 1970s. That was equivalent to a self-administered
                    partial frontal lobotomy. How can you operate an agency devoted to international
                    economic development without giving prominence to the discipline of development
                    economics? I think the agency's intellectual processes would have retained their
                    integrity to a greater degree with economists in appropriately designated
                    positions in AID/Washington and in larger field missions.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>Now that AID has been getting into democratization and governance I fear that it
                    may not have been paying enough attention to the discipline of political science
                    and to the interface between that discipline and development economics. I seem
                    to see a lot of activity that falls in some sense under the heading of democracy
                    and governance but does not seem linked to any conception that I can understand
                    of the critical linkages between political and juridical change and private
                    sector development. I fear that a lot of AID managers perceive that there is
                    money to be had by programming “D and G” activity and, with the connivance of
                    vested interests in Washington, they go for it even if it doesn't really
                    contribute to a broader strategy. I hope I'm mistaken, but I fear that this may
                    be another example of shibboleths and ideologies emerging from a
                    well-intentioned program emphasis.</p>
                <p>Well, another observation that I want to underline is that you can only do less
                    with less. You can't do more with less (unless people were twiddling their
                    thumbs when the effort started, and that has never been the case in AID). This
                    is probably the most important lesson that I learned from my time as Director of
                    the Sahel Office in Washington. Although I can't really see what other honorable
                    choice I had, I tried to do too much. Our staff was cut from something like 24
                    down to about 17 staff at a time when we were working very hard to prevent the
                    program from going under because of the certification requirements while
                    continuing to meet the ordinary expectations on our office. Some of the people
                    in that office “freaked out” so to speak.</p>
                <p>As a result of that experience I became more cautious and more modest in my
                    approach to workloads and challenges. This by the way is another example of the
                    danger of letting rhetoric govern in place of well-reasoned and realistic
                    analysis and decision-making. There was a lot of sloganeering during that period
                    about doing more with less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the interaction of the security-political
                        interests of the U.S. and our development interests? Were they mutually
                        supportive or were they in conflict or was it a combination of the two? What
                        was your experience? You made reference to this recently in the Ivory Coast
                        and in other places as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: In cases where our security-political interests are mild and
                    straightforward, it is relatively easy to reconcile those with AID's development
                    interests. I'm referring to cases like Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and Tanzania. In
                    those cases our security-political interests were simply that these countries
                    make economic and social progress leading to continued or increased stability
                    and that their inevitable neutrality be pro-West or at least impartial rather
                    than pro-East Bloc in nature. In such circumstances we were pretty much free to
                    choose the kinds of projects that we would support based on our perception of
                    their merits. These governments had reason to believe that our contribution was
                    dependent on our perception of their continuing seriousness and, for the most
                    part, behaved accordingly. To the extent that these programs were justified in
                    cold war terms, that had little impact on the content of our programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>But in countries where our political-security interests were strong and more
                    pointed (either to prop up a figure who was perceived as perhaps a “bastard, but
                    our bastard” or to reward political acts such as support of Camp David or to pay
                    for base rights) then it was more difficult for AID to do its development
                    “thing”, though it seems to me that AID generally tried to promote genuine
                    development in these cases as well. The only such case that I was personally
                    involved in was that of Sudan. I think the project portfolio there was quite
                    well selected and, if properly implemented, would have made significant
                    contributions to national development. The main problem in Sudan was that public
                    finances were flaccid to begin with, then upset by natural disasters and finally
                    overburdened by the war effort so that the government was broke and had great
                    difficulty doing its part in the conduct of our projects. We would have been
                    lost without the counterpart funds generated by CIPs and PL 480 Title I loans.
                    Also, I think we were grasping at straws in conceiving the thematics of some of
                    the CIPs. The quality of our contributions suffered from the political-security
                    imperative of maintaining high levels. As a result we were probably more lenient
                    than we would otherwise have been on conditionality and on Title I self-help
                    issues. But, by and large, we were moving forward on genuine development as well
                    as humanitarian agendas.</p>
                <p>The sad thing is that in most cases where the aid relationship was heavily
                    dominated by political-security considerations (e.g. Somalia, Zaire, Liberia) -
                    despite decent efforts on AID's part to promote genuine development (as well as
                    provide financial support through CIPs and PL 480 Title I) - we've seen the
                    emergence of failed states. If our support of bad regimes was an important cause
                    of these outcomes, and I am tempted to think so, I'm not sure what the mechanism
                    is that links the two phenomena. Two cases where we have had lesser, but still
                    greater than average levels of political-security interesSenegal and Kenya, as a
                    function of base rights coupled with unabashed pro-Western orientatiohave
                    certainly not become failed states, though one has to worry about the prospects
                    for Kenya. If I had to venture a theory concerning the relationship between
                    heavy U.S. support and failed state outcomes, it would be that over heavy
                    outside support over long periods allows strong men to stay in power by sheer
                    force and intimidation. This in turn probably causes political structures and
                    institutions to decay or, at least, lose all credibility. So when the big man
                    falls, the State has little authority and commands less loyalty. This can happen
                    also through prolonged, severe misrule without the implication of donors, as in
                    the case of Sierra Leone. But, without AID's involvement (and without the
                    diamond revenues in Sierra Leone), such regimes might either have fallen earlier
                    or moderated their behavior in response to public opinion before normal or,
                    let's say, peaceful political processes had so completely withered away. But,
                    tempting as that theory is, one needs to also note that Somalia and Congo would
                    have been exceptionally hard cases even without Cold War tensions, and it is
                    difficult to imagine anyone governing them according to Marquis of Queensbury
                    rules.</p>
                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>While we're talking about political-security interests and AID, I might as well
                    observe that I always chafed at the non-development justifications for U.S.
                    assistance that AID furnished to Congress and the public. I can't judge whether
                    it was necessary to use Cold War and near-term U.S. commercial interest
                    rationales, but I think we could have made a greater point than was typical of
                    asserting a long-term U.S. interest in progress and stability in the Third World
                    as essential to our grandchildren's quality of life on this small planet.</p>
                <p>The other thing that I might as well get off my chest is that the near-term
                    political and diplomatic benefits of U.S. development assistance vary quite a
                    bit depending on the type of assistance and the amount. Certainly large resource
                    transfers like those entailed in CIPs and PL 480 Title I programs can be
                    exploited for diplomatic, including political-security, purposes. But, by and
                    large, an incrementally funded portfolio of projects cannot be. It isn't
                    “maneuverable” enough to do more than contribute to a sense of cooperation,
                    mutual interest and gratitude toward the U.S. And, one has to recognize that a
                    well-administered program will occasionally generate pain and discomfort because
                    it will occasionally be necessary to deny host government wants and to insist on
                    actions that are distasteful. And, human nature being what it is, host
                    governments begin to take ongoing programs for granted. They can become part of
                    the woodwork. Given these considerations it makes no sense to integrate AID into
                    the structure of the State Department. State and AID are about sharply different
                    things. Involvement of State Department and AID officers in one another's work
                    cannot produce synergy; it can only produce the opposite through distraction of
                    each side from its real mission.</p>
                <p>When I first started out I had the impression that a considerable proportion of
                    State Department people both in Washington and in the field were inclined to
                    think that AID programs weren't worth much unless they could be milked for
                    near-term purposes. It wasn't that they tried to accomplish that, but more that
                    they saw little value to AID's presence and activities because they had little
                    direct relevance to their work. In the last 15 or so years I detect a change in
                    attitude. Most career State people I know now seem to view AID programs as
                    having a legitimate long-term development rationale, but appreciate that they
                    are best kept separate from diplomacy. I have a hard time figuring out which
                    people in State want to swallow AID. I don't think I personally know many who
                    would see any good in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were involved in two or three countries where we
                        closed down. Did political-security interests enter into these
                        situations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Definitely so in the Mauritania case. That decision was triggered at
                    least in part by the Mauritanians' having allowed Saddam Hussein to park a lot
                    of aircraft there during the Gulf war. They were being punished. The Sudan case
                    was pretty much inevitable because of a clause in AID's legislation to the
                    effect that U.S. development assistance cannot continue following a military
                    coup. But the U.S. Government, with good reason, eventually came to dislike the
                    Islamic fundamentalist coloration of the military junta. So political-security
                    interests were also served by the legal requirement for phaseout in Sudan. In
                    Tanzania, the Brooke Amendment required the phaseout. Here again, the legal
                    requirement coincided with a desire on the part of some in the Reagan
                    administration to punish Tanzania for their aggressive opposition to the U.S. on
                    certain issues, notably U.S. efforts to keep Mainland China out of the U.N. I'm
                    not sure that this motivation should be dignified with a political-security
                    label.</p>

                        involved now for 30 years or more in foreign assistance, has it made a
                        difference? Do you think AID has made a difference? Is there anything
                        special about the AID approach to development over the years that stands out
                        in your mind in terms of having advanced the effort to move
                        development?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I think it is remarkable in the context in which AID's work goes
                    forward that this agency and its people have been as sincere, disciplined and
                    thoughtful as we have been about keeping our focus on development. Even though
                    we don't really dare to tell anybody about it half of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: We have “buy U.S.” provisions in our legislation and our procedures as
                    well as a few other strictures that dilute the purity of our efforts (for
                    example, the ban on supporting oil crop production), but they didn't really have
                    much impact. The tied procurement became increasingly liberal during the latter
                    half of my career and then, despite occasional regressions, easier and easier to
                    waive. I don't think we really made explicit decisions that sacrificed
                    development values to mercantile interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't pursue mercantile interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I suppose that we may have in some cases at one time or another, but I
                    don't recall cases where we were doing projects primarily for mercantile
                    reasons. However, we were required to implement our projects in ways that
                    assured that offshore procurement was from U.S. sources unless there were good
                    reasons to do otherwise. In my experience, where U.S. procurement detracted
                    significantly from development aims, we waived the U.S. procurement requirement.
                    To me that's reasonable. Mercantilism would dictate putting trade first and
                    development second.</p>
                <p>There were certainly cases where the mixture of commercial and development
                    considerations got pretty close to even. One possible example involved the Volta
                    River Dam and Aluminum Smelter Complex in Ghana. Unfortunately, I can't remember
                    the specifics of how AID and other donor financing figured in that project. But
                    it was certainly a complex set of decisions. My impression is that much of the
                    financing came from direct investment and commercial lending as well as from
                    U.S. Export-Import Bank, AID and other donor financing. I think the smelter and
                    the bauxite exporting arrangements made possible the financing the hydroelectric
                    facility and Tema port development that the Ghanaians wanted for a variety of
                    reasons. I don't think the hydroelectric facility and Tema port development were
                    conceived so the international consortium could have their smelter at Tema. But,
                    if one wants to look for mercantilist influences on AID project decisions, one
                    might want to look carefully at projects of that type.</p>
                <p>I recall seeing efforts to nudge AID into projects that were mainly justified on
                    commercial grounds. Telecommunications is an area that comes to mind. But in my
                    experience AID simply looked into the development merits and decided not to
                    proceed. During the Reagan administration some of us feared that their
                    legitimate stress on promoting private sector development might miscarry and
                    lead to programs that were more about promoting U.S. trade and investment than
                    about development. But I was impressed and relieved that Peter McPherson and the
                    people around him allowed the professionals to develop guidelines concerning
                    private sector development, which seemed to malbeit without close inspection -
                    to be reasonable. They focused overwhelmingly on developing favorable African or
                    Third World climates for private sector development rather than on turning the
                    Third World into a happy hunting ground for U.S. corporate interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with the private enterprise
                        bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: No, I know some of the people who were involved though and think highly
                    of them. I'm not sure if Mike Farbman was in that Bureau, but I think he is very
                    sound and talented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in that Bureau. Back to this question then. Did AID
                        and foreign assistance make a difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. Most projects meet many of their objectives and many achieve most
                    of them. So, in many cases, there is a strengthened unit or institution that
                    continues after the end of an AID project. Most of the time host country people
                    gain new capabilities, as well as new qualifications, from formal training or
                    new skills from on-the-job training. New equipment and physical plant is often
                    created. Functions such as government statistics, forestry management,
                    agricultural extension services, agricultural research, agricultural credit and
                    education are improved in quality and expanded. Due to non-project assistance,
                    new policies are put in place or existing ones improved. Infrastructure is
                    created. There must be thousands of miles of AID-financed trunk, secondary,
                    feeder and farm-to-market roads in Africa alone. We have contributed to the
                    planning and construction of railroads, dams, municipal water supplies,
                    universities, teacher training facilities, secondary schools and expanded port
                    facilities.</p>
                <p>But you ask the question because the difference we hope to make goes beyond
                    leaving something at the end of each AID activity. So I have to acknowledge the
                    “Yes, but...”s. Very often host governments can't or won't cover the recurrent
                    costs of donor-funded programs and facilities after the end of the project, so
                    they wither and run down. Equipment isn't maintained and replaced when it is
                    worn out. People who are trained or learn on the job are transferred away from
                    the unit we were trying to strengthen. Policies and programs change or just run
                    down. How these steps backward compare to the steps forward made possible by
                    foreign assistance varies from country to country. It also varies through time.
                    Countries go through their good and bad times due to changes in world prices for
                    their exports, the quality of their governance, wars and natural disasters. I
                    doubt that anyone can prove that, overall, the steps forward predominate or say
                    by what margin they do so.</p>
                <p>I think they predominate, but I'm not exactly an unbiased observer. Part of my
                    reason for believing they predominate is my observation that the steps backward
                    are usually not as gross as they may appear on the surface. Buildings, vehicles
                    and other physical items may go from looking shiny and new to looking scruffy to
                    our eyes, but that doesn't mean that they aren't continuing to serve. Third
                    World standards of maintenance are inevitably lower (being under budgeted) than
                    those in Europe and the U.S. but that doesn't mean that they don't exist.
                    Sometimes the changes that occur after the end of a project should be taken as a
                    rebuke to donors and their Westernized counterparts whose pride requires that
                    physical plant, commodities and even policies and programs be more complicated,
                    sensitive and fussy than is appropriate for sustained use in the tropical third
                    world. More consideration should be given to whether buildings that need paint
                    and are smelling of mildew are still serving their purpose, whether vehicles
                    that are dented and rattle are still getting people and supplies where they need
                    to go, whether the dilution of policies and programs wasn't required in the
                    course of adaptation to local realities and of counterparts' taking ownership of
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>But even looking at things from a less culture-bound view point, sometimes
                    programs, facilities and services that were started with donor support, pretty
                    much break down when that support ends. In some cases that is appropriate as it
                    corrects unrealistic project selection or design decisions. But in most of the
                    AID projects that I know, the main costs are for technical assistance and
                    trainininputs that enhance human capacities either directly or indirectly. I
                    think the resulting increments to host countries' stocks of human capital are
                    seldom lost. Instead, this increased capacity is exploited in unforeseen ways.
                    Even if the beneficiaries are so discouraged that they leave their own country,
                    the chances are good that they will contribute in other Third World countries.
                    Q: What do you mean by that? Illustrate it.</p>
                <p>GILBERT: In the 1970s and early 1980s many young, highly educated Ghanaians left
                    their country, but most wound up in other, mainly Southern, African countries or
                    in the UN system. These folks continued to contribute significantly. Sometimes,
                    you hear of something that works abnormally well, and you find that a little
                    group of American-trained individuals is associated with it. In Tanzania it was
                    a Tanzanian agricultural research organization that had benefitted from
                    institutional development assistance under an AID project before my time.
                    Sometimes, as with a number of agriculturalists and economists in Sudanese
                    irrigation schemes, the individuals may not have been trained under any
                    particular project, but several, including AFGRAD. In Ivory Coast, when an
                    impressive civil engineering facility came to my attention, I learned on closer
                    inspection that the Government, using its own resources, had been sending
                    impressive numbers of talented young Ivorians to American universities for post
                    graduate work in technical fields for decades. The point is that when we enhance
                    human capacity in these countries, the results can accrue - and probably do in
                    most cases - whether or not we are involved either as an actor or an
                    observer.</p>
                <p>Training is the single most dependably useful thing that AID has financed over
                    the years in Africa. Think about the fact that the cost of four years of
                    postgraduate education is probably about the same as the entire cost of
                    maintaining a U.S. technician overseas for a year or, at most, two years. If he
                    or she goes back home and enjoys a normal lifespan, that investment pays off for
                    at least 30 years. I'm not saying that U.S. technicians haven't done a lot of
                    good and won't continue to be needed, but they are less needed now and, as a
                    group, I can't imagine them to have been as valuable an investment, dollar for
                    dollar, in long-term development as were the programs of training and advanced
                    education that we financed.</p>
                <p>I think it was a mistake for us to become so chary of doing infrastructure. The
                    Trans-Cameroon Railway is cost-effective and will be making a major difference
                    in Cameroon for decades to come. The same is true of paved roads if they are
                    made to good specifications. And if they are perceived as vital to the country
                    in question, they will likely receive requisite, though less than optimum,
                    maintenance. Or failing that, they will get periodic rehabilitation. And, even
                    if the donors have to participate in the maintenance or rehabilitation that
                    might be worthwhile.</p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>Creating durable change is difficult and a work of patience. AID needs to be
                    willing to abandon projects when it becomes apparent that they aren't feasible
                    or are otherwise doomed to failure. But, when a viable and valuable effort gets
                    behind schedule or needs more resources than anticipated or if the host
                    government objectively can't pony up their contributions, AID should be really
                    loath to abandon the project at the end of its planned duration rather than
                    retool and continue. Earlier we talked about how sticking with projects through
                    multiple phases in Mali paid off. It seems to me that this is one of the main
                    ingredients to making lasting contributions through donor assistance. How many
                    construction projects ever get completed on schedule or within budget even in
                    this country? Why should we be shocked and dismayed when our technical
                    assistance projects, which are so much less “mechanical”, don't work out as
                    planned?</p>
                <p>I am encouraged that many projects do get retooled and continued and that AID has
                    been giving more recognition to the need to accept risks and to learn from
                    disappointments and failures. It's important to recognize that national
                    development is an extremely disorderly process and full of surprises. Progress
                    isn't gradual or lineait comes in fits and starts. Making it self-sustainingcan
                    be like trying to produce a chemical reaction by adding all the “right stuff”
                    such as skills, knowledge, curricula, institutions, policies and physical
                    capital. But it turns out that some mystery ingredient is an essential catalyst
                    and without it the reaction doesn't take on a life of its own. When, through
                    luck, the catalyst is added, the reaction occurs. These elusive catalysts
                    probably fall under the heading of cultural change. So involvement by Americans
                    and others from the developed world in striving to promote development may be
                    best way of guarantying the unique cultural evolution that each nation needs
                    will eventually come about. I don't mean that Americanization is the goal. Many
                    successfully developing countries are culturally quite different from us. But
                    there are elements of developed country cultures that need to be absorbed by
                    Third World countries so that each evolves the unique culture that it needs to
                    make the development process sustainable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any sectors or areas where you thought AID has
                        made a distinctive contribution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Yes. I think the sectors in which we made distinctive contributions are
                    those that we saturated with U.S. technical assistance, training and,
                    occasionally, capital improvements. Those that come to mind are: agriculture
                    extension, agriculture planning and statistics, agricultural research, public
                    health, population and family planning, primary and vocational education and
                    post secondary-level education. In these areas there were many projects that
                    produced the institutional, methodological and human capital changes (let's call
                    them “widgets”) that were sought. But even where the expected institutional
                    “widget” didn't materialize or disappeared after AID financing stopped, I am
                    confident that there are individuals, groups of individuals and entities that
                    have different capabilities, different ways of looking at things and different
                    approaches to getting things done because of their involvement with the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>These intangibles are as important as the tangible things like technical
                    knowledge and skills. It is easy to forget how unique we are. You know, in a
                    number of places where I've worked over the years - like Tanzania where there
                    was a high rate of inflation or Ivory Coast because Abidjan issuch an expensive
                    city - there were times when the real, as opposed to nominal, income of AID
                    national staff declined or was unreasonable to start with. We would work to get
                    their compensation schedules rectified. We did this because it was the right
                    thing, but also because we didn't want to lose the staff. We were worried that
                    our good people would go elsewhere for more competitive salaries. But I have to
                    say that I can't recall a single case of a national staff member leaving AID for
                    more money. I think the reason for this is that they become “addicted” to being
                    in an American work setting. Why? They like having the tools to do their jobs.
                    They like being around people who are intensely goal-oriented and who don't let
                    a lot of secondary considerations (ethnicity, color, religion, prerogatives of
                    status, interpersonal likes and dislikes) interfere very much with the getting
                    the job done. Once they get used to it, they like our informality, the
                    give-and-take-relationship between bosses and subordinates, the transparency of
                    our personnel practices and the openness of our management systems (to inputs
                    from subordinates to superiors).</p>
                <p>Of course any American who reads the above would be tempted to say, “Right! Since
                    when are we so wonderful?!” Well, we're not so wonderful that we don't have to
                    keep working on all these things, but we're way beyond Third World norms in
                    these areas. There are significant differences on average between our culture
                    and those of most Europeans as well.</p>
                <p>I am just cavalier enough to attempt to sum up the difference. A guiding
                    principle in American work culture is to expect fairness and to “take measures”
                    when it is found to be deficient, as it not-infrequently is. In the Third World
                    fairness is a hope, but a pretty utopian one; therefore, the corresponding
                    principle is patronage. You depend on others to protect you, and you protect
                    those who depend on you. Creating and tending these relationships takes a lot of
                    time and considerable sacrifice of other principles. European work culture
                    varies from country to country along a continuum between the Third World and
                    American norms. There are significant differences within regionfor instance in
                    Northern Europe people stand in lines, in much of Southern Europe only chumps
                    stand in lines. Many Europeans find Americans exasperating in their moral
                    naivety, and that boils down to our ability to believe that fairness is a
                    reasonable expectation. (And, it goes without saying, that there are pockets and
                    outbreaks of Third World work culture in the United States.)</p>
                <p>The above is to illustrate that there are important intangibles that our
                    counterparts get from working in collaboration with us. People who have
                    associated with us for significant periods of time become more egalitarian, more
                    concerned about fairness and place a higher value on objectivity in appraising
                    and solving problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>You know most Americans really don't grasp how nasty life can be and how much
                    gross and petty, subtle and flagrant evil there can be in the world. By evil I
                    mean individuals and groups victimizing others. Because we are a nation of laws
                    and given that checks and balances permeate American life, the scope for bad
                    behavior in our country is circumscribed to an extent that can only be
                    appreciated by observing what goes on in countries where things are different.
                    And this difference is a good reason to make sure that our people are involved
                    in the strivings of the Third World and that Third World people are exposed to
                    our ways of running our society through programs of cooperation. Third World
                    people can see that things they put up with can be curbed and controlled. We can
                    begin to appreciate the factors that make our own societies comparatively free
                    of the abuses that are rampant in the Third World. We can also appreciate human
                    goodness better when we see it manifested in the many luminous personalities who
                    somehow manage to emerge from that wilder and darker moral landscape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about AID the agency. Did you find it a good agency
                        to work with? Did you have problems with it? What do you think about
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I haven't enjoyed every minute that I've worked in AID. I hate to
                    start with a negative, but maybe it's best to get it off my chest. I found it
                    very hard to stick working in Washington. Except for my initial years as a
                    Junior Management Intern (when my perspective on AID work was embryonic), I
                    never served in Washington without experiencing something akin to swimming under
                    water. I never stayed in Washington longer than the three-year model for
                    rotation tours. I think the reason I found it so difficult was that so much
                    energy was devoted to matters that were only indirectly related to what AID
                    needed to be doing in the field. I had the feeling that too many people were
                    spending too much time trying to burnish their own images and promote their own
                    agendas at the expense of serving AID's mandate. I disliked Washington's
                    tendency to work to rules that served individuals and groups (working the
                    minimum number of hours per day, making a fetish of EEO) but not the Agency's
                    mandate. I hated the fact that it was so hard to get people to abide by the
                    rules - such as those related to the project review and approval process - that
                    served the mandate. When I was in the field I probably harbored even more
                    negative feelings toward AID Washington than were average or normal among field
                    staff. Why? I think it was because I had an acute sense that field units were
                    accountable but that AID/W, as a whole, wasn't. A good, strong desk officer
                    could do a lot to shield a field mission from the consequences of AID/W's
                    disorderliness. But there was only so much a good desk officer could do and they
                    weren't all that common.Just in case this makes me sound like an anti-government
                    extremist, let me say that I usually vote for democrats.</p>
                <p>Overall, I have an abiding sense of gratitude that AID exists and for my good
                    luck in getting a job there. Without AID, I can't imagine how I could have spent
                    30 years of active professional life so satisfyingly.</p>
                <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                <p>One reason for this is that the U.S. foreign assistance program is the only broad
                    expression of U.S. foreign policy that I am fully in sympathy with. I don't
                    think I could have lasted long in the State Department Foreign Service because I
                    can't abide it when I think our policy is hypocritical, dishonest, unduly
                    Machiavellian or otherwise distastefuas it inevitably is from time to time. The
                    CIA would have been out of the question. USIA and Peace Corps offered too little
                    prospect for meaningful impact. The World Bank certainly had the right focus,
                    but it had no operational field staff and, owing to the “Anglo-Saxon
                    predominance”, it was almost impossible for Americans to get hired there when it
                    mattered to me.</p>
                <p>But AID offered the opportunity to collaborate with Third World counterparts in
                    fascinating undertakings. Since it operated on a significant scale and with
                    resources to match, there was a reasonable chance of satisfactory impact. Its
                    workings were transparent and governed by laws and regulations that were in the
                    public domain. It offered reasonable pay plus the opportunity to live in exotic
                    lands and become acquainted with those lands' inhabitants and their cultures.
                    What more could one ask?</p>
                <p>Well, it turned out that there was more that one could ask, but probably not
                    without abolishing the U.S. political process and human nature. I would have
                    preferred that AID be more willing to assert a long-term U.S. interest in Third
                    World development in making its budget requests to Congress and that Congress
                    accept and support Third World development as being AID's fundamental mandate.
                    Then it would have been nice if AID had been less vulnerable to fads and less
                    fickle in pursuing and abandoning them. One could also wish that each
                    administration had only appointed to the upper echelons of AID people who
                    believed in the importance of Third World development and only wished to make it
                    more productive (as opposed, say, to more responsive to extraneous agendas).
                    And, finally, it would have been great if AID had enough resources to be able to
                    maintain technical capacities in all development sectors so that we could have
                    had a better stocked tool chest for application to each recipient country's
                    specific needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the pluses and minuses, how did you find working for
                        AID.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>GILBERT: I guess I should give my views on some of the strengths and weaknesses
                    of AID that had little or nothing to do with the political force field in which
                    the Agency found itself. Let me start with a plus, the IDI program made AID a
                    better development organization than it had been. When it was first introduced,
                    I was skeptical because I thought the selection criteria, given the lack of a
                    written test (you're talking to someone who tests well), were too lax. But that
                    proved not to be the case, and the requirement that all applicants have had a
                    Peace Corps or similar experience made a great difference in the character of
                    USAID field staffs as the numbers of IDI alumni/ae grew. It made a great
                    difference to get people into AID who knew what the Third World was about and
                    who had made a conscious decision that they wanted actually to work there. And
                    this change affected all the professional cones, including administrative
                    management and financial management. When I first went to the field, there were
                    too many people in our field missions who actively disliked living in the Third
                    World and were doing so for the wrong reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it an agency that gave adequate room for
                        innovation and creativity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: To some extent, it gave too much room. While the necessity of conceiving
                    and planning strategies, programs and projects was recognized, the same was not
                    true of implementing theincluding seeing them through once started. AID top
                    management gave lip service to the importance of implementation, but never
                    figured out how to give it practical emphasis. One fundamental reason for this,
                    in my opinion, was that the promotion precepts emphasized innovation and
                    leadership in bringing change about. It seemed to me that at any given time,
                    there were usually too many people espousing innovations and questioning the
                    status quo and too few doing the best we could with what we had. I believe this
                    hurt implementation. Perhaps it was just a function of my own unique career
                    path, but I was plagued much of the time by a feeling that “forces” often
                    marching under the innovation banner - were busy unraveling what I had been
                    charged with trying to knit or hold together. Nevertheless, AID was
                    exceptionally good at implementation compared to other donor agencies, but only
                    because we had a field presence in each recipient country, and they mostly
                    didn't.</p>
                <p>The drive to innovate could produce some pretty ludicrous “fruit”. I suppose it
                    was someone in GSA who got promoted for changing the U.S. Government Memorandum
                    form so that it no longer said in descending order “To”, “From”, “Subject” and,
                    instead, said “Reply to the Attention of”, “To”, “Subject” in descending order.
                    I defy anyone to identify the practical advantage gained from that change. In
                    AID, the whole Congressional Presentation process was overhauled so that project
                    narratives were only included on new or substantially changed projects. However,
                    every time we turned around after that we had to prepare project narratives for
                    various de-cycled notification requirements. Thereafter, the CPs no longer
                    provided a record of the status of projects at annual intervals. And, it was my
                    experience that these had been very helpful for use in briefings and for
                    reference.</p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>To be candid, I have to acknowledge that I have always been constitutionally
                    distrustful of change and of the motives of those who espouse it. I guess I was
                    prematurely curmudgeonly. And sometimes I was wrong in this. I thought it was a
                    boondoggle to abandon the AID Manual Orders and create the Handbook series, but
                    I have to acknowledge that the Handbooks were much better. If they had done
                    nothing more than serve as a vehicle for the project development guidelines
                    contained in Handbook 3, they would have been worthwhile.</p>
                <p>I hardly need to say, then, that I thought the sweeping changes that began in the
                    late 1980s that undercut the role of Project Development Officers (as well as
                    necessary checks and balances) by transferring them to geographic offices and
                    led later to the abandonment of Handbook 3 in favor of a whole new system based
                    on Strategic Objective Team- and Intermediate Result Team-planned and
                    implemented activities (one no longer says “project”), etc. have produced little
                    concrete good to balance all the confusion that they unleashed. On the other
                    hand, if anyone asks me what should now be done, I'll say, “Don't abandon it,
                    for Heaven's sake, but do make whatever changes are really needed to make it
                    work!”</p>
                <p>Most of my problems with hyper-innovativeness have to do with its manifestations
                    in the areas of program and administrative management.</p>
                <p>However, I believe that rethinking and judicious innovation focused on program
                    substance are essential to the accomplishment of AID's mandate. I think that AID
                    has stood out among Federal agencies for being so full of people with ideas.
                    And, from my somewhat remote perspective, AID's top management has often
                    deserved high marks for allowing the agency to be a bustling and competitive
                    market place for those ideas. As a result, life in AID, viewed from one
                    perspective, has been a long intellectual conversation focusing, inter alia, on
                    each program strategy and project proposal. That added a lot to our success and
                    to the fulfillment of AID's programs. Even when it was decided to focus on only
                    a handful of broad program sectors, there was always funding for analysis, if
                    not actual research, aimed at finding out what was needed and what worked best
                    in these areas - so much so, that the rest of the Agency was usually jealous of
                    the responsible central bureau's budget. Many geographic bureau people were
                    really quite hostile toward what is now called the Global Bureau. But their work
                    was largely carried out through contracts and cooperative agreements that often
                    required trial field application of innovative approaches. Some Missions
                    actively resisted this and didn't cooperate. They complained that the Global
                    Bureau wouldn't address their priorities. I found that it was often quite
                    beneficial to cooperate with the Global Bureau. It was my experience that, if
                    you accepted that their minimum agenda had to be respected, they would usually
                    also meet your needs - particularly if you negotiated on that point before
                    giving travel clearance. So most of my experience with the Global Bureau
                    produced win-win outcomes. Also, I usually found that the professionals who
                    carried out Global Bureau programs were careful to keep Mission staff informed
                    of their work and share latest developments in their fields.</p>

                <p>I believe that AID made significant contributions by sponsoring new and improved
                    ways to advance economic and social development. We were aided in this by
                    productive ties to the university community and by coopting some leading
                    thinkers into AID policy jobs. I'm thinking of Hollis Chenery, Gus Ranis, John
                    Mellor and others of similar stature. Sometimes, changes that originated in the
                    AID-university nexus spread throughout the donor community starting with the
                    World Bank. I believe this was the case as regards the focus on the poor
                    majority. Elliot Berg and Carl Eicher are only two among many examples of
                    creative thinkers and intellectual leaders who contributed importantly to AID's
                    stock of ideas without actually joining its staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you were treated well as an
                        employee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Well, I certainly am not bitter. Distinguishing the Agency from some of
                    the people who passed through it, I think, on the whole, it treated me
                    decently.</p>
                <p>I shudder sometimes to think back to my days in Tanzania and am reminded that my
                    career was in a pretty parlous state then. While in Tanzania I worried that no
                    matter how well I accomplished my responsibilities there, their nature was so
                    out of the ordinary and marginal to AID's normal business that I might not be a
                    viable competitor for conventional assignments at the Deputy Director, let alone
                    the Mission Director, level. On the other hand, I knew that I had better give
                    the Tanzania assignment my best shot or my worry would definitely come true.</p>
                <p>Inthis connection, I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to Larry Saiers and Ray Love.
                    I received reassuring indications from time to time that they were paying
                    attention to the Tanzania program and my efforts there to do the necessary.
                    After Ray became Counselor of the Agency, Larry stayed in touch and gave me
                    encouragement. Also, Ann Dotherow in the Services Bureau and Carol McGraw, the
                    Africa Bureau Management Office Director, were both extremely supportive. Both
                    of them were always ready to provide sound advice not only on needed outcomes
                    but also on how to achieve them. Both of them rank among the wisest people I
                    ever worked with in AID.</p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>When it came time to consider next steps after Tanzania and I was asked to go to
                    Sudan as John Koehring's Deputy Director, I swallowed my misgivings and said,
                    “yes” because I think highly of John and because going there seemed to represent
                    the kind of challenge I needed at the time. It was a good decision, though not
                    always an easy one to live with. There again, the career risks were significant.
                    It's not easy to look good with alligators hanging from all parts of your
                    anatomy. Walter Bollinger came to the Bureau and served as Acting Assistant
                    Administrator during the last half of my time in Sudan after John left and I
                    became Mission Director. I will be everlastingly grateful to Walter for the
                    trouble he took to actually understand what we were up against in Sudan and what
                    we were doing about it. He took a positive interest in my work and became a
                    supporter. This was important because I had remained something of a
                    controversial character due to my conflict with the Assistant Administrator for
                    Africa during my stint as Director of the Sahel Office and, subsequently,
                    with.his friend, the ambassador who replaced David Miller in Tanzania.</p>
                <p>All in all, my career exceeded my fondest hopes in the opportunities for learning
                    and professional satisfaction that it brought. I think I rose about to the level
                    that my aptitudes and abilities equipped me for. I wasn't particularly cut out
                    for working at what would have been the next step in my careean assignment at
                    the Deputy Assistant Administrator level. I owe my rapid early advancement to
                    being a person who could independently see what was needed and who was
                    self-motivated to do the necessary. I always had an agenda and my bosses usually
                    endorsed my agendas with few changeat least, as long as my bosses were fellow
                    technocrats. That probably means that I am pretty good at technocratic
                    problem-solving and at organizing and supervising courses of action that embody
                    such solutions. But I have little tolerance for diluting what I see as
                    straightforward responses to objective needs with the kinds of other
                    considerations that increasingly intrude the closer one works with the
                    politically appointed echelon. I have been called “rigid”. I accept that if it
                    recognizes that I will do what I am clearly instructed to do if it isn't illegal
                    or immoral even though I have recommended against it. But I'm not able to be a
                    self-started, much less to feign enthusiasm in pursuing goals or courses of
                    action that I can't buy into. Also, I have a lower than average discomfort
                    threshold when it comes to public occasions. I've learned how to do the
                    necessary under such circumstances with a modicum of dignity, but not with
                    notable grace. So for all these reasons I think that I rose to about the right
                    level for me.</p>
                <p>Assignments aside, I was very fortunate in that I converted from Civil Service to
                    Foreign Service at the old FS 4 (GS 13) level when I was twenty-seven. I had
                    reached the old FS 3 (new FS 1) level by the time I was 31. I was promoted to
                    old FS 2 at 40 or 41. I think it was because I had been at the old FS 2 level
                    for a while before my conversion to the new Counselor rank, that I wound up at
                    the FE 4 level, which except for my case and those of some others, was the first
                    pay step of the Minister-Counselor rank. That, plus my time earning danger pay
                    in Sudan and the fact that most of my assignments were in the field, probably
                    gave me one of the most generous 30-year career earning records in AID history.
                    I am grateful for having been handsomely rewarded by AID standards for my
                    efforts over the years.</p>
                <pb facs="0225" n="Page0225"/>
                <p>It goes without saying, however, that I would have welcomed promotion to
                    Minister-Counselor rank. But the published promotion standards didn't give much
                    ground for hope. As I recall them, they included organizational management skill
                    and achievements, but emphasized leadership expressed in personally framing and
                    gaining acceptance of new ideas and new policies. Personal success in bringing
                    about reforms through policy dialogue with host government officials was another
                    emphasis. Given that I never thought it appropriate to thrust myself forward as
                    the bearer of ideas that, in well-staffed Missions such as those in Sudan and
                    Abidjan, were generally developed by others and since oral presentations were
                    never my long suit and could usually be made more persuasively by those who in
                    fact were most familiar with the material, I saw that the jobs got done, but did
                    not personally carry the ball, except when that was clearly the most efficient
                    way to proceed. Thus, I hoped for, but never very seriously expected, promotion
                    beyond the grade I held for the last 13 or so years of my career.I am certainly
                    not an unbiased commentator, but I am not sure that the emphases embodied in
                    these promotion precepts were entirely appropriate to the needs of the Agency. I
                    think the elements of the standards were individually valid, but that, taken
                    together, they should have laid primary emphasis on organizational management
                    and implementatiojust what one would expect me to say, right? For whatever its
                    worth, my view is that the main criterion for advancement in the senior ranks
                    should have to do with a candidate's demonstrated ability to lead and manage
                    organizations that produce the kind of outcomes that the Agency needs. Instead,
                    the criteria seemed designed to reward gifted solo performers whether or not
                    they were good at eliciting high levels of achievement from the organizations
                    they headed. It seems to me that the precepts fostered something of Great
                    Individual Performer model over a Great Organizational Achievement model. It
                    seems to me that the latter is more appropriate. To me, the former carries
                    perverse incentives for managers who might be tempted to try too hard to burnish
                    their personal images at the expense of their subordinates, on whose efforts the
                    achievements of the organization mainly depend.</p>
                <p>Trying to recall the promotion lists and my reaction to them, I believe it would
                    be fair to say that the majority of those promoted to the Minister-Counselor
                    level merited it according to the weighting of criteria that I think
                    appropriate, but too many didn't. And when I became aware of unhappy or
                    dysfunctional operating units it too often seemed to me that the root cause was
                    a principle officer who doing everything to please higher-ups while treating
                    subordinates cavalierly or worse. When I recall the promotions to Career
                    Minister, two things strike me. One is how few there were. The other is how
                    disproportionately women and minorities seemed to be among the selectees.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0226" n="Page0226"/>
                <p>GILBERT: Rather than “TIC” out, I guess I “LCEed” out. I had received a Limited
                    Career Extension while still in Khartoum, something that I think was not
                    uncommon. That prevented me from TICing out when I came to the maximum Time in
                    Class that I was permitted at the Counselor rank. That was a very decent thing
                    for AID management to do. It permitted me to serve for thirty years and to serve
                    my last tour in a very pleasant and interesting assignment. My LCE expired about
                    40 months into my assignment in Abidjan. I remember, when asked after about two
                    years in Abidjan for my thoughts about my next assignment, telling my DAA that I
                    would probably retire because I couldn't abide the thought of a Washington
                    assignment yet my wife and I felt the need to live in the U.S. where we could be
                    more available to our immediate and extended families. Yet I was shocked when my
                    LCE wasn't renewed. If I thought at all about the fact that it would expire
                    before I had spent four years in Abidjan, I guess I assumed it would be
                    automatically extended long enough for me to complete that assignment.</p>
                <p>I wasn't being singled out. That was the beginning of what can only be called a
                    purge of the AID senior ranks that lasted for years. I thought it was something
                    of an unnecessary blow to both my own dignity and that of the Agency that I
                    departed post before the scheduled end of my tour. But, apart from that one
                    factor, I was treated well. Many of the others who departed in that process
                    became quite bitter. One could sympathize on several levels. Many were in second
                    marriages and had young families facing higher education expenses. And, the
                    economy was pretty flat in the mid-1990s. Even though we had all been made aware
                    that we had only so many years at each SFS grade and that those not promoted
                    would be retired from the service at the end of that period, AID had been
                    routinely granting LCEs to members of the SFS as their TICs expired.</p>
                <p>Standing back a bit from its human side, this was an interesting phenomenon. It
                    cleared the way for increased promotions to the SFS and for younger people to
                    rise to principle officer and deputy positions in the field and in Washington.
                    But, from my imperfect vantage point, it seemed that promotions to the SFS were
                    considerably fewer than retirements during these years (199497). So what did
                    happen, I think, was that the age, experience and payroll costs of the
                    leadership in the field and in Washington declined on average. The new
                    leadership owed their improved standing to the new administration, and the new
                    administration no longer had to deal with the conservatism of the displaced
                    leadership of the career service.</p>
                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>It was a positive outcome for these two groups, but I'm not sure that it was, on
                    balance, good for the Agency. I would grant that it was useful to make room for
                    new blood in the senior management echelons of the career service, but the
                    forced retirements were too wholesale. Granted that the size of field offices
                    were being reduced to half or even a third of their former direct-hire
                    complements, too many officers were being put into positions for whose
                    responsibilities and challenges they were inadequately experienced. Most grew
                    into these roles, and, perhaps, one could say that this proves the soundness of
                    the risk the new administration decided to take. It was a poor approach even if
                    its consequences turned out to be less bad than they might have been. There is
                    also such a thing as opening the gates too wide for change. For example, I
                    personally doubt that the abuses inflicted by Brian Atwood's czar for
                    administrative and financial management would have gone on as long as they did
                    if the ranks of senior management veterans had not been thinned to such an
                    extent.</p>
                <p>I think that just about concludes the “geezing” that I have to offer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want say anything about your work since leaving
                        AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: From 1994 through 1997 I spent about one-third to half of each year
                    working as an independent consultant. I was very fortunate to be invited to join
                    a body called the Policy Consultative Group on Natural Resource Management for
                    Africa (or PCG, for short) that was supported by AID and hosted by the World
                    Resources Institute (WRI). I would say that about half of my consulting work was
                    related to that. My environmental consulting work centered mainly on policy
                    framework and institutional analysis. I led three natural resource management
                    strategy development assessments in Kenya, Ghana and Mozambique; analyzed the
                    institutional framework for environmental management in Tanzania; and drafted a
                    proposed institutional framework section for Guinea's National Environmental
                    Action. My other consulting work was also largely focused on public
                    administration, institutional issues and strategy development with reference to
                    regional cooperation on agricultural research and on the CILSS/AGRHYMET regional
                    famine early warning system. Two other tasks fit no mold. One was an assessment
                    of the linkages between the Sahel Regional Program and the Sahel bilateral
                    programs. The other was advance information gathering, issues analysis and
                    report writing in preparation for the review by the OECD's Development Assistant
                    Committee (DAC) of the United States' development cooperation policies and
                    program.</p>
                <p>From January 1998 to early July 2000 I was Director of the core staff of the
                    Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) that AID has financed since 1985. In that job
                    I took over from Jim Kelly who served during 1995-97. Our combined tenure
                    covered Phase III of that project. Since July, I have been enjoying the
                    retirement lifestyle, a combination of traveling, writing (including editing and
                    revising this text) and following various other interests.</p>
                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>Working as a consultant brought welcome change after years of resorting to
                    devious methods to find enough time away from meetings, marginal-to-unnecessary
                    interaction with colleagues, briefings, sifting and reading the contents of
                    inboxes and all the other unavoidable time sinks of life in a bureaucracy.
                    Consultants simply gather information, analyze it, frame recommendations, write
                    and present reports, collect their money and go home. I don't claim to have
                    great creative resources to share with the world, but I do have a creative and
                    analytical bent that was largely frustrated during my years as bureaucraalbeit
                    in a very interesting and useful bureaucracy. In my consulting, I declined
                    assignments that seemed not to offer a genuine challenge and opportunity for
                    growth. To my way of thinking, that meant turning down requests that dictated
                    filling in for direct-hire employees who were on leave or out sick, etc. So the
                    good aspects of consulting for me were the satisfaction of being free to focus
                    on challenging tasks, learning in that process and entertaining the hope that my
                    products would make a positive contribution.</p>
                <p>But there are significant negative aspects of the consulting life. Except for
                    one, all my consulting tasks involved challenging tasks and frighteningly tight
                    deadlines. Even with six-day workweeks I found that I had to work twelve-hour
                    days and seven days a week in order to deliver the goods. Cooler customers may
                    not experience this, but my reaction to uncertainty as to whether I can deliver
                    in the allotted time is to work at, but not beyond, the limits of my endurance.
                    That way if I fail, I'll be sure the timeframe was inadequate, and I'll salvage
                    some peace of mind. So, for “Nervous Nellys,” like me, the immersion factor is
                    another reason to choose only inherently interesting topics to work on. A
                    frustration about consulting is that one soon learns that it is by no means
                    certain that the fruits of one's labor will be put to use. We sometimes joke
                    that when one wants to temporize over or even bury a problem rather than deal
                    with it, the obvious course is to appoint a committee. I'm afraid that matters
                    sometimes get turned over to consultants for similar reasons. Also, the
                    consulting assignments that are hardest to turn down almost always come along
                    during the months when I prefer to be in Vermont during ski season or the hot
                    part of the summer. During each of the four years leading up to 1998 I just
                    barely managed to do enough skiing to avoid a financial loss on investments in
                    season ski passes. Another thing that troubled me was that, having definite
                    preferences regarding when to work and not to work, I used up too much otherwise
                    free time trying to arrange a corresponding work schedule. Given that these
                    efforts yielded little, from now on, I plan to be passive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working on the FEWS Project?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>GILBERT: It was an exhilarating experience. By the time I slid behind the
                    steering wheel, the project covered 17 famine-prone countries in Africa with a
                    staff of some 24 professionals in the field and a staff of 14 in Washington.
                    Most members of the Washington staff served both as functional specialists and
                    “country coordinators” for several countries. The functions represented were
                    agricultural economics, socio-economics, agronomy, agro-meteorology, response
                    planning, computer systems management, data base management, desktop publishing,
                    editor, office manager and staff director. Those responsible for the latter four
                    functions had no country responsibilities. Over the years, the number of African
                    professionals among the field staff had risen to 18. The field staff were
                    skilled in analyzing satellite imagery and integrating the results into analyses
                    of information from all ground sources to provide rolling assessments of the
                    near- and medium- term food security prospects for their countries and regions.
                    The project had developed extensive databases so that current data could be
                    compared to averages and previous peaks and lows.</p>
                <p>AID financed FEWS III through contracts or Participating Agency Services
                    Agreements (PASAs) with a private sector implementation contractor, the U.S.
                    Geological Survey/Eros Data Center (USGS/EDC), the National Aeronautics and
                    Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                    Administration (NOAA). The implementation contractor for FEWS III was Associates
                    in Rural Development, Inc. (ARD), and its responsibility was to provide the core
                    staff and conduct the central operations of the project. NASA and NOAA provide
                    various types of satellite sensing. NOAA, through its National Weather Service,
                    also provides ground station weather data in cooperation with the World
                    Meteorological Organization. The AID project manager (a.k.a. Cognizant Technical
                    Officer) provided coordination on “big issues”, but the core team coordinated
                    day-to-day operations among the institutional partners as well as conducting the
                    field and Washington operations.</p>
                <p>The project also maintained collaborative relations with food security monitoring
                    and reporting units within FAO, WFP, the European Union, CILSS (AGRHYMET), SADCC
                    (the food security secretariat in Harare) and the bodies responsible for famine
                    early warning or food security matters in the host countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>The field staff submitted monthly reports to Washington. Following up on monthly
                    editorial meetings to decide various coverage issues, including whether regional
                    or other supra-country matters required articles, country coordinators prepared
                    draft country articles with attendant graphics. These were intensively
                    circulated and critiqued by all country coordinators, rewritten, emailed to
                    field staff for them to critique, revised as necessary again, submitted to me
                    for substantive approval, revised as necessary, sent to the editor, revised as
                    necessary and submitted a last time to field staff and finally incorporated into
                    a mockup bulletin for my final review before publication and distribution.
                    Bulletins published at the end of each month were based on reports received
                    within the initial five workdays of the same month. In addition, FEWS staff gave
                    briefings on countries and regions threatened by food insecurity and put out
                    special alerts on developments that couldn't wait for the Bulletin. For the
                    Sahelian and Southern Africa countries we conducted and published annual
                    Vulnerability Assessments. FEWS III also published special reports on food
                    security-related problems and situations. Most often, these appeared as Bulletin
                    inserts.</p>
                <p>I don't think I've ever worked any harder in my life. Yet it was seldom
                    frustrating for the reason I touched on earlier. We all had a hell of a lot of
                    work to do. However, doing the hell out of it was not an insurmountable problem
                    because we were mostly free of the distractions (like “taking in of one
                    another's laundry” to my way of thinking) that one must put up with in a
                    bureaucratic setting. I suppose that what I used to tell my sons I did for a
                    living, “Talk on the phone and drink coffee,” was still largely true for me. But
                    it was less true than ever before, and my teammates in Washington were mostly
                    able to concentrate on their professional agendas.</p>
                <p>The caliber of the people who man the FEWS project is extremely high. Both in the
                    field and in Washington, most of the FEWS III staff had worked on preceding
                    phases of FEWS under different contractors. They knew their technical
                    specialties and food security in depth. They worked hard and smart. There were
                    plenty of hard substantive issues to grapple with. There were also operational
                    challenges. Quality management revolved entirely around making good work
                    excellent. From the perspective of my previous experience as a manager, it was a
                    peak experienclike an ordinary motorist getting to drive a high-performance
                    sports car.</p>

                        of interesting, good material.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GILBERT: Thank you for the opportunity and for your skill and patience in guiding
                    the interview.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>(Let me record also that I worked with you when you were Director of AFR/CWA for
                    a time before I went to Ghana and again when you were Mission Director in Ghana
                    beginning about six months before I went to Nigeria in 1971. The same is true
                    yet again when you were Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa during my
                    first year back in Washington in 1980-81 after I had returned from Cameroon.
                    During, between and beyond those periods I always counted you among my most
                    valued role models and mentors. I learned a great deal from your guidance and,
                    above all, from your example. I can't thank you enough.)</p>
