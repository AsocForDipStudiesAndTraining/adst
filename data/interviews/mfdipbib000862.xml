                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Ambassador, let me start as we do in all these
                        interviews with a question about your background. Where did you start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I was born in Richmond, CA in 1918. I went to primary and secondary
                    schools there and then went to the University of California at Berkeley. I
                    graduated as an English major in 1938. My father had been a part owner of a
                    daily newspaper in Richmond. I had grown up in the newspaper world and have
                    every intention of following a newspaper career. After graduation, I worked on
                    the Richmond Independent for a year and then went to the School of Journalism at
                    Columbia University, from which I was granted a Master's Degree. I also received
                    a Pulitzer travel scholarship in 1940 which was awarded annually to three
                    graduates of the school. In return for a check of $1,500, you had to promise to
                    stay out of the country for at least nine months.</p>
                <p>So I decided to go around the world in 1940-41. I bought a ticket on the
                    Osaka-Seosin-Kiasha lines for $600 and was more or less on the last Japanese
                    ship to dock at several ports around the world. I spent six weeks in Japan and
                    two weeks in North China, which was then occupied by the Japanese. I was in the
                    company of Carl Koop, who was the curator of the oriental exhibit at the New
                    York Public Library, whom I met on the ship while we were crossing the Pacific.
                    Then I visited what was then known as the Dutch East Indies, then Ceylon, then
                    India where I spent another six weeks. There I met leaders of the Congress
                    Party, including Gandhi. By that time, I had developed an association with the
                    San Francisco Chronicle, which allowed me to interview people as I traveled
                    around the world. From India, I went to South Africa and across to Argentina,
                    Chile and Brazil and then I returned home.</p>
                <p>On my travels, I met some Foreign Service people. I remember particularly Consul
                    General Gray in Colombo, Ceylon who wanted to know what I was doing in his
                    territory. I developed an interest in the world outside the US borders. When I
                    returned, I went back to work on Chronicle. Then I joined the Navy in January,
                    1942. I served primarily in the US, particularly Hawaii, in the naval
                    intelligence branch.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My father died during the war. My mother sold out our interest in the Richmond
                    Independent. She helped us to buy a weekly newspaper in Walnut Creek, CA. My
                    wife and I ran that for about 18 months. One night, at a dinner party with some
                    friends, I heard about someone who was taking something called the Foreign
                    Service Entrance Examination. That sounded interesting. So for the heck of it I
                    decided to take it. I passed both the written and the oral — the latter on May
                    17, 1947. I remember the day well because it was the day our first son was born.
                    On that day, I also learned something that was important in the Foreign Service.
                    There were three of us who took the oral exam in San Francisco. One was Hugh
                    Appling, who also joined the Foreign Service, myself and another young man,
                    whose name I have long forgotten. He sat with us while we were waiting for the
                    exam. I listened to him talk about his travels in Europe, the languages he knew,
                    etc. I said to myself that I with no training in international relations didn't
                    have a prayer of passing the exam. But I took the exam. On the board sat a man
                    by the name of Charles Eberhardt, who had been Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
                    Plenipotentiary to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. He always asked a question about
                    baseball. Since I had done some sports writing, he asked me a very intricate
                    question of how to score a fielder's choice. This is pertinent because some
                    years later I met the Chairman of the panel that interviewed me and had passed
                    me. I was already in the Service when I met the Chairman. I reminded him of the
                    time we met in San Francisco and inquired about the other candidate who appeared
                    to have so many qualifications, but apparently had not passed. The Chairman
                    acknowledged that he remembered that series of exams. He told me that Eberhardt
                    had asked a baseball question to this other young man. He had asked who Connie
                    Mack was. In 1947, Mack was still a well known name and was the manger of the
                    Philadelphia Athletics. The other candidate did not know. That started the panel
                    to ask a lot more questions about the United States. It was obvious that the
                    young man knew everything about Europe, spoke several foreign languages, but
                    knew little about his own country. I have often passed that lesson to people
                    preparing for the Foreign Service exam because too often people do not realize
                    that the Foreign Service's job is to represent the United States which includes
                    explaining about our country. I found that growing up in the highly political
                    atmosphere of small city newspaper was very helpful both before and after
                    entering the Foreign Service. I gave me a glimpse into the operations of our
                    political institutions as well as politics in general.</p>
                <p>So my wife and I decided to sell the newspaper and enter the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you entered the Foreign Service, what kind of
                        training did you receive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I attended the A-100 course which was basically, as it always has been, a
                    course in the rules and regulations of the Foreign Service. It wasn't until I
                    had left the Foreign Service, teaching at Georgetown University, that I began to
                    learn about the basic classical literature on the practice of diplomacy. In 1947
                    and even today, that is not taught at the Foreign Service Institute. Foreign
                    diplomats talked about Sato and Nicholson, but all of that was totally
                    unfamiliar to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1947, what was the your view and that of your
                        classmates about the United States' role in the world and how you looked at
                        the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I understood the circumstances better after I had been in the Service
                    than I did in 1947. Then I had a general idea of what the Foreign Service
                    represented. I had a general appreciation of the fact the United States, after
                    World War II, was assuming new responsibilities. The Service was expanding, but
                    I did not have a good comprehension of the situation until after my first tour
                    of duty in Karachi. My experience there led me to realize that those of us who
                    entered the Service in 1946-7 were a very new breed of officers. We had
                    different backgrounds, preparations, interests and perhaps even different
                    priorities from our colleagues who had joined the Service before the War. Their
                    views were very Euro-centered.</p>
                <p>I came in against a background of having had at least a brief encounter with the
                    independence aspirations of the colonial world. I had an interest in that
                    development which to many of the previous generation was either incomprehensible
                    or unacceptable or which they found uncomfortable. There were others in my class
                    who saw opportunities, certainly in South Asia and in Southeast Asia and later
                    in Africa, which our predecessors did not foresee or appreciate. There was also
                    a clash between generations as many of us who were less interested in the
                    formalities, the tradition, the niceties of protocol than in the jobs that we
                    were assigned to do. We were also a group which was more prepared to involve
                    ourselves in the internal political developments of a foreign country than had
                    been considered appropriate by the pre-War Service.</p>
                <p>I had requested that my first assignment be to India because I had been
                    fascinated by it and its independence movement during my travels. I was assigned
                    to Karachi, which had become the capital of the new independent state of
                    Pakistan (August 14, 1947) and arrived on the day Gandhi was assassinated —
                    January 30, 1948. We had a very small Embassy; there were only about six
                    Americans. The circumstances were quite difficult at the time. I was assigned
                    general duties for the first three months. When USIA's predecessor agency was
                    organized, in light of my background, I was offered the job of information
                    officer. I was essentially to start our information program in Pakistan. That
                    brought me directly face-to-face with the difficulty that the older members of
                    the Foreign Service had in understanding why the US was starting an information
                    program. They had difficulty in understanding the propriety of a young Foreign
                    Service officer, in a separate office located downtown Karachi, who visited
                    Universities, politicians, etc who did not work through the Foreign Office. This
                    was symptomatic of the change that was taking place in the conduct of
                    international relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Pakistan in the 1948-50
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: The partition of India had been accomplished hurriedly. The British, and
                    particularly Mountbatten, was not sympathetic to the creation of Pakistan. That
                    meant that the government of Pakistan, established in August, 1947 in Karachi,
                    was a government without any resources, files, equipment or any of the
                    necessities required to operate. I remember some notes that we exchanged with
                    the new government: we typed not only our note to them, but their reply to us as
                    well on our typewriters because they didn't have any in the Foreign Ministry.
                    Karachi had been a city of 350,000 people before partition; about 125,000 of
                    those were Hindus or Parsi who left for India. In return, 500 to 600 thousands
                    Muslim refugees had flowed into the city. When we arrived, Karachi was an
                    over-crowded city with people sleeping on sidewalks with all of their meager
                    possessions — little bundles that stood besides them. Some did not rise in the
                    mornings and were carted away.</p>
                <p>The remnants of the bitter communal riots between Muslims and Sikhs of the Punjab
                    were still very much in evidence. The day before we arrived witnessed that last
                    communal riot in Karachi with about 125 Sikhs being killed in the center of the
                    city. So Karachi was a city under great stress. The diplomatic corps was housed
                    mostly in one hotel. The American Embassy had been fortunate because it
                    benefitted by a deal that a Parsi had made with the government which protected
                    his house, which was next to our residence, from government seizure in return
                    for him building three houses for the diplomatic corps behind the residence. We,
                    the Newsoms, got one of those houses because we had a child and that put us on a
                    priority list. We shared that house with another family — the Josephs — for
                    three months. The house had no screens, no air conditioning which were almost
                    essential in Karachi and the house was very basic. Karachi was without a doubt a
                    hardship post by American standards, but it was a post where a small group of
                    American Foreign Service people would work well together in the face of
                    adversity. The group was led first by Charg� Charles William Lewis, then Paul
                    Alling came as the first Ambassador. He developed cancer shortly after arrival
                    and died within a few months. Hooker Doolittle, who had been Consul General in
                    Lahore, was brought to Karachi to act as Charg� until the new Ambassador
                    arrived.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Hooker was one of the great characters of the Foreign Service. His
                    grand-daughter, I believe still lives in the Washington area. He once told me
                    that he would never be an Ambassador, but that he had a lot of fun in the
                    Foreign Service being independent. He had lost his household effects four times
                    during his career; the first time was in the Russian revolution when he had been
                    Consul in Tbilisi. He had married a Russian lady and spent his honeymoon being
                    evacuated on a destroyer from Tbilisi. Then he had been Consul in Bilbao at the
                    time of the Spanish civil war. Then he was in Tunis when the Germans invaded and
                    in Lahore at the time of partition. He was a man who felt intensely about
                    individuals, sometimes with positive effects as when he gave courageous support
                    to Bourguiba when they were both in Tunis. He recognized that this was a man of
                    destiny in his country and incurred the unending enmity of the French by his
                    support. That was even noticeable in Karachi when we were there. On the other
                    hand, Hooker took a very negative view of Nehru. He wrote a piece of doggerel
                    verse called “Pandit, the Bandit” which reflected his views of the origins of
                    the Kashmir problem. Later on during my Karachi tour, Merritt Cootes came as
                    public affairs officer. He and I figured out that Doolittle must have typed this
                    poem in multiple copies on his typewriter and that he could not have typed more
                    that seven copies. In the interest of US-India relations, we tried to retrieve
                    the copies as they appeared. We thought we had them all. One day, Walter
                    Lippmann came to town and to our amazement and horror we saw Doolittle and
                    Lippmann sitting on a swinging sofa in the garden with Doolittle reading the
                    eighth and last remaining copy of his poem. Doolittle was very much a man of the
                    old school — charming, but who worked in the morning and then had two or three
                    pink gins for lunch and spent the afternoon bargaining for carpets and other
                    similar activities.</p>
                <p>Doolittle was supported was Julian Nugent, who was the DCM, Harold Joseph, Nick
                    Thacher, Tom Simons — father of our current Ambassador to Poland — and myself.
                    That was the substantive staff of the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later our relationship with Pakistan became a very
                        political one because we used it as a balance to India in a Cold War
                        context. You were there at the beginning. What was our attitude towards
                        Pakistan and India at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The attitudes of the Embassies in Karachi and New Delhi reflected the
                    views of their respective “clients”. When we got together, the conversation was
                    as argumentative as the discussions between the two countries. Tom Simons, who
                    was the INR man in Karachi, had an academic background and was a specialist in
                    South Asia. He conducted basic research. He had done similar work in Calcutta
                    and therefore had a more balanced view than the partisans. But he was the
                    exception. The rest of us thought that there was justification for partition in
                    light of the persecution that the Muslims had encountered, but we were of course
                    under the intense emotional barrage of the Muslims refugees who had fled from
                    India.</p>

                <p>The relations between Pakistan and the US in those years were difficult because
                    of the public perception in this country, primarily of Gandhi and Mohammed Ali
                    Jinnah, the founder and first President of Pakistan. I remember having to deal
                    with the American press covering Jinnah's death in September, 1948. When Gandhi
                    was assassinated, the American papers were of course filled with highly
                    laudatory comments. When Jinnah died, he was seen as austere, inflexible and a
                    man who had done great damage to India by his insistence of partition. That
                    attitude was not the official attitude, but this view was reflected in the
                    American press — The New York Times, The Herald Tribune and the other newspapers
                    that we used to receive at the time. Our personal relationship with government
                    officials were good. Washington's attitude was that given the growing tensions
                    between the Soviet Union and the United States and given the Azerbaijani events
                    occurring near by, it was in our interest to build good relations with the new
                    state of Pakistan.</p>
                <p>My reference to the Azerbaijani events concerns an effort made in 1947 to create
                    an independent republic of Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran, with Soviet support.
                    This would dismembered part of Iran. George Allen, then our ambassador in
                    Tehran, took a very firm position, supported by Washington, that the US would
                    not tolerate such action and we gave the Iranians moral support to squash that
                    drive towards independence. That was one of the first thrusts and
                    counter-thrusts of the Cold War. So Washington had those events very much in
                    mind as we developed our policy toward Pakistan.</p>
                <p>We were just at the beginning of our aid efforts. Truman's Inaugural speech,
                    which launched the Point IV program — a program of technical assistance —
                    together with our experience from the Greek-Turkish aid programs and the
                    Marshall Plan, was the beginning of our world-wide assistance efforts. Pakistan
                    was an early recipient of economic assistance and attention. While I was in
                    Karachi, negotiations with Harvard University had begun. This contract was to
                    collect a team of economists to review Pakistan's situation and to develop an
                    economic strategy. West Pakistan was a potentially rich area, but partition had
                    disrupted economic development and had changed a lot of the potential. There
                    were also problems with the economic viability and prospects of East Pakistan,
                    which is now Bangladesh. So the US was one of the first Western powers to take
                    an interest in Pakistan's economic future. I was not directly involved and don't
                    remember all the details, but Pakistan was certainly one of the early recipients
                    of US assistance in the Third World.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you developed our information program, did you get any
                        instructions from Washington or were you pretty much left to your own
                        devices?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: A lot, of course, had to be developed locally. I used whatever resources
                    were available. We used the “Wireless File” which was transcribed from a squeaky
                    short wave radio by a local employee. We began to get books and films. I started
                    a monthly magazine called “Panorama” which I believe is still being published.
                    It was about the United States. We got some money for educational grants — it
                    must have been part of a program just being developed. Our program was very
                    modest. We benefitted from the large interest in the US that the Pakistani
                    exhibited. Particularly interested was the wife of the then Prime Minister Leaki
                    Ali Khan who was subsequently assassinated. She had been educated in an American
                    girls' school in Calcutta and loved American songs and movies. We had at times
                    to temper her enthusiasm. In 1950, I went to the US as one of her escorts for a
                    trip she took to this country. One thing she always wanted to do was to go to
                    Hollywood. So we arranged for her visit to the Movie-land. We were very
                    conscious of the conservative Muslim society from which she came; we structured
                    the visit so that there would not be any embarrassing occasions. We were to
                    visit Jimmy Stewart who was then making Harvey. As we were walking down to the
                    set, some P.R. man came along and said something to the Prime Minister's wife.
                    She nodded agreement and we were suddenly whisked away to a set where Abbot and
                    Costello were making a film on the Foreign Legion. She was a long time fan of
                    the Abbot and Costello. So before I knew it, there she was in between Abbot and
                    Costello, each in a French Foreign Legion uniform having their pictures taken. I
                    could just see what a propagandist could do with that! So I immediately went to
                    the P.R. man and asked him to kill all the pictures that had been taken for the
                    benefit of maintaining good US-Pakistan relations and for the American film
                    industry. She thanked me later because she also had come to the same
                    realization, but had been so carried away by the glory of the moment that she
                    had forgotten who she was.</p>
                <p>We had a friendly atmosphere in Karachi in which to work. There was an interest
                    in the US Our facilities were very limited. We were just beginning to learn
                    about the pluses and minuses of information efforts. We learned that the
                    projection of the US was not nearly as important as how US policy was received
                    by the local population. In May 1948, when Israel was created, Pakistan, as a
                    strong Muslim country, reacted very negatively. We had demonstrations in the
                    streets in front of the Embassy. I was sent by the Ambassador to confront the
                    demonstrators and to invite the leaders up to meet with the Ambassador. That was
                    something that probably could not have been done in later years when
                    demonstrations became more hostile and virulent. But in 1948, we were able to
                    have a dialogue with the demonstrators. We had an imaginative administrative
                    officer who sensed that the demonstrators might move to the residence. So we got
                    the Pakistani police to move its kiosk from the residence to the front of the
                    house occupied by the Parsi, who lived next to the Ambassador. Those were the
                    days when things could be done more informally or imaginatively. But US support
                    for Israel as well the perception that the US was not doing enough to get India
                    out of Kashmir limited our influence in Pakistan, although I never encountered
                    the open hostility that I experienced later in Iraq.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>American policy towards anti-colonial revolutions was at that time very
                    ambivalent. So it was not easy for us to detach ourselves totally from European
                    powers and policies. We were supporting the re-entry of the Dutch into
                    Indonesia, we were supporting the re-entry of the French into Indochina. North
                    Africa had not yet become an issue, but there were some inklings of independence
                    movements there. Washington liked to stress in this period, which I always felt
                    was of dubious validity, was that we had been a colonial subject at one time and
                    therefore we could sympathize easily with those who were still under the yoke.
                    1947 and 1948 were very much different from 1776. Our revolution was essentially
                    one against members of the same race. In the post World War II period, race was
                    a significant factor and American support for Europeans was viewed through that
                    prism. There was a general recognition that Roosevelt had tried to convince
                    Churchill to give independence to India, but whatever benefits we got from that
                    were tempered by some of our actions in the immediate post War period.</p>
                <p>It is my recollection that it was a continuing effort to separate in people's
                    minds from the US from the European colonial powers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The US was a country still in its segregation period. Did
                        our treatment of the blacks get much Pakistan media attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I don't remember that as being amajor issue. We were dealing primarily
                    with questions about US support for Israel, the US identification with colonial
                    powers and the perception of a US more sympathetic to India than to Pakistan.
                    Even the USSR's policies were not a major issue at the time.</p>
                <p>Pakistan emerged as very sensitive to any comments around the world, including
                    the US, about Islam. That was of course natural in light of its roots. Pakistan
                    was the first country to try to awaken a Pan-Islamic fervor in the world. They
                    sent Chabri Kalakiusiman on a mission to other Muslim countries in 1948 to try
                    to create a Pan-Islamic movement which did not have a particularly anti-American
                    cast.</p>
                <p>How was the Pakistan press during the late 40's? Was it open or as in many other
                    parts of the country, was it “for sale” to the highest bidders?</p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I think it was a good press. We had good relationships with it. In
                    contrast to the problems I faced in Iraq later, it was a very satisfying
                    experience. Haltap Hussein, the editor of the leading newspaper in Karachi,
                    Dawn, and I became good friends. We didn't always see eye-to-eye and he would
                    occasionally write bitter editorials critical of US actions, but our
                    relationship was not affected. We would periodically be able to place some of
                    our material in Pakistani newspaper. In those years, the press had not become as
                    venal as it may have become later, certainly in other countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Like everyone at the time, we had some health problems. We had contracted
                    amoebic dysentery. We had had about every fever known to mankind. So I think the
                    Department showed some compassion and sent us to Oslo. Also at the time, and
                    rightly so, there was a feeling in the Department that younger officers should
                    get experience not only in other geographical areas, but in other functions as
                    well. So I went to Oslo as a consular officer. I spent fifteen months there
                    after which I went to Baghdad as public affairs officer. Although Oslo was a
                    delightful place to live and I found consular work interesting, you would wake
                    up every morning knowing who the Prime Minister was. That was somewhat less
                    exciting than the more uncertain parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your Ambassador was man by the name of Charles Ulrick Bay,
                        a non-career officer. What was he like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Charles Ulrick Bay was the CEO of the American Export Line. His
                    grandfather had been born in Norway. I guess he had been a contributor to
                    Democratic coffers. He wanted to be Ambassador to Norway. He was also a sailor
                    of twelve meter boats. About the only time he was seen in Norway was during the
                    summer when he spent a good deal of time at Honkers, which is a port south of
                    Oslo. He used to sail against the then Crown Prince Olaf and other of that
                    social class. He was very sensitive to the fact that he knew very little about
                    the Embassy. In January, 1951 he returned to Oslo suddenly which puzzled
                    everyone. Finally a story appeared in the New York Journal American which said
                    that when Eisenhower, then the SHAPE Commander, had completed a tour of NATO
                    countries, he had reported to Truman on the posts he had visited. He allegedly
                    had told the President that Bay was not in Oslo and had not been there for
                    sometime. Truman according to the story called Bay in Florida and told him to
                    return to Oslo quickly. So Bay reappeared. It was a little embarrassing because
                    he wanted to demonstrate that he had never been away although he didn't
                    recognize many people in the Embassy. There was an economic officer who
                    encountered the Ambassador in the hallway one day. The Ambassador asked him
                    whether he was back for another year as a Fulbright student or some other
                    entirely erroneous assumption.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>The Embassy was effectively run by Bill Snow who was the DCM. It was an
                    interesting assignment in two ways. For example, we were administering Section
                    3(c) of the Displaced Persons Act. The applicants were primarily young Poles and
                    from other Eastern European countries who had been rounded up by the Germans and
                    taken as forced labor to the mines in North Norway and Finland. Under Section
                    3(c), someone like that who could prove that he had a relative in the United
                    States, could be granted an immigration visa. This was a heart rendering
                    experience because we knew that in light of the conditions in East Europe at
                    that time the only hope they had was to get to the US So we were confronted with
                    fraudulent documents, health problems — tuberculosis primarily, and were forced
                    to turn many away.</p>
                <p>I also worked with the Norwegian police for about six months on the disappearance
                    of an American radio correspondent — Lyford Moore — who had come to Oslo in the
                    winter of 1950 on an annual tour sponsored by the US Army to observe the record
                    the cutting and shipping of Christmas trees for the US forces in Germany. He was
                    some relation to Mrs. Eisenhower. When he suddenly disappeared one winter night
                    without a trace there was a lot of high level interest. An FBI agent was sent to
                    help the Embassy. That was a fascinating glimpse of a slice of Norway life,
                    working with the police while they interviewed all possible witnesses in bars
                    and other places on the Norwegian waterfront. His body finally showed up during
                    the spring thaw. We believe that he had been tossed out of a night club on the
                    waterfront. He had come from Germany and had a few drinks and had fallen asleep
                    at the bar. A Norwegian bouncer came along and awoke him. He got up and flung
                    his arms and said, according to witnesses: “No goddam Hun is going to tell me
                    what I can do”. That didn't go over very well in Norway in 1950. So Moore must
                    have wandered down to the water and fallen in. That episode occupied a lot of my
                    time.</p>
                <p>There was another case of a man who arrived in Norway with a fraudulent passport.
                    He had to be returned in the custody of the ship's captain. I found consular
                    work very interesting and I found the experience very valuable particularly in
                    later years when I was in charge of a Mission.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: After my tour in Pakistan, USIS wanted to co-opt me. USIA was beginning
                    to develop as a separate agency, but it was still during a period when there was
                    a lot of interchange of personnel between that agency and State Department. I
                    told Personnel that I was not interested in becoming a USIA officer. But USIA
                    remained interested and when the Baghdad vacancy arose, they offered to me. It
                    was clearly an interesting opportunity and therefore I accepted it. We went on
                    direct transfer from Oslo to Baghdad in December, 1951.</p>

                    that Iraq was an artificial creation resulting from infamous Sikes-Picot
                    agreement which enabled France and Great Britain to carve up the Middle East
                    after World War I. They thought that the monarchy was an implant because the
                    Hashemite family, to which King Faisal II belonged, came out of the Hejaz in
                    Saudi Arabia. That family was not an Iraqi one. The real power rested with the
                    Crown Prince, Abdullah, who ruled with help of a strong politician, Nuri
                    Said.</p>
                <p>The Iraqis had a strong belief that the Cabinet, which was periodically
                    reshuffled, were made by either the British or American Embassies. It was
                    believed that we were still manipulating events in Iraq. There was very little
                    distinction made between the US and Great Britain. We were both the “Gray
                    Eminences” in Iraq. When I arrived in December, 1951 to be immediately
                    confronted by the strong emotions aroused by the creation of the State of
                    Israel. It was the fundamental issue that the Embassy had to deal with.</p>
                <p>Much of the population felt that not only that the regime, nominally democratic,
                    was run by outside powers and was also very corrupt. There may have been some
                    justification in the belief that the British particularly retained political
                    power by offering favors and contracts to personages close to the Royal family
                    and Said. The Shiite-Sunni split was obvious. There was a Shiite party. Just
                    before I arrived, Sullah Jabbah, a Shiite, had been the Prime Minister for a
                    relatively brief time. It was a classic situation, seen in other parts of the
                    world, of a government in power, which was friendly to us and with which we
                    believed we could work, but which ruled over a population and an elite which was
                    resentful of both the government and the perceived foreign interference. In
                    November, 1952, while I was on home leave in California, the USIS offices in
                    Baghdad were ransacked by a mob. Our offices were in a conspicuous three story
                    building in downtown Baghdad which housed our library and offices. I immediately
                    called Washington and returned to Baghdad. Apparently, on the second or third
                    Anniversary of the so-called Portsmouth Treaty — a treaty between Iraq and
                    Britain — a mob, in protest of that Treaty, demonstrated. It couldn't cross the
                    bridge to demonstrate in front of the British Embassy, so it turned on the US
                    Information Service. The building was burned out. A friend of mine, who worked
                    in the British Embassy, used to joke that we Americans would take all means to
                    distribute our material. The building had an open court yard and apparently the
                    mob piled books and papers there. The wind draft in that court yard picked up
                    much of the material and scattered it throughout the city, including the British
                    Embassy across the river.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>That was the second time that a USIS office in Baghdad had been attacked and
                    ransacked. When Armin Meyer was the Public Affairs officer in Baghdad in 1948,
                    at the time of the creation of Israel, his office had been torn apart. When we
                    talk about the terrorist attacks on US establishments, we tend to think it only
                    started in the ''70s. In fact, it has been going on for some time. At the time
                    of the second attack, Eisenhower had just been elected and John Foster Dulles
                    had just become Secretary of State. They decided that the Truman doctrine and
                    the experience of the establishment of NATO should be extended eastward. They
                    developed the concept of the Baghdad Pact. They also felt, as did Haig many
                    years later, that if we could show a resolute support for an Arab country
                    against the Soviet threat, we might be able to wean it and others away from
                    their preoccupation with the Israeli issue.</p>
                <p>Dulles came to visit Baghdad in 1953. Our USIS building was still burned out and
                    we had not been able to get compensation from the Iraqis. Indirect approaches
                    sometime produce results. I had a good friend who was a son-in-law of Said. His
                    name was Aryan Abaci. I went to him and pointed out that Secretary Dulles was
                    arriving in a few weeks. I speculated that when Dulles and the Ambassador rode
                    by the burned out building, the Secretary would undoubtedly raise the question
                    of compensation. I thought that when Dulles would hear that no compensation had
                    been paid, that he would not get a very good impression of the Iraqi government.
                    Sure enough, in a very short time, there appeared a check to cover our losses.
                    Dulles arrived and he and our Ambassador, Waldemar Gallman, launched an effort
                    to draw Iraq into a Western-oriented northern tier security arrangement. That
                    came to fruition in February, 1955, when the Prime Minister of Turkey came to
                    Baghdad, met with Said and formed an Iraq-Turkey alliance. I recall that quite
                    vividly because Hermann Eilts, then the Embassy's Chief of the Political
                    Section, and I were at a party together and were called to come to the Embassy
                    immediately. When we arrived, we were debriefed and asked to write the
                    appropriate reporting cables about this new development. That agreement was the
                    beginning of the Baghdad Pact which came into being when Iran, Pakistan and
                    Great Britain adhered to the Turkey-Iraq Pact. We never joined the Pact because
                    Dulles was concerned that if the draft were submitted for ratification, the
                    Senate might insist on a parallel security treaty with Israel, which he did not
                    feel would be in our interest.</p>
                <p>But during my tour in Baghdad, we built a security relationship with Iraq and the
                    Baghdad Pact. We signed a Mutual Security Assistance agreement with Iraq. During
                    all this time, we were pushing against the clear discomfort, if not outright
                    opposition, in Iraq to such close cooperation with Britain and the US I recall
                    going with our Charg� to the Foreign Minister's house to get the final signature
                    to the Mutual Security Assistance agreement. The Foreign Minister signed it,
                    presumably under instructions, and told us that he was going to submit his
                    resignation on the next day just to show that he had signed over his objections.
                    So we continually faced the dichotomy between the government's policy and the
                    attitude of significant segments of the population, which were not at all
                    pleased by the close ties that were developing between Iraq and the US</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You seem to suggest that the Pact idea was Washington
                        inspired. Was there discomfort in the Embassy with the concept?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes indeed. There were many signs suggesting that the concept was not
                    acceptable to the Iraqi population, but they were dismissed. It was the classic
                    illustration of the problem we have had in many places. We find a friendly
                    government which is prepared to conclude arrangements that satisfy larger US
                    interests. We then estimate whether that government is likely to remain in power
                    for the foreseeable future and is stable. If the estimate is positive, we then
                    tend to discount the contrary views. Ethiopia, Libya, etc. all opposed the Pact.
                    I remember writing something for USIA's house organ at one time on the problem
                    that an information services faces when US policies are tied to a government not
                    popular and whose perception of the United States was warped by that fact,
                    recognizing that the information service's job was to sell US policies. I have
                    seen that situation many times.</p>
                <p>I encountered another example of this dilemma in Iraq. We worked with the Iraqi
                    government and the British to conceive an economic development program, using
                    Iraq's oil revenues. From a Western point of view, this program was a model of
                    planning and interaction with a foreign government. We had a very fine American
                    member of the Development Board, Wesley Nelson. He had been one of the engineers
                    who had worked on the construction of the Hoover Dam. The focal point of the
                    development program was the recreation of the irrigation systems and water
                    control systems that had been destroyed in the 10th and 11th Centuries. Three
                    major dams were started and built in northern Iraq. But neither journalists or
                    educators in Baghdad would go to visit the sites; they showed no interest
                    because they were firmly convinced that the dams were being built by British and
                    Americans as a way to re-occupy Iraq. I went to a newspaper man one day. He had
                    just written an article about how the British and Americans had built barracks
                    for their troops in Darbandi Khan in the Kurdish area. The Kurdish situation was
                    already explosive at that time. These British and American troops would then
                    re-occupy Iraq. I told him that we were not building any barracks there, but
                    were building a dam which would benefit Iraq. I asked him to pick any day in the
                    next few months and I said that I would fly him to the area to show him what was
                    really going on. He prattled a bit and then said that he didn't really want to
                    know what was going on. He said his job as a journalist was to embarrass and
                    harass the government until it fell. He did not want to be bothered by the
                    facts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was it dealing with the Iraqi press?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Iraqi journalists were mostly “hired guns” who were being paid to
                    plant stories or to keep some stories out of the press. The press was free to
                    some extent, but it was a manipulated one. Sometime, the outcome was rather
                    curious. One day, I was in a conversation with Nuri Said right after a large
                    student demonstration. I suggested that he was being remarkably tolerant of the
                    demonstrations. He said that he didn't want to suppress them because one
                    couldn't be sure that when out of office one might not need their support. On
                    the other hand, when the Russian tanks were suppressing the uprisings in East
                    Berlin in 1953, I went to an Iraqi official in the Foreign Ministry and pointed
                    out that this was a perfect example of Communist repression. I asked whether
                    this deplorable situation might not be given greater publicity in Iraq. He
                    turned the suggestion down because he did not want to give any ideas to any part
                    of the Iraqi population which might wish to rise against the government. So the
                    Iraqi government stood on both sides of the demonstrations issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did USIS ever get involved in purchasing space for its own
                        news stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: USIS did not then nor do I think it ever has. Even then, I think CIA was
                    probably doing some of it. The Soviets certainly were. They were very active. I
                    got to know my Soviet information counterpart. He never acknowledged buying
                    space or reporters, but I think they did so primarily through providing printing
                    supplies and equipment. We gave people books. We would entertain journalists by
                    showing them films and so forth. In the Iraqi society, there was an
                    understanding that if a person was entertained, he then was under some
                    obligation to his host to view him favorably. No money ever passed. It was of
                    course for that reason that a lot of journalists would not come to our
                    functions. They didn't want to be tainted by identification with the US Embassy
                    nor did they want to feel obligated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any American correspondents assigned to
                        Baghdad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: There were no correspondents permanently stationed there. There was a
                    stringer for the AP who was also the editor of the English language newspaper.
                    His name was Anderson. There were occasional visits by newspaper people. Dorothy
                    Thompson came through once for a visit. She was part of a group that was
                    studying our policy toward Israel and the attitude of the Arab world towards
                    that policy. I don't recall any great US press attention at the time to events
                    in Iraq. The Thompson group was the beginnings of a group later called “The
                    American Friends of the Middle East” which was funded by CIA, as was divulged
                    later on. It tried to promote a better image of the US in the Arab world despite
                    our support for Israel. I remember one classic remark made by a woman, Mrs.
                    Sellers, who was one the founders of this group. One time when she came to
                    Baghdad, she was arrested for taking a picture of a bridge over the Tigris
                    River. I went to get her out of jail and as we walked away, she said to me :
                    “You know the Arabs are the most difficult people to be the friends of!”.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>While we in the Embassy may have had doubts about our policy of weaning Iraq away
                    from its preoccupation with the Arab cause, this issue was not debated very much
                    in the American media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Baghdad Embassy staffed? Were the personnel
                        primarily “Arabists”? How did the Embassy view the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I served under three ambassadors in Iraq. When I first arrived, it was
                    Edward Crocker, whose experience had been largely European. Then came Burton
                    Berry, whose experience had been in the Balkans and Turkey. He was followed by
                    Waldemar Gallman, whose experience was also largely European. He had been our
                    Ambassador to Poland and South Africa before being appointed to Iraq. Prior to
                    Crocker, we had ambassadors who were experts in the area, like George Wadsworth
                    and Loy Henderson. During my tour, the emphasis was more on the Cold War and the
                    development of a security relationship. The Deputy Chief of Mission for most of
                    my tour was Philip Ireland, who had had considerable service in the area.
                    Hermann Eilts, of course, was and still is, one of the leading experts in the
                    Arab world. There were several others who had had tours in other Arab countries.
                    We had several who spoke very good Arabic. So the staff was strong in its
                    regional knowledge, even though the ambassadors while I was there were not Arab
                    affairs experts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been told that the relationships between Ireland
                        and Gallman were not very good. Is that true?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The relationships between Gallman and all of his section chiefs were not
                    good. I personally found myself in the most difficult circumstance I have ever
                    encountered. As I have said, I was the Public Affairs officer which was regarded
                    as the Number 3 position in the Embassy. Burt Berry, a very mercurial man, was
                    the Ambassador. Ireland was on home leave, touring Europe. Berry had to go to a
                    Chief of Mission conference in Amman or Cairo. Ireland was due to return while
                    Berry was away. Berry called me in to tell me that it was not the custom in the
                    Foreign Service to change Charg�s while the Ambassador was absent from his post.
                    Therefore, he said, that even if Ireland returned, he wanted me to remain
                    Charg�. I told him that would be very difficult. He agreed, but insisted that it
                    be that way. He left me written instructions which required that I remain Charg�
                    in his absence. Approximately ten days of such an awkward situation passed with
                    Ireland remaining in his house when Mrs. Ireland, one of the old school wives,
                    called my wife to say that although I was Charg�, that did not mean that she was
                    the “First Lady” at the post. That was a very difficult period for the Newsoms.
                    Ireland knew the area. I later found out that the reason Berry had done what he
                    did is because the Embassy had begun to receive mail for Ireland from various
                    parts of Europe addressed to “The Honorable Philip Ireland, United States
                    Ambassador”. That did not sit too well with Berry.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I should add a word about the Foreign Service of the period from 1947 to the
                    early '50s. The Service went through a tremendous expansion from something like
                    750 officers to close 3000. That meant that both in the Department and the field
                    there were officers quite junior who were assigned large responsibilities. If
                    you look at the careers of some who became Chiefs of Mission and key
                    Departmental officials in the '60s and '70s, you will find that many came from
                    NEA and EA — areas that had suddenly emerged as important — where the Service
                    did not have enough experts. So young people were given assignments with great
                    responsibilities and were able to acquire great experiences very early in their
                    careers. That stood them in good stead in later years.</p>

                    new world. Many felt alienated from what was happening in the late '40s, '50s

                <p>NEWSOM: The Crockers — he was Marshall Green's father in law — were very
                    traditional. They felt that their responsibility was primarily to relate to the
                    Iraqi Royal family and much less to the broader population. I remember when King
                    George VI died. Mrs. Crocker wanted all Embassy officers to wear black ties as a
                    sign of mourning because that was what the Iraqi court was doing. I, as Public
                    Affairs officer, felt that was just what we did not want to do since we were
                    trying to disassociate ourselves from the British and the ruling family. So I
                    didn't wear one when I was working downtown. I took one along which I put on if
                    I had to go to the Embassy. That was a decision made out of the tradition of
                    relating not to the population, but to the nominal head of state. Berry was
                    broader in his perspective because he had served in the area and was a shrewd
                    political analyst. He was bitter about the Service because he felt that he been
                    badly treated by a Foreign Service Inspector, Merle Cochran. Berry retired after
                    his tour in Baghdad after delivering a bitter diatribe against the Department in
                    a despatch that he permitted me to read. Gallman was very much a professional.
                    He was there to do the job that had been assigned to him by Dulles, namely to
                    build the Baghdad Pact. I am sure that he was not unaware of what we were
                    facing. He has written a book on Nuri Said because he was in Baghdad when Said
                    and the King were killed. That book reflects more surprise at events which would
                    not have been the case had he been more understanding of the currents that were
                    flowing beneath the surface. But that brings me back to a basic dilemma faced by
                    many Foreign Service professionals. Even if he had detected the turmoil under
                    the surface, should he have stopped his efforts which he was carrying on under
                    instructions even if he recognized the risks involved? We have faced the same
                    issues in many other places.</p>

                        not in the best interest of the US as for example Loy Henderson
                        believed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Having dealt with the Arab world for several years by this time, I was
                    very conscious of the very difficult problem of avoiding parochialism on this
                    issue, just as it was difficult in Pakistan to avoid parochialism on the Kashmir
                    issue. Some in the Embassy became very emotional in their view that the US was
                    on the wrong side of the Arab-Israeli issue. The credibility of the Foreign
                    Service and of the Arab specialists particularly has suffered because so many of
                    them became emotionally involved in the issue. I felt then, and even more
                    strongly later when I served in the Department, that the US policy had developed
                    from a variety of domestic circumstances and therefore as a representative of
                    the US, I had to understand it and to extent possible try to explain it, if not
                    defend it. That is what diplomacy is about.</p>
                <p>It was a highly emotional issue in Baghdad in those days and remains so even
                    today particularly for those who served in the region for extended periods. I
                    don't think our basic national orientation on the issue is going to change very
                    much, although Mr. Baker has shown greater guts on the issue than most of his
                    predecessors.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I thought the best tactic was to avoid a discussion of the issue because there
                    was absolutely no support for the US position. You could expect to be drawn into
                    contentious discussions often and I felt it was wrong to apologize for US policy
                    or to walk away from it; I tried to explain that the policy grew not only out of
                    domestic political pressures from the Jewish community, which was the
                    conventional Arab point of view, but that there was considerably sympathy for
                    the Jews round the world as a consequence of the Holocaust. In addition, there
                    was a lot of non-Jewish support for the democratic state of Israel as
                    fulfillment of Biblical prophecies — in the Bible belt in the middle west, for
                    example. Sometimes, you could explain those rationales to people, but it was
                    still best to avoid discussions of the issue entirely. One day, a prominent
                    American journalist came to Iraq and called on the Foreign Minister, Fahd
                    Jamali. Jamali had defended the Arab cause in the U.N. for many years and was
                    very adamant about it. I briefed the journalist on that and warned him that the
                    Minister would regale him for the first forty-five minutes about the perfidy of
                    the US in its support of Israel. I suggested he should be prepared for that. The
                    journalist nodded. Sure enough, after a few minutes of the usual pleasantries,
                    Jamali started in with his speech about Palestine belonging to the Arabs. The
                    American put up his hands and said: “I didn't come here to talk about history. I
                    came here to talk about Iraq today. Let start with that!”. That really set
                    Jamali back. Unfortunately, a diplomat could not have been that blunt!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it dealing with Iraqi officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: They were friendly, but they had their sensitivities. One of the areas
                    which presented interesting challenges was the educational exchange program. The
                    Fulbright program started while I was serving in Iraq. That program required
                    that a binational committee be established which would review the applications
                    for overseas scholarships. But the Minister of Education at the time, Kuhil
                    Kennah, felt that scholarships to study abroad were a form of political
                    patronage. Therefore, he did not want a commission to block him if he wanted to
                    give a scholarship to one of his nephews or to one of the Prime Minister's
                    relatives. So we had a constant discussion on that matter. Dealing with Iraqi
                    officials at that time was particularly difficult except for the Foreign
                    Ministry or perhaps the Prime Minister's office. there were always people
                    sitting around in a Minister's office — not outside, but in the office itself.
                    They sat there drinking coffee and chatting. If you called on a Minister, the
                    conversation was very public with a number of people listening in. Private
                    conversations with Ministers in their offices were rare and hard to achieve.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>It was a very social post. You met Ministers and other officials at frequent
                    parties. You could reach out; it was not always easy, but I tried it. I met with
                    people who belonged to the opposition or who at least were not part of the
                    government, such as University professors. I used to listen to them which was
                    perhaps one reason why I had a somewhat different perspective on the Iraqi
                    attitude towards our policy. I heard people who were not part of the formal
                    power structure. I felt that from a professional point of view the position o
                    Public affairs officer in Baghdad was perhaps the most valuable one that I ever
                    occupied because I had a degree of independence and I had management
                    responsibilities — personnel and budget — which was a rare opportunity for a
                    Foreign Service officer at that level. I had a staff of 7 Americans and forty
                    locals which was a large office particularly for the Foreign Service at the
                    time. So it was good experience. I also had the opportunity to travel in the
                    country and to meet people who did not necessarily reflect the official position
                    of the government in Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Baghdad in 1952 when Mossadegh was overthrown
                        in Iran by a CIA operation. How was that received in Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: We were involved in that event, although I was not fully aware of it at
                    the time. I met a number of the people that were involved in the Iranian events.
                    They passed through Baghdad. I had known Archie Roosevelt because we had been
                    reporters together in 1940 on the San Francisco Chronicle. He and his cousin Kim
                    worked together for the CIA. So I saw Archie frequently as he traveled to and
                    from Tehran. Of course, I didn't know until later the degree of our involvement
                    in the Iranian events. One day, probably in late 52, Ambassador Berry called me
                    to tell me that I should know that the Shah of Iran was in Baghdad. He had just
                    flown in from Tehran, piloting his own plane, on his way into exile in Rome. He
                    had been overthrown in Tehran. Berry learned about the Shah's presence from the
                    shoe-shine man in the Eliah Club, which was the Club in Iran at the time. When
                    he had returned to the Embassy, he received a call from the Foreign Ministry
                    telling him that something very secret had happened and asked him to come to the
                    Foreign Ministry to be briefed. So Berry learned about the Shah for a second
                    time.</p>
                <p>The Shah stayed a days or so in Baghdad and then went on to Rome. A few weeks
                    later, the counter-revolution took place in Tehran and the Shah came through
                    Baghdad once again. We had a very flamboyant Iranian Ambassador in Baghdad at
                    the time who had sided with Mossadegh after the Shah's overthrow. When the Shah
                    got off the plane which the Shah had piloted from Rome, a Foreign Ministry
                    official told that the Iranian Ambassador was at the airport. The Shah was
                    reported to have responded that he had no Ambassador in Baghdad and walked off
                    without further adieu.</p>
                <p>I don't think that there was a very strong Iraqi reaction to events in Iran.
                    There may have been some concern, but I don't remember that as a factor. This
                    was a time when the Embassy's mood was that the US could take action when its
                    vital interests were at stake. We were a big power and I don't recall any of us
                    having any doubts about the wisdom of our Iranian policy.</p>

                        a successful coup in 1958? Did we have sufficient contact with them to know
                        their views?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Military Attach�s and some of the Political Section had close
                    contacts with the senior Iraqi officers, particularly a General Gazi Gaghastani.
                    But I never had the feeling that we had very good contacts with or a real
                    appreciation for the attitudes of the younger officers. My experience in
                    countries such as Iraq is that the military is the most difficult part of
                    society to get to know and particularly the colonels and lieutenant colonels. I
                    tried while in Baghdad to get USIS activities unto military bases. They would
                    borrow our films, but they would insist on showing them themselves. We might
                    have provided a local technician, but the military were not very receptive to
                    our approaches.</p>
                <p>The Military Assistance programs and the Baghdad Pact opened some relationships
                    with the Iraqi military, but we were inhibited to some extent by the jealousy of
                    the British who maintained a base in Iraq and who were the principal suppliers
                    and as well as trainers of the Iraqi military. Our Military Assistance program
                    had to be designed so not to challenge the preeminent position of the British.
                    We got off to a bad start because the first shipment of equipment to Iraq
                    consisted of reconditioned pieces. I went down to Bestrew to manage the
                    publicity for that first shipment. We were horrified when we noticed that the US
                    markings were still visible through the thin layer of paint that had been spread
                    across the equipment. The Iraqi knew than that they were getting second-hand
                    equipment and that took some of the bloom off the rose.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: We were trying to deal separately with the Kurds, although we were
                    certainly not trying to support or foster Kurdish nationalism. That was already
                    in existence. We did have an Kurdish-speaking officer stationed in the north. I
                    traveled in Kurdistan and became acquainted with the Kurdish leaders. We
                    couldn't possibly not be aware of the Kurdish independent spirit and of the Arab
                    resentment of our policy of dealing with the Kurds. I remember one evening
                    having a party for Ministry of Education officials in Baghdad when all of a
                    sudden a whole group — seven or eight — Kurds dropped in on the party. We had to
                    put them at one end of the garden while we continued with the Education
                    officials at the other end. There was no mixing of the two groups.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>The Shiites in the South made no bones about their desire for separatism. We
                    tried to reach them. I made visits to both of their holy cities. Loy Henderson
                    had promised an Encyclopedia Britannica to a cultural group. He wrote me from
                    Tehran, where he was our Ambassador, and asked me to take a set down to this
                    group because he never had a chance to get around to doing it. We had a Shiite
                    Arab translator in the Arab, whom I asked to set up this gift ceremony. He set
                    it up with another group with which he was friendly with a somewhat similar
                    name. I went to the town, somewhat suspicious. I asked to see the book in which
                    Loy Henderson had signed his name; of course, it turned out that this group
                    didn't have it. We ultimately found the group that did have it and made the
                    presentation. I am sure that the encyclopedia went on a dusty book- shelf and
                    probably remained unopened till its demise. I always resented that because it
                    cost me $180 out of the USIS' budget.</p>
                <p>I might just mention in closing that during my tour we saw the development of the
                    Baath Party. We were apprehensive about that development because we viewed it as
                    a threat to the existing regime. I had a friend who was a member of the Party.
                    Hermann and others were watching it closely. We were trying to learn as much
                    about it as we could.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: The US tried to build a Middle East defense organization around Nasser.
                    There were some very acrimonious exchanges between Ambassador Jefferson Caffery
                    in Cairo and Ambassador Waldemar Gallman in Baghdad about the development of a
                    Middle East defense organization. Caffery felt very strongly that we shouldn't
                    proceed with the Baghdad Pact without Nasser's participation. He thought that
                    was a dangerous policy. Nuri Said was very suspicious of Nasser. I don't
                    remember there being in Baghdad the same public adulation of Nasser as I
                    encountered in Libya later. We had mixed feelings about Nasser. In November
                    1952, after I had returned to Baghdad after the burning of the USIS building, I
                    was assigned to take Senator Guy Gillette of Iowa on a trip through the Arab
                    world and Israel. That was about nine months after the revolution in Egypt. We
                    went to Cairo and met with the Revolutionary Council. We were greatly impressed
                    with the group. Nasser did not particularly stand out at the time, but he was
                    clearly one of the articulate members. We were impressed with the Council's
                    plans for Egypt's future — bringing it into the modern world. The Council did
                    not dwell as much as other Arab leaders did on the problem of Israel. So many
                    Americans had the impression at the time that Egypt was being governed by a new
                    wave of Arab leaders dedicated to modernization which if not meriting
                    necessarily our outright support, as least should not be opposed. On the same
                    trip, I was once again made aware of Israeli power in the American political
                    system and its ability to impress Congress. We went to Cairo, Beirut, Damascus,
                    Amman and to Jerusalem through the Mandelbaum Gate. We stayed at the King David
                    Hotel. Except in Cairo, the Senator had been forced to listen to long diatribes
                    about America's support for Israel. By the time he got to Jerusalem, he was fed
                    up with that standard line. We arrived at the hotel late at night and went to
                    bed. In the morning. We went to breakfast where we met by a young man from the
                    Israeli Foreign Ministry who welcomed the Senator to his country. He told the
                    Senator that there were twelve people from Iowa staying at the hotel that day.
                    He thought that the Senator might wish to meet them while he was in Jerusalem.
                    He added that a program had been developed which would permit the Senator to
                    meet all the key Israeli leaders, but time had been left on the schedule to
                    permit the Senator to spend a little time with is constituents. It was like and
                    day when compare to his experiences in Arab capitals, where we had difficulty in
                    arranging appointments, where he had been the recipient of diatribes, where it
                    was obvious that no attention had been given at all to the American political
                    system; it was 180 degrees different in Jerusalem.</p>

                    That left me the Arabian Peninsula. The Office for Middle Eastern Affairs was at
                    the time was a relatively small office. We all worked very closely together. A
                    crisis in the general area would involve everybody. A desk officer had
                    responsibilities then that a country director has now. In the Bureau, there were
                    only two deputies and the office directors were the king-pins. Fraser Wilkins

                <p>We went through two major crises during my tour in NE. First came the Suez crisis

                    today, desk officers were dealing directly with the Secretary of State on
                    issues. Even if your responsibilities were for the Arabian Peninsula, you might
                    be drawn into the affairs of any other part of the Near East region just because
                    of the need to deal with crises. At this time, the Near East Bureau covered the
                    Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Egypt. The Sudan was
                    in NE, but I don't remember if Libya was; it had just acquired its independence.
                    Algeria was part of France and therefore in EUR's jurisdiction. Morocco and
                    Tunisia achieved independence in 1956. Roughly around that time, EUR set up a
                    new deputy assistant secretary for Africa. Joe Satterthwaite was the first. The

                        What was it and what role did the Department and you specifically play in
                        that matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Buraymi Oasis was an oasis of approximately nine villages south of
                    Abu Dhabi, perhaps 200 miles. Traditionally, the allegiance of the villagers to
                    rulers of the area had been determined by where they paid a Muslim tax (the
                    Saccat). Three of the villages had traditionally paid it to Saudi Arabia, three
                    to the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and three to the ruler of Abu Dhabi. In the
                    early 1950s, the often bitter division between the British and Americans over
                    the exploration rights to Gulf oil was still very much alive. I have forgotten
                    what triggered the Oasis dispute because I came into at about mid-point. Saudi
                    Arabia, by some construction of where people paid taxes, laid claim to all of
                    the Oasis. The Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO) which was a combine of
                    Standard of New York, Standard of New Jersey, Texaco and Standard of California
                    had an Arab research department that became the research arm of the Saudi
                    Arabian government in support to its claim to the Oasis. Leading the ARAMCO
                    effort was George Renze, who wrote a lot of the material supporting the Saudi
                    claim. He was strongly supported by James Terry Duce, the ARAMCO Vice President
                    for governmental affairs. Their involvement in this matter was bitterly resented
                    not only by the British, but also by two of the partner companies who were also
                    members of the Iraq petroleum consortium which was allied to British Petroleum
                    and Companie General Petrolium of France. These two companies had concessions in
                    the Gulf. By the time I got on the desk, the dispute over the Oasis had been
                    referred to international arbitration. This tribunal was headed by Sir Reeder
                    Buller, a Britisher. The tribunal had memorials presented to it. The Saudi
                    tribunal member was a Syrian, Sheik Yussuf Yassin, who was one of the four
                    senior counselors to King Abdulla. The British accused the Saudis of trying to
                    subvert the tribunal through bribery. The Saudis in turn, accused the ruler of
                    Abu Dhabi of doing the same thing. The American government was sort of in the
                    middle of all this. My Office, soon after I came on board, saw a constant stream
                    of Duce and George Rentz and their attorneys, representatives of the British
                    Embassy, Secony, Mobil and Standard of New Jersey (later ESSO), all trying to
                    give their views. We were trying to stay out of it so we could be in the
                    middle.</p>
                <p>One day, after Duce had been in, I got a call soon thereafter from the Vice
                    President of Standard of New Jersey, asking whether Duce had been in to see me.
                    That was an interesting question since Duce was the Vice President of one of
                    Standard's subsidiaries. I acknowledged that Duce had been in. The Vice
                    President then said that I was not to pay any attention to Duce because his
                    position did not represent Standard's. So were hearing from all sides.</p>
                <p>In what I always felt was somewhat of precursor to later Suez events, the British
                    got fed up with the tribunal and in October, 1955, the Omani scouts moved in and
                    took over all of the Saudi claimed three villages. The Omanis then asserted
                    dominance over the whole Oasis. Saudi Arabia broke relationships with the
                    British which were not re-established for many years.</p>
                <p>There was also another Saudi dispute with Abu Dhabi over a small parcel of land
                    near the coast between Qatar and what is now the UAE. Ultimately, the Saudis
                    lost that dispute. The British-Saudi relations were very bad at the time. The
                    British considered that Faisal, who was first the Foreign Minister and later the
                    King, was very pro-Nasser.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>I had another interesting experience during this period. Until 1956, that is
                    pre-Suez crisis, we had not had a resident mission in Yemen. We dealt with Yemen
                    from our Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The Capital of the Kingdom of Yemen
                    was not in Sanaa at the time, but in Ta'izz, which was in the south. The Imam of
                    Yemen did not trust the northern tribes and tried to isolate them from the rest
                    of the world. Because of rumors of Soviet and Romanian efforts to find oil in
                    Yemen, we wanted to open a resident mission. Ambassador George Wadsworth was
                    sent from Jeddah to see whether a mission could be opened. He ran into some
                    obstacles that we in Washington were not quite able to understand. I was asked
                    to go to Ta'izz to see whether I could get a mission opened. Mike Sterner, at
                    the time a member of the Aden Consulate staff, along with his wife Coco and a
                    Aden local employee and I made the trip by land rover to Ta'izz. It was 110
                    kilometers and took us eleven hours. It was a very bad road over British
                    territory. Although I had a visa for Yemen issued by the Yemeni legation in
                    Washington, I was told in Aden that it was not valid and that I would have to
                    get the personal approval by the Imam to enter Yemen. The personal permission
                    consisted of a little piece of paper torn out of a notebook, on which, in
                    Arabic, the Imam's representative in Yemen had scribbled something. With that
                    note, we entered the country.</p>
                <p>Dick Seiner wrote a book on Yemen, which he began by saying that Yemen was
                    rushing head-long into the 13th. Century. That was a long time ago. When you
                    went to Ta'izz, you stayed only at the Imam's guest house; there were no other
                    accommodations. And that was third rate flop-house. One room had brocade
                    furniture in it; that was the VIP room. I did not get that one. Mike, Coco and I
                    stayed at the guest house. We met with a marvelous Yemeni, who was the
                    vice-Foreign Minister. We met sitting in the lounge of the guest house. We must
                    have met three or four times. I explained our interest in opening a legation in
                    Yemen. After the second or third meeting, I said to Mohammed, the Aden Arab we
                    had brought with us, that there must be something about our discussions that I
                    was missing. I thought there was a hidden impediment and if I could find out
                    what that was, maybe we could overcome it. Mohammed said:” It is the village.” I
                    didn't understand. He explained that as we sat in the lounge looking through the
                    window, we could see a village on a hill. He said that when Ambassador Wadsworth
                    was here previously, he talked to the Vice-Minister and told him that the US
                    wanted to build the finest legation in Ta'izz and pointed to that village as
                    being a marvelous location for the US Legation. Mohammed said that the Yemenis
                    didn't want to move the village. So in my next conversation with the
                    Vice-Minister, I told him that I understood what the problem was. Our great
                    Ambassador from Jeddah had very expansive ideas — in fact, Wadsworth ran an
                    Embassy like a royal court. I told the Vice-Minister that the US government had
                    no intention of making Yemen move its villages and that we would build or occupy
                    any land or building that the Government of Yemen wished us o occupy. That
                    overcame the impediment and we subsequently opened a resident mission in
                    Ta'izz.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>You couldn't leave Ta'izz without the Imam's permission. The gates of the city
                    were locked at night. Also, as we drove into Ta'izz, we passed through a narrow
                    gorge; as we looked up, there we saw a huge boulder teetering on a precipice. I
                    was told that the boulder was there to that is the Imam wanted to block the
                    road, it could be done very easily by pushing the bolder down the hill-side. The
                    Imam had two DC-3s flown by Swedish pilots. That was the only air transportation
                    in and out of Ta'izz. At the time in Ta'izz was French diplomat, Roger Lascos,
                    living in the brocade room in the guest house. He had been in Yemen before in
                    1947 to negotiate a highway contract. He wanted to go north to renew
                    acquaintances with some people he had met on his previous trip to Yemen. He put
                    in a request for a ride on one of the DC-3s, but got no answer for several days.
                    Finally, one day he was told he could fly to Sanaa. That he did and was met by a
                    representative of the government and taken to the guest house there. He told
                    that representative whom he wanted to see. That seemed to be no problem, but
                    first he had to pay his respects to the governor. Unfortunately, the governor
                    was out of town, but the Frenchman could see him as soon as he returned. So he
                    waited for several days. One morning, there was a knock on the door and someone
                    announced that the plane to take him back to Ta'izz was ready and waiting. He
                    said that he had not seen anyone, but was told that it was the Imam's wish that
                    he return to Ta'izz. So he flew back to Ta'izz where he found out that the only
                    reason he was given permission to fly to Sanaa was because his brocade room was
                    required to accommodate a Chinese Communist representative who had come to call
                    on the Imam. That was Yemen in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your evaluation of what the CHICOMs were doing in
                        the Middle East in this period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Eisenhower administration had deep concern for this matter. In
                    looking back on it, it may have been excessive, but in the atmosphere of the
                    time, there was deep concern for what both the Chinese and the Soviets were
                    doing. We are talking now about a geographic area that we and the British had
                    always considered as our primary domain. It was in 1955, that the Czech's arms
                    deal with Nasser was revealed. We had established the Baghdad Pact. There was an
                    intense feeling for the strategic importance of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, the
                    straits of Bab al Mandeb — the choke points. As the desk officer at the time, I
                    was reflecting that policy orientation. The Chinese were effective in relating
                    to the Yemenis with primitive technology that we couldn't match. We had problems
                    with the inflexibility of our assistance programs which were not suited with
                    difficult areas like Yemen.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>The Eisenhower doctrine and the Middle East resolution of 1956, partially
                    relating to Yemen, was conceived in the Department as a means of achieving
                    greater Congressional flexibility in the administration of assistance programs
                    in the Middle East in the face of Chinese, Soviet and other communist efforts.
                    Once that resolution was approved by Congress, it was then seen by the
                    Administration as a) a way to employ a defeated Congressman — James P. Richards,
                    Jr., who had been the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — and b) a
                    way for the nations of the region to stand up and be counted. Richards, with
                    Jack Jernegan, made a trip throughout the area, to determine which countries
                    would endorse the Eisenhower doctrine. In exchange for support, those countries
                    would be given a share of a special appropriation of $200 million. When Richards
                    Jernegan got to Yemen, Jack sent a telegram which started by saying that their
                    batting average had just dropped because in Yemen, they had met with the Imam
                    and have promised a $2 million assistance program in exchange for support of the
                    President's doctrine. The Imam wanted to know how many countries the US team was
                    visiting. The answer was 14. Then he wanted to know the amount appropriated by
                    Congress. He then said that is mathematics would suggest that Yemen, on a
                    country-by-country allocation, would be eligible for much more than $2 million.
                    He said he wanted his “fair share”. When Jernegan explained that the amount
                    mentioned was related to a country's capacity to absorb the aid effectively, the
                    Imam got up and walked out. So that was the end of assistance to Yemen for the
                    time being, at least.</p>

                        period?</hi>

                <p>NEWSOM: Abdul Aziz died in 1953. He was succeeded by his son, Saud bin Abdul
                    Aziz, who was a great hulk of a man with poor eyesight. He made a memorable
                    visit to the United States in 1957. Wadsworth was still our Ambassador to Saudi
                    at the time. The rule then, as it is still now, was that the head of state could
                    have 12 persons with him for whom the US government would pay expenses in
                    Washington. Wadsworth protested that 12 was not enough for a king. We finally
                    agreed that His Majesty could bring 40 people, but would only pay for some of
                    them. We sent Victor Purse out to insure that no more than 40 boarded the ship
                    that would bring the party to the United States. We did not realize that the
                    ship would dock at Cannes where another 40 Saudis boarded. The Saudi party, by
                    the time it reached New York was over 80 people. We had to pare that down. Blair
                    House was occupied by the King and his immediate entourage. The rest were put in
                    the Shoreham, except for the King's bodyguards who were bedded down in tents
                    pitched in Lafayette Square. The Royal party was expected to stay in Washington
                    three days; it stayed nine days. During those nine days, we negotiated an
                    extension on our use of the Dhahran airport. Robert Murphy, then Under Secretary
                    of State, was supposed to be our chief negotiator; Yussuf Yassin was the Saudi
                    negotiator — the same man who handled the Oasis tribunal. After one session,
                    Murphy decided that he didn't want any more and therefore established a drafting
                    committee and made me the chairman. It is we who had to meet with Yassin
                    thereafter. So I negotiated with that wily Syrian for four days and nights and
                    managed to squeeze out another five year extension. That was the last extension.
                    That experience was useful because I learned a lot about negotiating in those
                    four days.</p>
                <p>Then the whole atmosphere, which had been reasonably amicable, was marred by
                    apparition of the Straits of Tiran which came up during the last couple of days
                    of the King's visit. Herman Fleiger, the Department's Legal advisor — a man very
                    close to Dulles — had been asked to render an opinion on the rights of Israeli
                    transit of the Gulf of Aqaba waters. This came after the Suez incident. Fleiger
                    ruled that the Straits were international waters because we at the time still
                    supported the “three mile limit” rule. In the Straits, the three mile limit
                    overlapped from opposite shores, but in the Gulf, there was an area which we
                    considered international waters. Straits leading to international waters were
                    also considered as “open” waterways. The Saudis were much opposed to this
                    interpretation. So the ruling became a very contentious issue, but it did not
                    fortunately interfere with the Dhahran airport extension. We did make additional
                    commitments to Saudi Arabia during this visit which effected our relationships
                    ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view the stability of the house of Saud in
                        Saudi Arabia? I ask that question because this was the period when Nasserism
                        was at its heights?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I concluded then and I have maintained the view that as long as the sons
                    of Abdul Aziz were still available to assume the throne in turn and as long
                    there wasn't any competition from other branches of the family, the Saudi
                    kingdom was relatively secure. Even the deposition of Saud and the later
                    assassination of Faisal did not dent the cohesion of the royal family.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Saud was sad figure. He always reminded me of King Lear in a way. He was almost
                    blind, heavy set, not very smart. I went to see him after he had been deposed. I
                    had gotten to know him quite well during the nine days in the Blair House. When
                    I went to see him, he was in the ARAMCO hospital, in a little room, essentially
                    unaware of what had transpired. He had somewhat vacant stare with his semi-blind
                    eyes. It was a very sad picture. Faisal was much impressive. His death was a
                    tragedy. Neither Hollech or Fahd were brilliant, but they kept the kingdom
                    together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was during the period we are discussing that the Suez
                        crisis erupted. William Rountree was the Assistant Secretary for the Near
                        East. How did NEA view this situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The first thing we noticed was that Willy Morris, who was officer in the
                    British Embassy responsible for Middle East affairs, stopped coming to see us.
                    That began about a week before the Suez crisis began. Some years later, while
                    dining with Willy in London, I asked him why he stopped seeing us. He said that
                    he was getting instructions from London which the Ambassador and the Washington
                    Embassy staff thought were absurd. That led them to believe that something was
                    cooking, but they didn't feel they could share their insights with us. So they
                    decided to break contacts until the situation became clearer. We still had
                    exchanges in London and we may have had suspicions of potential actions, but no
                    real evidence. Some years ago, I attended a seminar in Princeton on the “Dulles
                    era”. Bob Amery, Bob Bowie and Douglas Dillon were there along with others who
                    had gone through the Suez crisis. There was considerable discussion about
                    whether the US had in fact received advance knowledge of British-French plans.
                    Dillon, who had been our Ambassador in Paris at the time, claimed that he had
                    warned the White House that the French would use force. Bowie, who was in Policy
                    Planning in the Department at the time, said that there had not been any advance
                    warning of which he was aware. At my low level, we certainly had no awareness of
                    coming events beyond a growing realization of the bitterness that Eden felt
                    towards Dulles. In August, 1956, I had accompanied Robert Anderson, who had been
                    Secretary of the Treasury, with Bill Edlan of CIA on a secret mission to the
                    Arabian Peninsula and Egypt, to try to sell the idea of a Suez Canal users
                    association. We had stopped in London, where Dulles was trying to negotiate with
                    the British on this idea. I became the note-taker in a meeting between Dulles
                    and Lloyd, the Foreign Minister. I don't ever recall a meeting between two top
                    governmental officials which was as acrimonious and cool as that one was. So
                    even before the crisis, there was real antagonism between the British and us. So
                    that something happened without notification to us was not entirely
                    surprising.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>We all admired the position that Eisenhower took. We were in full agreement with
                    those British who said that the invasion was a foolhardy adventure particularly
                    if it represented a long-term commitment to a British presence in the area. I
                    don't think any of us, knowing what we did, felt that Nasser was going to
                    collapse and be overthrown, which of course was the objective of
                    British-French-Israeli policy. In retrospect, it is interesting to note that our
                    position was probably the boldest one we ever took in support of an Arab cause
                    and yet we realized very short-lived benefits in the Arab world from our
                    stance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was NEA feeling any pressure from the Israeli lobby or
                        Congress during this period or was that pressure applied at higher levels in
                        the Department and the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Israeli lobby was in existence, but it was not the organization that
                    AIPAC became later. Don Bergus dealt with the Israeli lobby and can answer that
                    question more authoritatively than me. There was man named Fisher, a California
                    oil executive, was very close to Dulles and talked to him often. Certainly
                    Eisenhower did not pay much attention to that lobby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That raises the question of the Eisenhower-Dulles
                        relationships which seems to be under intense scrutiny at the moment. From
                        your view point, did you have any feeling about that relationships as it
                        related to Middle East policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: At the time, I guess I had the feeling that Dulles was calling the shots,
                    but as I look back on those days there was a feature of Dulles' office that I
                    have not seen in any other Secretary of State's office. On Dulles' desk and on
                    his conference table, where he did a lot of work, Dulles had a phone that
                    connected directly with the Oval Office. Periodically, he used to pick it up and
                    talk to the President, in the middle of a conference. I don't remember any other
                    Secretary for whom I worked who had that kind of direct access or control
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>One day, when Joe Satterthwaite and some of us were meeting with Dulles, that
                    Eisenhower-Dulles phone rang. Dulles answered it and said that he didn't know,
                    but that there was someone in the office who could answer the President's
                    question. So he gave the phone to Satterthwaite, who said: “Enkruma! No, no.
                    Enkruma. “N” like in “nuts”! That is right, Mr. President” and handed the phone
                    back to Dulles”. I think in general that Eisenhower was clearly calling the
                    shots, when he was well.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Dulles was an interesting man. He had his own ideas. I will always remember one
                    meeting with him after my return from the Anderson mission. That was in
                    August/September 1956. We were briefing him on our conversations in various
                    countries. Dulles sat back and thinking out loud, said something that area of
                    the world being very difficult and indicating some doubts that he would ever be
                    able to understand it. I think that showed that he was striving for certain
                    results, he had come to the recognition that there were forces in the Middle
                    East that he didn't fully understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The next major event took place in July, 1958. I refer to
                        the Iraq-Lebanon dispute. Tell us you memories of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: By that time, Iraq was no longer the responsibility of my office. I think
                    Dick Parker was the desk officer for Iraq, but we were all involved in the
                    handling of the Iraq revolution and its aftermath. That took place in July,
                    1958. I remember that I was chosen, along with Bill Macomber, to brief the
                    Senate Foreign Relations and the House Foreign Affairs Committees every day for
                    three weeks on events in Iraq. That was interesting for several reasons.</p>
                <p>First, it demonstrated to me how different the perspectives of the Senate and the
                    House were, at least in a foreign affairs crisis. The House was interested in
                    the immediate and its impact on their home districts. The Senate was prepared to
                    look at the longer term. At that time, you still have an executive session in
                    the Senate without, as is the case now, having to go through a prolonged
                    negotiation on what can be revealed and what can't be. So executive sessions
                    could be quite open and candid. I remember especially the Senate sessions. One
                    reason was that the Chairman was Senator Theodore Green, who was by 1958, in his
                    dotage. He was in his '90s and lucid only for short periods of time. That made
                    briefings a little difficult. Highboard Humphreys was on the Committee. He was
                    alert and sharp. Because he was not trying to impress his audience, he asked
                    very penetrating questions. Fulbright was also on the Committee, but he was
                    angry with Dulles and at one point, stomped out of the briefings because he said
                    that he didn't want a party to “star-chamber” proceedings. The Committees were
                    interested in the progress of the landing of the Marines, why we were not better
                    informed of the over-throw of the monarchy (the same question we have had to try
                    to answer after every revolution) and the significance of that. We briefed the
                    Committees on the Robert Murphy mission which was one of the more successful
                    actions of American diplomacy, despite our unhappiness with our Ambassador in
                    Lebanon, Rob McClintock. He thought he could solve the problem, until he was
                    quoted as saying that the Lebanese Minister of Finance could hang from the
                    nearest tree. I was with Mr. Dulles shortly after that comment was made; the
                    Secretary said that it was like having Babe Ruth on your team — he strikes out
                    quite often, but every once in a while he hits a home run. Murphy negotiated a
                    resolution of the Lebanese problem and the withdrawal of the Syrian troops.
                    Interestingly enough, the man who asked for the troops in the first place —
                    Camille Jamal — was not put in power, but rather a Lebanese military man was
                    chosen as President. We couldn't reverse the revolution in Iraq — Kassam and his
                    bloody shirt.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>The only interesting sidelight that I remember of those events was the deft work
                    of the French who managed to preserve their oil interests in Iraq. Five percent
                    of the Iraq Petroleum Company was owned an Armenian family, Gulbenkian; the
                    other 95% was split four ways: the French company, British Petroleum, New Jersey
                    Standard and SOCONY Mobil. Kassam nationalized the Iraq Petroleum Company, but
                    the French persuaded him to let them keep their shares. They then argued that
                    were saving Western interests in Iraq because there was no way any of the other
                    parties could maintain their interests. The French are always our staunchest
                    allies in tough crises!</p>
                <p>I left NEA in 1959. In the previous year, we tried to recover our interests in
                    Iraq, but the Baghdad Pact became CENTO. The British had to withdraw from
                    Habania — a military base they used in Iraq. The British were in general pulling
                    our east of Suez. We believed that we had to fill that vacuum. We did that until
                    Kissinger took over by taking some modest measures like establishing consular
                    posts in the Gulf, beefing up slightly our naval presence in Bahrain with two
                    AVPs (aircraft tenders — the Greenwich Bay and the Valcour). We did add also a
                    couple of destroyers and increased the Sixth Fleet visits to the area. We wrote
                    letters to the Kings of Saudi Arabia emphasizing our deep interest in
                    maintaining the integrity of their country and its independence. I drafted a
                    number of them for Presidential signature. It is no wonder that the Saudis
                    expected some action from us when they were threatened.</p>
                <p>We had extensive written exchanges with the British during this period concerning
                    the Gulf and its future. The question of military assistance to Kuwait arose
                    because Kassam raised the Iraqi claim to Kuwait shortly after the revolution.
                    They landed some troops in Kuwait and provided some equipment — tanks, etc. We
                    tried to work with Kassam, but weren't very successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time of the Marine landing, did we perceive
                        Nasserism as a major threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Certainly, but we were always a little ambivalent about Nasser. There
                    were some, including some of our Ambassadors in Cairo, who felt that Nasser did
                    represent a new and perhaps irreversible trend of nationalism and modernism in
                    the arab world. We were very much influence in our attitude towards Nasser by
                    the British who, before 1956, had a deep antipathy towards the man and his point
                    of view. But the British government was also split. When I went to Yemen on the
                    trip I described earlier, I spent a few days in Aden. I was privileged to attend
                    a staff meeting chaired by the governor of Aden. Just prior to that, for the
                    first time, the Foreign Office had assigned one of its staff members, Horace
                    Phillips, to the Governor's staff. Phillips later became British ambassador to
                    Saudi Arabia and other posts. I was kind of a “fly on the wall” while the
                    Governor and Phillips debated how much of a threat Nasser was to Aden. Phillips
                    took a much more benign view of Nasser than the Governor did.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>One of the reasons why Aden became the home of a Marxist movement was when the
                    British decided to give Aden its independence, they made a conscious choice to
                    support the leftist labor elements because they viewed those as anti-Nasser. The
                    opposition was Arab nationalistic and therefore less trusted by the British who
                    had a phobia about Nasser. That explains a good deal about what happened
                    later.</p>
                <p>Many of the Arabs, including many Saudis, took the position that we should not be
                    so concerned about Arab nationalism and Nasser because it was Islamic and a
                    natural bulwark against communism. Some of us regarded that as nonsense. In
                    fact, Islam itself is a highly authoritarian religion, but many Arabs felt that
                    it was not a danger to Western interests. Many people in the Department espoused
                    the same view. Nasser was a threat not only because he was close to the Soviets
                    from whom he was receiving military equipment and training, but he was also
                    viewed as the primary force for anti-Americanism threatening our interests in
                    Libya, the Arabian Peninsula, Lebanon and in other parts of the area. So he was
                    a danger to us beyond the Cold War context; he was a problem to our interests in
                    the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question about this period. How did you view the
                        so-called Arabists in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I studied Arabic every work day morning in Iraq while serving there.
                    Later, in London, while stationed there, I also took some lessons and studied
                    the language and the culture again when I assigned to Libya. I was rated 2-2+ on
                    the FSI scale which was satisfying for someone who never had formal training.
                    But I was not considered an Arabist. I think that the popular view of the
                    Arabists is very much misplaced. Many of those who dealt consistently with the
                    Arab world — I refer specifically to many of my colleges who were in NE at this
                    time — were very critical of and in many cases, completely turned off, by the
                    Arab governments then in power. They did recognize that US interests would not
                    be served by a complete alienation of the Arab world. The Middle East
                    specialists made themselves vulnerable to charges of parochialism and bias when,
                    during Congressional testimony and briefings, they tried to explain how the Arab
                    world looked at the creation of Israel and how it looked at American policy
                    towards Israel. There were many pro-Israeli people who were simply not prepared
                    to have that point of view expressed. So the Middle East specialist was in a
                    very uncomfortable position. A canard grew that American policy was not more
                    favorable to Israel because of a cabal of Arabists in the State Department. The
                    reason that the policy has not been more favorable, as the current Bush
                    administration is demonstrating — an administration that has relied very little
                    on the Arabists — is because of the perception of where US interests lie.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left your NEA position in 1959. Then you went to the
                        War College for a year. Was that a valuable experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes. It certainly gave me a better appreciation of the military point of
                    view. The contacts I made and the perceptions I gained were of great value in
                    jobs I held later. In London, I held the Middle East “portfolio”; I was also the
                    Political Adviser to the CINC of CINCNELM, a command that has subsequently been
                    dissolved. That command covered the Mediterranean and all the land to India. I
                    traveled with him. My War College experience was very valuable. The first time I
                    went to see Admiral Smith, he told me that he did not take orders from the
                    Department of State, but was quite willing to look at and probably accept any
                    sensible analysis that I might present. I fully understood, in light my year at
                    the War College, the state of the mind I was dealing with.</p>
                <p>The contacts I made during the year at the College were both personally
                    satisfying and professionally very helpful. David Jones was at the War College
                    when I was there. We met again when I was Under Secretary and he was the
                    Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Our personal relationships allowed us to cut
                    through an enormous amount of potential red tape. Russ Daugherty, also a
                    classmate, later became CINC, US Air Forces-Europe when I was in Libya. We were
                    then concerned about Wheelus Air Force base. So the year at the War College was
                    very valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in London from 1960 to 1962. What were your
                        responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Ever since the end of World War II, we had a job in London to be filled
                    by an officer with Middle East experience to deal with the British Foreign
                    Office and other British Ministries on Middle East issues. Similarly, the
                    British have a Middle East expert in their Embassy in Washington. My job was to
                    follow events in that region, keep in touch with Foreign Office officials and
                    report in their views. I arranged for briefings for American officials who were
                    going to the area and who wanted to meet British officials. I kept in contact
                    with some British journalists and academics who dealt with the Middle East. That
                    gave me a sense how various segments of British society viewed events important
                    to us and allowed me introduce interested Americans to those circles. As I
                    mentioned, I traveled to the region with Admiral Smith, probably twice or three
                    times during my tour.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Then by a curious set of circumstances, I also became involved in Africa. We did
                    have an African expert in the Embassy, Fred Hutzel. The early '60s were very
                    active years in US-British relations on African concerns because this was the
                    period when African countries were beginning their journey to and of
                    independence. The Rhodesian issue first arose during this period. Fred was
                    detailed as Political adviser to a Naval Task Force which was making a series of
                    good will visits on the West African coast. One day, a Portuguese ocean liner —
                    the Santa Rosa — was hijacked. The ship to which Fred was assigned was detached
                    from the flotilla to move as rapidly as possible to intercept the Santa Rosa.
                    Then Fred was off-loaded in Recife, Brazil and was ill for several weeks. During
                    that period, the Congo crisis erupted in which the British were very interested.
                    So I was thrown into African affairs until Fred could return. I got to know G.
                    Mennen “Soapy” Williams, the then Assistant Secretary for African Affairs and
                    Wayne Fredericks, his deputy.</p>
                <p>I was supposed to go to Cairo as DCM after my London tour. It was a job that I
                    was very interested in. Governor Williams asked me if I would like to return to
                    Washington to work in the African Bureau. I told him I would prefer Cairo. Of
                    course, the next word from the Department was that I had been appointed as
                    Deputy Director for the Office of North African Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that, I would like to hear you compare
                        the British and American views of the Middle East in the early '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: We are now discussing a period which was only four years after Suez.
                    There was still considerable bitterness, particularly among Conservative MPs. I
                    remember making a speech on US Middle East policy to the Chelsea Conservative
                    Society. I was roundly heckled who had a very different view of what that policy
                    should have been. In the Foreign Office, I encountered a very friendly and
                    sympathetic attitude towards cooperation and towards our view of the Middle
                    East. We did have somewhat different views on Nasser which became central t our
                    discussions of Saudi Arabia. The British, which had broken relations with Saudi
                    Arabia, were very suspicious of Faisal. We were encouraging them to take another
                    look at that. The Foreign Office and British military were very suspicious of
                    our growing activities in the Gulf and particularly what we were doing in Muscat
                    and Oman. That had been a British province. We struck some raw nerves when we
                    began to discuss the sale of some military equipment to Gulf countries. The
                    equipment meant military advisors, who then were also asked for views on large
                    military contracts. The British saw these factors as threatening to their
                    position in the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>We were also at the beginning of the Kennedy administration and not all of the
                    British were enthusiastic about the definite Kennedy tilt towards the new
                    independence movements in Africa. During the early '60s, the Lancaster House
                    negotiations on Kenya independence took place. We followed that closely. Within
                    the Embassy, there was a generational spilt. The Political Counselor was Elim
                    O'Shaughnessy. His view of the world stopped at Belgrade, where he had been DCM.
                    South and East of there was of no consequence. Once, I took a long airgram to
                    him which analyzed the British views of the future of Saudi Arabia. Elim looked
                    at it and said: “David, does anybody give a damn about what happens in Saudi
                    Arabia?” London was a great experience which made me much more aware why our
                    conduct of foreign affairs is so much more complicated than the British process
                    and that of other countries probably. They do not have to deal with the
                    Parliament as we have to deal with the Congress. The government is part of
                    Parliament, in effect. They do have a “Question hour” but for example no serious
                    budgetary hearings, or no restrictions on the management of their assistance
                    programs. When you consider what a desk officer in the Department has to take
                    into account in pursuing an initiative and the number of people he has to
                    negotiate with compared to an equivalent Foreign Office official, you can see
                    the enormous difference. That in part explains why we need 80 people in and aid
                    mission overseas while the British need only four or five. We have just so many
                    more constituencies to satisfy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there similar split in Great Britain between the
                        foreign affairs specialists and the political leadership as there was in the
                        United States? The literature is replete with writings by and about the
                        British Foreign Service's pro-Arab bias, particularly for the desert Arabs.
                        Did you find that to be true and what were the Parliamentarians' views?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Suez crisis demonstrated the split between the British who had
                    experience in the region and at least some of the politicians. That split was
                    still visible in the early '60s. The authors of the often romantic stories and
                    books about the Middle East were rarely promoted to policy making levels in the
                    British Foreign Office. The British had some superb “Arabists” at the higher
                    policy levels, but they were not parochial advocates. One of them was Donald
                    Maitland, who was with us in Baghdad and later became the British Ambassador to
                    the EC and later to UN and after that Under Secretary of the Department of
                    Energy — one of the rare Foreign Service officers to serve in a domestic
                    Department in London. He had started as Consul in Al Amhara between Basra and
                    Baghdad. He had the most superb knowledge of Iraqi society, the family linkages,
                    etc. He spoke superb Arabic. He never lost his slightly caustic objectivity
                    towards the people of the Middle East. The best in any professional service
                    maintain a certain psychological distance from their the societies they have
                    studies and know well.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Kennedy administration took over, did you detect
                        any change in our Middle East policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Kennedy administration seemed to be the only post-war administration
                    that was not involved in a serious effort to resolve the Arab-Israel dispute. I
                    should have mentioned, when talking about Secretary Dulles, the ALFA program,
                    which was a secret effort sponsored by Dulles to see if a package of
                    compensation for land lost, voluntary repatriation and adjustment of borders
                    would not provide a base for Middle East peace. Dulles decided, on August 26,
                    1955, that his program was going anywhere; so he made his proposals public in a
                    speech which brought the effort to an end. I don't recall Kennedy making any
                    similar effort. The next major effort came out of the LBJ administration with
                    Resolution 242. The Kennedy period was not very active.</p>
                <p>One thing did happen although I was not directly involved. Until about 1960, the
                    US was not a major supplier of arms to Israel or to any country in the area. The
                    tripartite declaration was still theoretically in effect which limited France,
                    Great Britain and the United States in their military assistance programs in the
                    area. By the early 60, there were already transactions made that were perhaps
                    not in the spirit of the agreement, although they were not a serious problem at
                    the time.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Correct. My boss was Bill Whitman. In 1963, I became the director of the

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me start by asking for your impressions of Governor
                        “Soapy” Williams and Wayne Fredericks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: “Soapy” took the job took the job believing that Africa was a black
                    political precinct as he knew in Detroit, which would be of political benefit to
                    him in his future career. “Soapy” was smart enough to realize that that was not
                    the case after about a year as Assistant Secretary. He recognized that
                    circumstances were entirely different and he adjusted well. On balance, while he
                    made excessive commitments and was somewhat unrealistic in his views o what the
                    United States could do in Africa. He did put the United States on the map in an
                    important way. He and Charles Diggs, a Congressman and the Chairman of the House
                    Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, paid attention to the African countries
                    as they were emerging into independence. They created an awareness in the US of
                    its interests in Africa which provided an important base for future
                    developments.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Wayne Fredericks was an earnest advocate for Africa and black Africa in
                    particular. He had worked in South Africa as a representative of Kellogg Mills
                    and had come away with a deep aversion to apartheid. He had great sympathy
                    particularly for the Anglo-phone Africans. One of the aspects of American policy
                    in the early '60s was that more often than not we paid more attention to
                    Anglo-phone Africa than we did to Franco-phone Africa. Our language commonality
                    made communications easier. The African black community paid essentially no
                    attention to Franco-phone Africa and that influenced US official views.</p>
                <p>But “Soapy”, more than Wayne, tried to establish links with Franco-phone Africa,
                    even though his French was not very good, but he gave it a valiant try. Even
                    with difficult leaders like Sekou Toure of Guinea, he tried to establish a
                    relationship. He has been criticized for establishing resident Embassies in
                    every individual African country. He felt very strongly about that and I believe
                    that has been helpful in maintaining an American presence and interest in even
                    those countries where we had nothing else to offer. I took over from “Soapy” as
                    Assistant Secretary in 1969 at a time when Congress had revolted against what it
                    viewed as excessive commitment to Africa. It placed a limit to ten countries to
                    which we could give economic assistance. It fell to me to give the bad news to
                    those countries that didn't fall among the top ten and force those countries to
                    have more realistic understanding of US capabilities. That made me even more
                    conscious of the big dreams that “Soapy” created in Africa, but on balance I
                    believe that it was important in this period of emerging nations.</p>

                    didn't have nearly as much clout in the political process as he had hoped to
                    have. They gave him a sop and hoped that he wouldn't bother them thereafter. He
                    didn't really have a close relationship to the political power brokers in
                    Washington. Despite that, he got a lot more attention for Africa that a

                    to the administration in its early years, like the US-Soviet relationships, arms
                    control discussions, the Cuba missile crisis. Africa just wasn't on their scope.

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>In retrospect, it is often amazing what issues took a lot of the bureaucracy's
                    time. One was the Tanzam railway — the Tanzania-Zambia railway — which the
                    Chinese were building. “Soapy” and Wayne made valiant efforts to try to get the
                    US to match that effort with a highway or some other large project or to make a
                    better offer. The Chinese proposal was considered a serious threat to the
                    integrity of our interests in Southern Africa. The conservatives, like the
                    Rhodesian lobby, which was a power at the time used to come to see me with maps,
                    showing red arrows pointing at the heat of Southern Africa. It was issues like
                    that which loomed large at the time.</p>
                <p>I was fortunate in my job as chief of the Northern Africa Office because “Soapy”
                    had very little interest in that part of the region. Somewhere along the line, I
                    was asked to become involved in some draft papers on regional policies. That
                    allowed me to accompany “Soapy” to a meeting he had with Averell Harriman on the
                    Tanzam railway. “Soapy” said that perhaps we could find some funding for a
                    highway which could, in the last analysis, be more economical that a railroad.
                    Harriman said that perhaps Williams with his background may think so, but that
                    he didn't! (Harriman being a scion of a great railroad family).</p>
                <p>Northern Africa was an exciting place during this period. The independence of
                    Tunisia and Morocco were already accomplished facts, but Algeria was striving
                    for its own statehood. I visited Algiers on Independence Day and I was stayed
                    with Bill Porter, who was one of our great diplomats who managed remarkably to
                    be Consul General under the French and soon thereafter, our Ambassador to the
                    newly independent nation of Algeria, who accepted him without hesitation. The
                    French disliked him intensely because when he had been Director for Northern
                    African Affairs some years earlier, he had made a point of making contact with
                    the FLN and other Algerian pro-independence groups.</p>
                <p>Developing the confidence of the new Algerian government was very difficult. It
                    viewed us with some suspicion because it felt that we had supported the French
                    in the war for independence. Our main interest in the '60s was to deliver food
                    aid to Algeria and to Egypt. Both were difficult because just as we were on the
                    verge of getting approval for both programs, Nasser made a speech refusing our
                    aid and telling us to “drink up the Red Sea”. That in fact killed both programs
                    because they were closely related in that the assistance was destined to
                    countries which were not in “our camp” and therefore there was considerable
                    opposition. A program for Egypt was a little easier to get approval because
                    there was a good feeling towards Egypt as a country; the opposition was
                    anti-Nasser. So we tried to piggy-back the Algerian program on the Egypt one,
                    but when the latter could not be developed, the former also fell through.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was President Kennedy interested in Algeria? I believe
                        that as a Senator he was the first prominent American politician to speak

                <p>NEWSOM: That is right. He was a great hero in Algeria. He had an interest in
                    Algeria after becoming President, but it went sour during a Ben Bella visit to
                    Washington. He had become the first President of Algeria. In October, just
                    before the Cuban missile crisis, he came to Washington and from there went
                    directly to Havana. That upset Kennedy and his people. Kennedy didn't pay much
                    attention to Algeria after that.</p>
                <p>The other big issue in this time period was the Horn of Africa. Somalia became
                    independent in 1960. There were growing tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia.
                    The Soviets were beginning to show interest in Somalia. Our interests in
                    Ethiopia, fostered by an Army communication station in Cagnew, Asmara, were in
                    part derivative from an emotional US attachment to Ethiopia for sending some of
                    their troops to Korea — one of the few countries to do so. I spent a substantial
                    amount of my time on Ethiopia. I worried at times about the Emperor's succession
                    which was not a particularly popular issue especially with Haile Selassie. I
                    spent endless hours trying to figure out solutions to reduce Somali-Ethiopian
                    tensions. I looked at previous border agreements between Italy and Great
                    Britain.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: That was the situation. Ethiopia did have priority because of the Army
                    installation in Asmara. I think we polarized the situation to some degree. About
                    1965, a curious thing happened. We were assuming that Somalia would end up being
                    a Soviet puppet and therefore we were giving increasingly greater support to
                    Ethiopia. Jacob Malik, then the Soviet representative at the U.N., took a trip
                    to Addis. At the time or soon thereafter, the Soviets gave the Ethiopians a $100
                    million dollar line of credit to build a hospital and a few other things. In
                    retrospect, I now think that they were smarter than we were because they were
                    hedging their bets in the Horn and not putting all their chips on one
                    country.</p>

                        Force bases there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: We were phasing them out. We were negotiating a withdrawal from all of
                    the bases, which were maintain essentially for the use of B-47s — a medium range
                    strategic bomber. When President Eisenhower had stopped in Morocco in the late
                    '50s, he made what the Moroccans considered a commitment to phase out the bases
                    once longer range bombers became the back-bone of our air fleet. By the time I
                    took over Northern African Affairs, we had already abandoned a couple of the
                    bases. We were committed to rebuild Nouasseur, which was the largest base, into
                    a major civilian airport for Casablanca. I was involved in those negotiations
                    which were difficult because the Air Force was feeling that it was being pushed
                    out of a base and didn't really have any interest in helping the Moroccans. Our
                    assistance agency had very little interest because it didn't have money it
                    wanted to spend on airports. The issue became more complicated because when we
                    pulled back from protection of the parameters of the base, the Moroccans stole
                    everything that they could get their hands on. I was dealing with a very profane
                    Under Secretary of the Air Force for Logistics — Phil Hilbert, who I had known
                    quite well because we had worked on the Dhahran issues and other matters
                    previously. He was constantly trying to tell me that those “ragheads out there”
                    didn't know how to run a base and if the Air Force was going to be kicked out,
                    you couldn't expect it to care what happened hereafter. He used to keep
                    constantly informed about the latest thieveries and deprivations. He called me
                    one morning to tell me that the Moroccans had stolen a generator and a water
                    pump out of a small brick pump house. He said furthermore, they had dismantled
                    the house brick by brick and that there wasn't a trace of it left. He said he
                    couldn't understand why I thought that these people should be helped. It was a
                    constant fight. Of course, our Air Force was also moving material out even
                    though we were obliged to leave it all behind.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: He was our friend. He was and probably still is one of the most difficult
                    friends that we have. Prior to my time as Director of North African Affairs, the
                    King had canceled at least one invitation to visit the United States. That was
                    during the Eisenhower period because he couldn't give the President a horse or
                    some other silly reason as that. He did come on a visit while I was Director. He
                    never kept any schedule. He was very smart, but very arrogant. We had a meeting
                    set up for him at the State Department to see Secretary Rusk. About half-hour
                    before the meeting time, I received a call from the Protocol Officer at Blair
                    House saying that His Majesty was not going to come to the Department, but that
                    he would be available to the Secretary sometime later, if the Secretary wished
                    to call on him at Blair House. I rushed upstairs to brief the Secretary. In
                    those days, the communications between the Secretary and the working levels was
                    very good. I had found that out even earlier as a desk officer when even from
                    that level I could get to talk to the Secretary. Certainly, as an officer
                    director, I had easy access. Rusk took it very graciously and said: “What the
                    young man wants, the young man gets! Let's go.” The King is shrewd. In
                    comparison, for example, to the Shah, he had a far better political sense on how
                    to keep his people reasonably under control and how to manipulate issues that
                    might have popular support.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our views of Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: We had some concern about possible Soviet penetration, but we were more
                    interested in Algeria as a major piece of real estate on the Mediterranean in
                    whose security we had a great interest. Particularly in the Kennedy
                    administration, there was a mystique that we could relate better to Algeria than
                    other Western countries could because we had been once a colony which had
                    liberated itself. There was a long history of contacts between American
                    diplomats — e.g. Bill Porter — and leaders of the pro-independence movements. We
                    could not exaggerate he influence of one American on our policy towards North
                    Africa. I refer to Irving Brown, the representative of the AFL-CIO in Paris. He
                    became convinced, with a lot of justification, that if American labor
                    organizations and government did not show greater interests in the emerging
                    independence movements in Franco-phone Africa, they would be swept away by the
                    left-oriented French labor organization. He felt that it was therefore very
                    important that the United States established contacts with the emerging
                    leadership, many of whom had been part of the labor movement in their own
                    countries. Irving Brown, in the early '60s, was very suspicious of the State
                    Department and almost contemptuous of the organization. It took a while to build
                    a relationship with Brown. I had the benefit of a cousin who was a professor of
                    labor economics at Harvard and a close friend of Brown's. He suggested that I
                    work to get to know Brown, which I did. Brown played a major role in letting the
                    essentially anti-western independence leaders in Algeria and Tunisia know that
                    they had alternatives in making alliances. He convinced that them that there
                    were groups in the United States that supported them in their quests for
                    independence. So Brown was a force that played an important role in our policy
                    development.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me turn to Algeria for a moment. US policy toward
                        Algeria had been the subject of major bureaucratic battles between the
                        Bureau of European Affairs, which supported the French, and the Bureau of
                        Near Eastern Affairs (there not being a Bureau for African Affairs at the
                        time), which was more inclined to support independence movements. Were there
                        any further evidence of this battle by the time you became Director for

                <p>NEWSOM: Indeed there were. The battle had just finished when I arrived. But the
                    scars of suspicion of what these Near East-Middle East-African types were doing
                    were still evident. People like George Springsteen, then Assistant Secretary for
                    Europe and formerly George Ball's special assistant, were very wary of us. I
                    tangled with him later on the issue of Portugal and its colonies when I was
                    Assistant Secretary for Africa. By the time I became Director, there wasn't much
                    the Europeanists could do because De Gaulle had really pulled the plug on
                    France's interests. There was an acute sensitivity during this period because we
                    were just beginning our involvement in Vietnam which included cooperation with
                    the French. So anything that appeared to be a slap in France's face was frowned
                    upon.</p>

                    interest anywhere in town in that area. “Soapy” Williams was so interested in

                    Bill Porter returning in Algeria in 1965 after two years there as Ambassador. He
                    had lived through many months of danger with murders on his door-steps, threats
                    against him, etc. He had a meeting with “Soapy” to brief him. Afterwards, he
                    came to my office, fuming, because he said the Governor had fallen asleep during
                    the briefing.</p>
                <p>As long as I kept people generally informed of activities in North Africa, they
                    didn't bother me. It was a great job!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We haven't mentioned Tunisia or Libya yet. Were there any
                        problems there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: We had a constant problem trying to satisfy their requests for
                    assistance. Tunisia was a country with promise. Bourguiba was a good friend with
                    whom we had excellent relations.</p>
                <p>With Libya, on the other hand, we were beginning in the 1963-64 period to become
                    concerned with its policy directions. The influence of Nasser was very strong.
                    We had an Ambassador, Allan Lightner, who had never been in the Arab world
                    before and who gave every indication of not understanding it. Hermann Eilts has
                    ever forgiven me for having sent him to Libya on temporary duty as acting DCM in
                    an effort to help Lightner acquire an better appreciation of the Arab world. We
                    wanted him to stop haranguing the Libyan regime about the evils of Nasser, which
                    at the time, was totally profitless. We were more interested in holding on to
                    Wheelus Air Force base which was an anathema to Arab nationalists. Furthermore,
                    oil drilling in Libya was beginning to show great potential and American
                    companies were showing increasing interest in developing those oil fields. So
                    our relationships with Libya were becoming increasingly important.</p>

                <p>I should mention the Sudan which was well engaged in its historical North-South
                    split. That concerned us. Nimeiri came to power while I was the Director. We
                    supported him because in his first days, he was a very positive influence in
                    trying to heal the North-South breach. We tried to develop two major projects in
                    the Sudan: one was for a dam and the other was the Khartoum-Port Sudan road. We
                    ran into the same problems that still exist today. Sudan is a country with great
                    potential, but badly structured to take advantage of foreign assistance.
                    Assistance was a useful diplomatic tool for us in places like Ethiopia and
                    Tunisia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 15, 1995 (after almost a four year
                        interval) interview with Ambassador David Newsom.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Ambassador, I've been looking at the transcript of our previous session.
                    Before we pick up chronologically let me ask about something you mentioned at
                    that time. You said when you first came into the Foreign Service there was no
                    introduction in the Foreign Service Institute basic course to Harold Nicholson
                    or Satow, or anybody else who wrote on diplomacy. You only discovered the
                    classic literature later when taught at the Georgetown School of Foreign
                    Service. What would be the advantage of working and discussing the writings of
                    people on diplomacy for young diplomats?</p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I think two advantages. One, there is a great deal in Nicholson and other
                    classic writings on diplomacy about the art of negotiation and the art of
                    dealing with those from other governments that I think would quite properly be a
                    part of a Foreign Service officer's education. Secondly, I found that, in
                    dealing with European diplomats who were familiar with these works, I was
                    uninformed about the classic literature of diplomacy. So I think such study is
                    justified just from the standpoint of presenting American diplomats with an
                    education parallel to that of their counterparts. Those that have majored in
                    international relations in their university careers (which I did not do) may
                    have encountered these works, but I find even at the University of Virginia,
                    where there is a tradition of international relations courses, that very few of
                    them deal with the practice of diplomacy as defined by Satow and Nicholson and
                    others. So I think these books should be part of the young Foreign Service
                    officer's training either as a refresher or as an introduction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We left you before you were in North African affairs, and
                        we'd reached the point where you were appointed as Ambassador to Libya where
                        you served from '65 to '69. How did this appointment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I had completed four years in the Office of North African Affairs and was
                    familiar with the issues involving Libya. It seemed a logical assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This I take it was not a political plum. This was one that
                        was more or less going...we're talking about early in the Lyndon Johnson
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: No, I was very pleased to get the assignment. At that time it was a very
                    interesting one for an American ambassador. We still had the Wheelus airfield
                    there. It was a country where there was a growing American presence because of
                    the discovery of oil. So it was a good post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went there did you have, sort of in your hip
                        pocket, a list of things you wanted to accomplish, or problems you wanted to
                        try to work on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: As I recall there was some uncertainty at the time about where the Libyan
                    government stood on the duration of the agreement on Wheelus airbase. That was
                    one matter to be worked out. And secondly, I wanted to be sure that the embassy
                    was in tune with the growing American presence and whatever problems that might
                    involve the US officially as the result of that presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the oil.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Oil, yes. Both oil and the base issues became very active in the first
                    two years I was there. I don't recall the exact dates but a bitter dispute arose
                    between the major oil companies and the so-called independent oil companies. The
                    major companies, the so-called Seven Sisters, had interests throughout the
                    Middle East and had come into Libya. But the Libyans, unlike other oil producing
                    countries, had not given concessions only to the major companies, but had also
                    distributed concessions to a number of companies that were new to the area. And
                    when OPEC (The Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries) declared a new
                    policy on how royalties would be treated in tax calculations, it was a move that
                    was favorable to the majors, but not to the independents. There was a strong
                    move by the major companies to force the Libyan government to require the
                    independent companies to go along with this OPEC arrangement. It created a very
                    bitter division within the American private sector community, not something that
                    perhaps fell normally in the embassy's preview, but major American interests
                    were involved. So I became involved in that. Ultimately a compromise between
                    these two groups of companies was worked out in a session attended by their
                    respective lawyers in my residence in Libya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, you had Occidental as one of the leaders of
                        the independents — Armand Hammer and company.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: That's right. But the Oasis group of Marathon and one or two other
                    smaller companies was really more of a spearhead than Occidental. Armand Hammer
                    acted pretty well independently in Libya, benefitting from his access to the
                    King, and various other favors distributed in the Libyan political world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Libyan petroleum expertise? Because
                        at this time ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia was dominant but Arab countries were
                        beginning to challenge the power of the companies. They were beginning to
                        produce leaders who were knowledgeable in the field. But how about in Libya
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Ibrahim Moussa was minister of petroleum. He was supported by a pretty
                    sophisticated oil ministry. As a matter of fact, the whole Libyan approach to
                    the concession was, as I said before, a radical departure from the way the Gulf
                    countries had handled it. Libya divided up the country into squares and
                    determined that no company would have more than a certain proportion of the
                    total territory. Squares were put out to bids which opened up the Libyan oil
                    much more widely than had been the case of Saudi Arabia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any instructions from Washington on how
                        to handle these negotiations — to stay out of them, or to get into
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: If I learned one thing in Libya, it was that the fewer questions you
                    posed to Washington, the more chance you have of resolving problems. I had a
                    general idea of the limits of my maneuver. I also felt that there were some
                    unusual problems about which Washington would probably prefer not to be
                    bothered. I was introduced in Libya to the whole complex of dilemmas in the US
                    government's relationship with the private sector. The private sector, in
                    general, doesn't want the US government meddling in its business. And at that
                    time, unlike today, embassies were not encouraged to get into commercial
                    promotion to any great extent. But on the question of the oil company problem, I
                    don't recall they were getting any specific instructions. I worked on the basis
                    that when major US interests were involved, it was quite appropriate for the
                    ambassador to offer good offices, and neutral meeting places for the working out
                    of private sector problems. But the decisions would have to be theirs. Had I
                    been questioned about my role, I think I could have defended it on the basis of
                    the threat to the broader image of the United States in Libya, and in the Middle
                    East, of an open, unresolved battle between two groups of American
                    companies.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>The only time I got rapped on the knuckles was when Libya was in the market for
                    new aircraft, and the only salesman on the block at that point was from Boeing.
                    Boeing was in heavy competition with British Aircraft, which was getting strong
                    support from the British embassy. I met with the Boeing representative and told
                    him that his agent had the wrong political connections. He was not very
                    receptive at first, but as he did more investigating he found out that I was
                    right. And then I did make some quiet representations of behalf of Boeing — the
                    only US company with an active proposal. Boeing then wrote a letter to the
                    Department, and also, I guess, to the Department of Commerce, expressing
                    appreciation for the help of the American ambassador. That resulted in a
                    telegram saying that it was inappropriate to be representing one company without
                    encouraging other American companies to come in. But I survived that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an exciting period to be there. What were some of
                        the other developments that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: When I got there the government was agitating for, or at least there were
                    some in Libya that were agitating for the withdrawal of Wheelus airbase. It was
                    seen as a vestige of a past period. As Libyan oil brought more and more revenue,
                    the aid from the United States was less and less relevant and therefore Wheelus,
                    which was associated with aid as a quid pro quo, was less and less popular. So I
                    had to deal with that. I negotiated an agreement with the King which accepted
                    the “principle of withdrawal,” but without setting any date. At first Washington
                    didn't like this approach very much, but, ultimately, I think they understood
                    what I had done and why. The agreement finessed the issue of ultimate withdrawal
                    and reduced the pressure for immediate action.</p>
                <p>The most difficult period was during the 1967 war...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the six day war in June between
                        Israel, Egypt and Syria.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Right. Libya was not an active participant in the war but Libya is a
                    country that has very fierce feelings about its relationship with the rest of
                    the Arab world. Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt, was very popular in
                    Libya. There were a lot of Libyans who felt Libya should have joined in the war
                    in support of Egypt. There were actually some Libyans who tried to cross the
                    border into Egypt to fight, and, as I recall, the King stopped them. But when
                    the war broke out, you may recall, that was the so-called “big lie,” perpetrated
                    by Nasser and others, that the US had flown air cover for the Israelis when they
                    bombed Cairo. This was widely accepted in Libya. So not being quite sure of the
                    security of the American community, we evacuated all of the American dependents
                    and non-essential personnel, and shut down operations at Wheelus. And for about
                    two or three months after the war, Libya was in a traumatic state, and we had
                    nothing but the most basic contacts with Libyan officials and very little
                    contact with the rest of Libyan society.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>I will tell a story to illustrate the feeling at the time. The governor of the
                    Bank of Libya was an Italian-trained economist whom I had come to know. About
                    two months or so after the war I passed him on the street, greeted him and that
                    I'd like to come and visit him. He said, “No, I'll come to you,” and he fixed
                    the time. He came by and we sat in the garden. I'll always remember his saying
                    to me, “I know that this is a difficult time for you Americans, and I'm fairly
                    well convinced that the big lie is wrong.” “But,” he said, “you have to
                    understand that it's difficult for me and for most Libyans to accept the fact
                    that two million people, whom we always considered second class citizens, could
                    whip 80 million Arabs. So in my head, I know that you didn't help the Israelis,
                    but in my heart that's the only explanation that gives me satisfaction.” Well,
                    there we are, that's the Middle East.</p>
                <p>As another illustration, a newspaper publisher told me later that the power of
                    Nasser's message was such in Libya that when he took a ticker item out to his
                    composing room to be set in type saying that Nasser had accepted a cease-fire,
                    and, in effect, surrendered, his typesetters refused to set it in type. He had
                    to get a tape of Nasser's actually making that statement before they would put
                    into type.</p>
                <p>We did get Wheelus back in operation. That was also an adventure. The Air Force
                    in Washington didn't quite understand why we were so leery about Air Force
                    operations. One had to appreciate that Wheelus was right in the center of a
                    growing suburban area of Tripoli so that the aircraft taking off were a major
                    annoyance to the population that lived around the base, and there was no way to
                    disguise their operations. So after a couple of months I suggested that the head
                    of the 16th Air Force, a major general, come down and we work together to get
                    the base back into operation. We took two planes off one day to see if there was
                    any reaction, and four planes the next day, and we gradually got it back into
                    operation. The general told me later that he'd had a query from Air Force
                    Headquarters about why he was letting the ambassador run Air Force operations.
                    He said he waited until the base was back in normal operations, and then sent in
                    a brief message saying, “I didn't want to argue with success.”</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: The British had a base at Al Adam, which was over in eastern Libya near

                    time I was there. They still had troops in Cyrenaica, in the eastern part of the
                    country. And we were grateful that they did have because when the '67 war came
                    the most threatening demonstrations were in Benghazi. Our consulate staff was

                        evaluation at that time with him and his government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: King Idriss was a man who clearly did not want to be King, and did not
                    like Libya. Born in Algeria, he'd lived 40 years of his life in Cairo. His
                    personal entourage consisted of Palestinians and Italians. As far as I could
                    observe, he had no Libyans in his immediate service. He would really only take
                    an interest in governing the country when there was a crisis and he was forced
                    to make some decisions. I guess he fairly shrewdly manipulated the political
                    elite of the time to put together governments that had some possibility of
                    effective support, but he was not popular. The revolution in '69, I think, came
                    about as much because of a vacuum of power as it was an excess of power.The King
                    had been out of the country, in Turkey, for some time before the revolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the government — the foreign ministry and
                        all — that you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: There were some excellent people among the Libyan ministers, and there
                    were some that were difficult. There was an undercurrent of xenophobia in Libya,
                    an undercurrent of what we would today call Islamic, maybe not militancy, but at
                    least a strong Islamic strain. One has to remember that countries have been
                    fighting their wars across Libyan territory since the days of the Roman Empire
                    and through World War II. So there's a long history of hatred of foreigners who
                    have crossed and criss-crossed Libyan territory. Qadhafi came to power after I
                    left, but some of his ideas that seem somewhat strange to the outsider are not
                    strange to someone who understood these kinds of tendencies in the Libyan
                    society.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>So when you were dealing with the Libyan government, you needed to be conscious
                    of these sensitivities, and to some extent of the vulnerabilities of those who
                    chose to work in the King's government because they encountered criticism, if
                    not outright hostility, on the part of some of their fellow countrymen. There
                    was one Libyan Prime Minister there much of the time that I was there, by the
                    name Hussein Mazziq, who was the most impenetrable of the officials I dealt
                    with. He had a technique I had never encountered then or since. If you asked him
                    a question he didn't want to answer, he just sat there, mute, and left you to
                    pick up the conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the embassy staff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I had a good staff. It was not a large staff. With one exception, they
                    worked well during the crisis period of '67. We had a couple of excellent
                    Arabists. I look back on the staff very favorably, including the Agency
                    personnel with whom I worked closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Including the CIA, yes.</p>
                <p>We had a small office up in Baida, which was the alternate capital, a small town
                    up in the hills of Cyrenaica, where the King liked to spend more time than in
                    Tripoli. During the '67 war, there was an officer, who shall remain nameless,
                    who sent word that he felt uncomfortable in the current atmosphere, and
                    announced that he was closing the office and leaving for Benghazi. So in the
                    middle of the crisis I had to fly up in an air force jet, landing in a very
                    small airfield, to put another officer up there because Baida was a critical
                    post at that point. But, other than that incident, the staff was very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the CIA, or the military attach�s were giving
                        you any forebodings of the Qadhafi coup. Or were you waiting for a shoe to
                        drop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The agency had reports of a group that was forming, called the Black
                    Boots, probably a group that was centered around an officer by the name of Abdul
                    Aziz Shalhi. But that group, if they had any intention of trying to seize power,
                    was preempted by the Qadhafi group on which we had no information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the situation in Algeria spill over into Libya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: No, Algeria got its independence in '62. There were no events there as I
                    remember that had an impact on Libya.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>One other problem that I should mention in connection with Libya was the problem
                    of corruption. Either the existence of corruption, or the belief in corruption,
                    has been a factor in most of the Middle Eastern revolutions that I have
                    observed. One of the almost Shakespearean parts of the Libyan scene was the
                    position held by a family named Shalhi. Those of the family who were there when
                    I was there were children to Ibrahim Shalhi. Ibrahim Shalhi had been assigned as
                    a companion to Idriss when Idriss was nine and Shalhi was eleven. Idriss was the
                    successor to the leadership of a movement called the Senousi movement, a
                    religious movement that extended throughout North Africa. These two men grew up
                    together. Ibrahim Shalhi was assassinated very shortly after Libyan
                    independence. The king, who had no living issue of his own, adopted the Shalhi
                    family. There were two members of that family to whom the King gave virtual
                    carte blanche to profiteer from the awarding of the oil concessions. I grew used
                    to complaints from Libyan ministers that their decisions were sometimes
                    overridden by the influence of the Shalhi family. How much a contributing factor
                    this was to the undermining of the King, I don't know, but it certainly was a
                    factor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the technicalities of how diplomacy is done. You see a
                        bad corruption problem. How does one report this? Just a report may leak in
                        the US, setting off all sorts of reactions that are detrimental to other
                        policies. How do you as ambassador see this problem? How do you deal with
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Well, as I remember, we reported the reports of corruption. We couldn't
                    name names, particularly names of Americans who might have been involved because
                    we didn't have the evidence, and embassies have no statutory responsibility,
                    even under the Corrupt Practices Act, to investigate allegations of corruption.
                    But because rumors of corruption were a political fact, this was quite
                    legitimate to report. I took it upon myself on a couple of occasions in talking
                    to the King, to raise questions about the reports of the activities of the
                    Shalhi family. But it was very clear that this was a subject that the old king
                    did not want to discuss. A kind of mask would come over his face and that was
                    it. Indirectly, the Libyan experience led to the enactment of the Corrupt
                    Practices Act.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about USCPA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes, the US Corrupt Practices Act. After I returned from Libya and was
                    appointed assistant secretary for African affairs, I was called up to a
                    congressional hearing on charges laid against the Occidental Petroleum Company
                    by a disgruntled accountant. A staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee had encountered this man and gained from him a lot of details about
                    payoffs. I remember being asked by Senators at the time, “Did you know about
                    this?” I remember telling them I had heard rumors, but this was not a matter in
                    which the US government had any role or authority. This was a matter between the
                    US companies and the Libyans, and, therefore, I had no basis for inquiring into
                    this. A couple of the Senators were quite taken aback by that, and I think this
                    led to an enactment of legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, as you say, Nasser was a major
                        figure in Libya. And here you have this King — was it the feeling that
                        Nasser or his agents were trying to overthrow the King? How were things
                        going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: There was no doubt about Nasser's popularity as I mentioned in the
                    context of the '67 war. There may have been Egyptian activities. I don't recall
                    any direct attacks by Nasser on Libya although I'm sure there were undercurrents
                    that emanated from Egypt against Wheelus and against the American presence. But
                    the Libyan elite with whom I was dealing mostly were at least, even after '67,
                    somewhat contemptuous of Nasser, and loved to tell Nasser jokes that they'd
                    picked up in Cairo. There was no doubt but what, under the surface, Nasser's
                    brand of Arab nationalism was making great headway. I might add that after the
                    King was overthrown, Nasser, very shrewdly, gave Idriss asylum in Cairo and
                    provided him with one of Farouk's old palaces. I think Nasser, not being quite
                    sure about Qadhafi, felt that he would have a card to play.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: I wrote an airgram after going around and meeting with a number of
                    prominent Libyans and said basically, I can't predict how things are going to
                    turn out in this country, but there is definitely a malaise that could lead to
                    major political developments. We shouldn't be surprised if such developments
                    take place — something along that line.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I thought it was a good job and I was very pleased to be chosen. It was
                    one of the best jobs I ever had, in part because nobody in the Nixon
                    administration was terribly interested in Africa and I had a considerable amount
                    of leeway. I got back and was plunged right into two major issues. One was the
                    drafting of a new policy paper on Southern Africa, a famous National Security
                    decision memorandum, NSSM 39. There was a tug of war between the African Bureau
                    and the National Security Council staff over a paper that many in the Department
                    felt tilted too much to a favorable attitude towards South Africa. I incurred
                    the wrath of the NSC staff because I took the whole thing home one weekend and
                    rewrote it to what I considered a more balanced approach. It didn't go through
                    quite that way but it was better than when we started.</p>
                <p>The other major problem was the Nigerian civil war over Biafra.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if we can go back to the South African problem.
                        We're really talking about the beginning of putting South Africa into a
                        certain amount of isolation throughout the world because of its apartheid
                        policy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: No, we're talking about the reversal of that, or attempts to reverse it.
                    The Kennedy administration came in with a strong interest in Africa at the same
                    time that the Black Caucus began to develop and African-American organizations
                    began to take an interest in the apartheid situation. A major thrust toward
                    greater isolation of South Africa, establishing an arms embargo, stopping naval
                    visits, and curtailing export credits began under Kennedy. When the Nixon
                    administration came in with its more conservative supporters, there was an
                    effort to reverse that, but it was an effort that was not totally successful.
                    There was some lifting of limits on dual purpose items for the South African
                    military, such as executive jet aircraft. I guess some liberalization of export
                    credits took place, but the Nixon administration discovered that there were
                    limitations they hadn't fully realized. At one point, for example, they wanted
                    to send an aircraft carrier into Simonstown, the South African naval base, for
                    refueling. When we pointed out to them that the black and white sailors were
                    going to be separated as they got off the ship, that gave them pause. They
                    figured in the Nixon administration that they'd gotten only 8% of the black
                    vote, and they didn't have to pay too much attention to black attitudes, but
                    there were a lot of white American attitudes that were opposed to apartheid that
                    they had to take into consideration.</p>

                    Defense Department had the thought that the United States should try to promote
                    an alliance between Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, and they had reached Henry
                    Kissinger on this. I had to go and explain to Henry Kissinger the history of the
                    antagonism of Christian Ethiopia for Muslim Saudi Arabia and I didn't think that
                    this was something that we should be promoting. He accepted that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: September 1, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we initially see the Qadhafi movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I left Libya at the end of June. It was a couple of weeks after the coup
                    before we really had some understanding of its nature. Qadhafi initially didn't
                    appear as the leader. There were some moderate Libyans that we had known. One
                    was a lawyer for one of the oil companies. So initially we thought that maybe
                    this was something we could work with. But then Qadhafi gradually emerged as
                    leader. Joe Palmer, who had been my predecessor as the Assistant Secretary for
                    Africa, went out as ambassador. We had at least assumed that we could establish
                    a normal relationship. But then gradually it became clear that Khady was in
                    charge with his xenophobic view of the world and his demands that Wheelus leave.
                    Relationships became more and more strained. There were increasing demands. Our
                    information office was sacked, as I remember, and, after I left for a new
                    assignment in the mid ''70s, we ultimately, I guess, suspended all
                    relationships.</p>
                <p>I got back into the picture just after I came in as Under Secretary in '78 when
                    Mansour Kikhya, the Libyan diplomat who recently disappeared while in Cairo,
                    whom I had known, before came to me to suggest that possibly relations could be
                    improved. Kikhya, at that time, was Libya's UN representative. This was right at
                    the time that Billy Carter, Jimmy Carter's brother, had gotten into some
                    prominence by working on some contract in Libya. Carter had, contrary to our
                    advice, received the head of the Libyan People's Bureau in Washington, the
                    equivalent of their embassy. He hoped to try to straighten out his brother's
                    problems through the People's Bureau channel. But on that basis we felt that
                    senior American officials should also see Qadhafi. So I was sent out to Libya
                    some time in mid '78. But just before I went out Senator Jacob Javits introduced
                    a measure in the Senate banning all commercial aircraft sales to Libya. When I
                    got there the doors closed unless I could get that ban lifted, which wasn't
                    possible. So that was my last immersion in Libyan problems.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes, he did. He was very supportive of me. He supported the bureau when
                    we insisted that our consulate in Salisbury, Rhodesia, be closed after Ian Smith
                    had made his unilateral declaration of independence. He was the first Secretary
                    of State to tour Africa. I went with him on that journey. But he had his own

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: You couldn't escape an awareness of that. In spite of what I sensed then
                    and have known since to have been his intense frustrations with his old friend
                    Nixon, and with Kissinger, Rogers himself, who is a very honorable citizen,
                    never gave a hint to any of us of those frustrations. Sometimes you could sense
                    it. We had a weekly lunch with the Secretary which was great. But I remember,
                    for example, once standing by his desk when he wanted to talk to the President
                    about something. He picked up the phone to call the President and I guess he got
                    Bob Haldeman, and Haldeman must have told Rogers that the President was not
                    available or something. He slammed the phone down. You could sense his
                    frustration.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: It was just in its beginning stages, and I would really have to go back
                    and look at the chronology. One problem in that region was the problem of
                    managing the admission of Mauritania to the UN, something that had been opposed
                    by the Moroccans. A compromise was ultimately worked out to admit both
                    Mauritania and Mongolia to satisfy both sides of the Cold War divide. The
                    Polisario problem was complicated for us because Mauritania supported the
                    Polisario but we needed to maintain good relations with Morocco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning now to Biafra. When you arrived there was the
                        civil war going in Nigeria at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: The civil war had been going on, I guess, for about a year. The big issue
                    was whether the United States would support the movement of relief supplies into
                    Biafra without the consent of the military government in Lagos. The Biafran
                    issue became an American domestic political issue. Peace Corps volunteers who
                    had served in eastern Nigeria organized, primarily in Massachusetts, a group
                    that was pro-Biafran. They were joined by a network of Catholic fathers who
                    worked in Biafra. One of these fathers ran a communications network for Ojukwu,
                    the Biafran leader. The Both the Peace Corps volunteers and the Holy Ghost
                    fathers reached Senator Edward Kennedy, who was then the head of the Senate
                    Judiciary Committee. Their efforts were combined with a very effective lobby run
                    out of Geneva by an outfit called Mark Press. In addition, a group of very
                    effective Ibos who had been working in American universities mounted a newspaper
                    advertising campaign, for example, with a picture of a child with a bloated
                    belly resulting from kwashiorkor, a malnutrition disease. Subsequently we
                    learned that it wasn't a picture of a Biafran child at all.</p>
                <p>I came into the foreign service from the San Francisco area. When I returned to
                    Washington from Libya to take up my assignment as assistant secretary for
                    Africa, someone sent me a full page ad in the San Francisco Examiner addressed
                    to David Newsom, new Assistant Secretary of African Affairs, with the picture of
                    the kwashiorkor child. The ad read: “If you want to save this child write to
                    Assistant Secretary David Newsom.” So I arrived in the Department with a great
                    stack of mostly hate mail.</p>
                <p>Senator Kennedy held a series of hearings on trying to get aid into Biafra. The
                    issue was whether aid could go in on night flights unmonitored by the Nigerians.
                    The Nigerians were afraid, probably with some justification, that they would be
                    carrying arms as well as food. There was also pressure for the US to recognize
                    Biafra as an independent country. Nixon, himself, I think, toyed with that idea
                    at one time. Biafra, as with the case of the earlier separatism of Katanga in
                    Congo, (Zaire), was seen by many as a blow against the development of major
                    black African countries. So, to the black community in the United States, Biafra
                    became a symbol of those who were trying to break up the largest black nation in
                    the world. The African bureau was caught between these attitudes. The attitude
                    in the White House was one really against the federal military government in
                    Lagos. The attitude in the black community and the liberal white community was
                    one that supported Lagos. So. until the war ended, we were caught in this
                    constant and sometimes highly emotional battle. The NSC had two people, Roger
                    Morris and Dick Kennedy, who were strong supporters of aid to Biafra. And at one
                    time they were so unhappy with some of the reporting of the embassy in Lagos
                    that they went out themselves to try and put the embassy straight on what they
                    considered to be American policy. So it was a major bureaucratic and
                    diplomatic...</p>

                    and to hold the line against any recognition of Biafra. The end of the war

                <p>NEWSOM: The embassy in Lagos was primarily emphasizing the importance to the
                    United States of maintaining a good relationship with Nigeria. It was trying to
                    report what it knew about the situation in Biafra. One element in it was the big
                    debate over a report, the so-called Weston report, on nutrition in Biafra that
                    was made by the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta about late '69 or early
                    '70. As I remember, it put things in a somewhat less alarmist projection than
                    some of the propaganda on behalf of Biafra. But then the real crunch came after
                    the war ended in January of 1970-71. I was sent out to Lagos to urge General
                    Gowon, the Nigerian leader, to accept an international commission to oversee the
                    post-war treatment of Biafra. My mission was not helped by the fact that the
                    morning I was to see General Gowon, I was having breakfast with my British
                    counterpart, Maurice Foley, and we were listening to the BBC. The BBC announced
                    that representatives of the United States and Britain “will today see General
                    Gowon and press him to accept an international commission to oversee the
                    reincorporation of Biafra.” The last thing either one of us needed at that time
                    was a signal to Gowon on what we were going to raise. When I went to see Gowon,
                    an impressive man, I presented my requests to him. He turned around in his chair
                    and he waved at a bookcase behind his desk where there was a full set of Bruce
                    Catton's history of the American civil war. He said, “I have read about your
                    war, and I can tell you, and you can tell Washington, that our treatment of
                    Biafra will be much more humane than the North's treatment of the South.” And,
                    actually, it was. This was the first time that I had met General Obasanjo, who
                    later became president of Nigeria, and then was subsequently arrested by the
                    present Nigerian government. He was a brigadier in the Nigerian army, assigned
                    to work on the rehabilitation of the eastern provinces, together with a man
                    named Mohammed who was the head of the Nigerian Red Cross. They really did a
                    remarkable job of reincorporating peacefully eastern Nigeria into the rest of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>About a year and a half later, John Reinhardt, who was the then ambassador to
                    Nigeria, and I, toured eastern Nigeria. This was only a year and a half or so
                    after the war, and we were both struck by how much normality had returned, and
                    how many of the Ibos had gone back. They had the attitude, well, we tried and we
                    lost, but life has to go on. So it was not the blood bath that people...</p>

                    on Mobutu that might have resulted in a breakup of Zaire. Mobutu was

                    supporting the UN sanctions against Rhodesia. There was a lot of opposition, and
                    Senator Byrd and friends of Rhodesia came up with this idea that because of the
                    sanctions we were now dependent upon the Soviet Union for vital materials,

                <p>NEWSOM: I think there was beginning to emerge in the United States a feeling that
                    the Soviets were having their problems in Africa. That was apart from those who
                    tried to picture the Southern African struggle as essentially a struggle between
                    the West and both Soviet and Chinese communism. I don't think that we felt the
                    threat was too great but the only way you could get aid from Congress for some
                    parts of Africa was to stress the Soviet threat. So you'll find a constant
                    repetition of references to it in documents and statements presented to the
                    Congress.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: I came into office just after the Senate had passed a law limiting
                    bilateral aid programs to ten countries in Africa. So my task was to go around
                    Africa with a ladle and a bucket of water to pour cold water on expectations
                    that had been raised by the rhetoric and the actions of the ''60s. For much of
                    the African continent we were left with no aid instruments other than a $50,000
                    self-help fund. There was a lot of disillusionment in Congress about some of the
                    major aid programs that we had had, including long-term commitments to Nigeria
                    and Ghana and Kenya that had been slow in implementation. So we had an up-hill
                    battle to secure aid for African countries unless we could demonstrate that
                    there was a collateral interest such as the communication station we had in
                    Ethiopia, Cagnew station, and obligations to strategically placed countries like
                    Kenya and Zaire. We did manage to continue aid programs to ten countries, but
                    these were not terribly popular programs with a lot of people on the Hill.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: I was very high on the Peace Corps, particularly after we had to cut back
                    on regular aid programs. The Peace Corps represented our only presence in many
                    countries. The Peace Corps was effective when there were individual volunteers
                    out in rural areas. The Peace Corps was a disaster when there was a group
                    congregated in capitals. When Secretary Rogers made his trip in 1970 through
                    Africa, the two problems we had with the Peace Corps were in Tunis and Addis
                    Ababa where Peace Corps volunteers were, in effect, demonstrating against
                    American policy in Vietnam, and were very hostile to the Secretary. This
                    congregation of young Americans out of the ''60s generation in an African
                    capital feeding each other's Vietnam frenzies was an unhealthy mix.</p>

                    go somewhere overseas. And I said I thought four years was enough as Assistant
                    Secretary, and I would be interested in an overseas post. And he said, what

                <p>NEWSOM: In a sense sub-Saharan Africa was a diversion from the areas that I had
                    been active in before. I had been active largely in Muslim countries, Pakistan,
                    Iraq, Libya, desk officer for the Arabian Peninsula, and I thought it would be
                    interesting to go to the other extremity of the Muslim world, the largest Muslim
                    country. I tried to learn as much as I could about Indonesia. I'd been there as

                    unfamiliar with it.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Yes. What I encountered was a feeling on the part of the East Asian hands
                    — skeptical that anyone who had not been immersed in East Asia could understand
                    Indonesia? I have had a general philosophy that, although certainly countries
                    are very different, there are certain approaches you can take to understanding
                    the power structure in a country, understanding where decisions are made, and by
                    whom. This an essential element of a diplomat's task, and I found some very
                    interesting material about the power structure in Indonesia, particularly after
                    the 1965 abortive coup in Indonesia. It was in many ways one of the most
                    interesting assignments that I had.</p>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: The United States had a very good relationship with Indonesia. We had a
                    substantial aid program, both economic and military. Another thing that was not
                    unfamiliar to me was that Indonesia was an oil producing country and I had been
                    associated with several oil producing countries. I wanted obviously to maintain
                    the momentum of the relationship and to understand as much of the politics as I
                    could. As I prepared for the position, in Washington pressures grew on the human
                    rights question. Legislation passed in the Congress about the time I went out to
                    Indonesia required that human rights considerations be taken into account in aid
                    programs. It was clear that something had to be done about the perceptions of
                    the human rights situation in Indonesia. That became one of my principal tasks.
                    When I went out there, there were still about 30,000 people held in detention
                    following the abortive coup in 1965, many of them on an island called Buru. They
                    were charged with being members of communist organizations. The Suharto regime,
                    then and now in power, blamed the 1965 events on the communists, particularly
                    the Chinese communists. These people had never been formally charged with
                    anything, and Amnesty International and others had picked up their cause. In
                    1975, there was a threat of some very specific legislation in the Congress that
                    would have cut off military assistance to Indonesia if something weren't done
                    about these detainee. I had developed a good relationship with a man who was
                    then the head of Army intelligence, General Benny Murdani, and I went to him for
                    advice. I pointed out that there was a move in the Congress to enact
                    country-specific legislation directed at Indonesia which would obviously create
                    problems. Should I go to President Suharto and explain this, and explain why, I
                    asked. General Murdani said, “No, don't do that. He will only see that as a
                    threat. Let me think about it.” Murdani came back in about a week and suggested
                    that he and another man, Ali Murtopo, who was then head of the Army-backed
                    political party, visit Washington to talk with the members of Congress about the
                    situation in Indonesia. If they found that the situation was as I described it,
                    they could then tell President Suharto and he would not see it as a threat
                    coming from me. And this is what they did. The President made the decision to
                    release these people. The first effort at release was not a great success
                    because they invited the diplomats of the countries that had been pressing them
                    on the issue to a ceremony in an army barracks in Sumatra. They brought in about
                    300 detainee, off-loaded them from army trucks, had them come in and swear an
                    oath of allegiance to the nation's philosophy, and then put them back on trucks
                    and drove them away. So I went to Benny Murdani and said, “You know, this isn't
                    going to work. You've got to release them, let them mingle with their family,
                    with the press, with the diplomats.” Well, they got the picture and over the
                    time I was there all but about 180 detainees who were considered to be the ring
                    leaders of the communist effort were released.</p>

                        to put it in a pejorative term, but this was where his interests lay and he
                        felt this was a sideshow. In the first place, when you say Congress, it
                        usually means there are a couple of people in Congress who are willing to
                        make a fuss about this, and where did this come from?</hi>

                <p>NEWSOM: It came from Donald Fraser, a Congressman from Minnesota, who was the
                    chairman of a subcommittee on international organizations with the House Foreign
                    Affairs Committee. He and a small staff, unhappy with Kissinger's attitude,
                    unhappy with what they saw as the US identification with a lot of military
                    regimes in Latin America, began introducing legislation. I think, all in all,
                    there were eleven different pieces of legislation that tied human rights to a
                    variety of US government actions. This is important because everybody thinks
                    that human rights started with Jimmy Carter's administration, and it didn't.
                    Jimmy Carter brought some of the staff people that had worked with Donald Fraser
                    into the State Department Bureau of Humanitarian Affairs, and much of the
                    momentum was maintained. But the real impetus was in the Congress.</p>

                        North Korea is only 30 miles away. When this first came up you were really
                        at the leading edge in a country where it was really important. How did you
                        find that the State Department and the Foreign Service responded to this
                        legislation at the very beginning?</hi>

                <p>NEWSOM: As I recall, this was now in the Ford administration and Kissinger was
                    Secretary of State, I think there was an effort to head it off but then that
                    didn't work. So they had to adapt to it. I don't recall ever having received a
                    formal instruction on this. In most of my career I acted on what I felt needed
                    to be done and minimized the need to send me instructions. This was obviously
                    something that needed to be done, and I had a lot of help. The Dutch ambassador
                    was also getting pressures from the Netherlands. The Papal Nuncio was very
                    important. The British ambassador, and to some extent, the Australian, worked
                    with us and together we concluded that the possibility was there of making some
                    progress.</p>

                        their own, you had almost to control them. At least this is my experience in
                        other places. Because they saw everything as youth will, in one color, one
                        focus. Obviously we had a lot of other things going in Indonesia rather than
                        just human rights. Was this a problem within the embassy?</hi>

                    anybody. I was taking the lead on it because I felt it was something that needed

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>I did something in Indonesia which was very interesting, speaking of the younger
                    officers. I always found it important, but at the same time difficult as
                    ambassador, to get the views of younger officers who often had different
                    contacts, different perspectives. If you called in all the junior officers and
                    asked them what they thought, you could sometimes get a dialogue going, but
                    sometimes not. So I had a series of seminars during which I asked junior
                    officers on a panel of four to present an issue as they saw it in Indonesia. I
                    tried to get all of the agency heads to realize this was an academic exercise
                    just within the embassy and I wanted these officers to speak their minds, tell
                    me how they saw things. That worked very well with every agency but USIA. USIA
                    officers all felt they had to spout the official line. One young Military
                    Assistance Group officer got into difficulty with his chief because he was very
                    candid, and I think quite accurate, about some of the problems with the Military
                    Assistance program. I found that exercise useful.</p>

                        love because the language is manageable. Indonesians are an interesting
                        people, it's an interesting culture and it's a big country. Did you find
                        this gave you more contacts, and more information flowing in than you might

                    some extent Africa where I had spent much of my time. The Indonesians did not
                    lay all their problems at our door. The Indonesians, somewhat like the Chinese,
                    have a very strong sense of their own identity. You can talk to them about
                    sensitive subjects without having them erupt in rhetoric of one kind and
                    another. They are interesting and generally pleasant people to deal with. They,
                    like many people in the Asian world, often deal indirectly and you have to learn
                    that. You have to build contacts so that when you go in to solve a problem you
                    can find out what the problem is that you're trying to solve.</p>

                <p>One example. We had a large American community there, about three or four
                    thousand working in oil fields. Indonesia was just beginning the oil boom phase,
                    and there were a lot of people in collateral businesses. We had a very good
                    international school. It had been created on the basis of the foreign
                    technicians that were working there at the time, so it had the curious board of
                    sponsorship of four embassies, the American, Australians, Canadian and Yugoslav
                    embassies. It was a school for both diplomatic and non-diplomatic children. One
                    day I got wind of the fact that the Indonesian government was about to issue a
                    decree that would forbid non-diplomatic children from attending this school.
                    Non-diplomatic children were the bulk of the students. It would have meant a
                    serious change in the school. I tried to find out why this issue, this decree,
                    was being issued. I had no success in approaching the matter frontally. One
                    night at a dinner I saw a retired foreign minister, a man who had been
                    ambassador in Washington whom I knew well, and I explained the situation and
                    told him I was puzzled: “If I knew what the problem was maybe I could do
                    something about this.” He answered, “It's the Chinese.” I said, “what do you
                    mean it's the Chinese?” Although the government didn't do it at that time, it
                    had been considering opening relations with the People's Republic, and it did
                    not want a precedent that would permit ethnic Chinese in Indonesia to attend
                    Chinese schools. I was able to go to the appropriate minister and propose that
                    there be a grandfather clause for all schools developed after this date that new
                    rules would apply. That solved that problem.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Oh, yes. There was a group of American educated technocrats, called the
                    Berkeley Mafia because many of them had been to the University of California at
                    Berkeley, who did an amazing job of bringing the economy out of the sad state
                    that Sukarno had left it in. They were a very competent group. The most dramatic
                    evidence of this was related to the financial problems of the Indonesian
                    National Oil Company, called Pertamina. Pertamina had been developed under the
                    enthusiastic leadership of a friend of President Suharto by the name of Ibnu
                    Sutowo. Ibnu Sutowo had really built up an empire within an empire around
                    Pertamina. This was a time in the mid-''70s when American banks, as well as
                    European banks, were flooded with Euro dollars, and they were trying to get rid
                    of them by lending them to what they thought were oil rich countries. The
                    bankers used to flow through Indonesia. I used to tell them, “I hope you're
                    taking a good look at this country because its got 10% of OPEC's production, and
                    80% of OPEC's population. It's not Saudi Arabia.” But as one banker once said to
                    me, “everybody else is lending them money, we should lend money too.” One day a
                    representative of a small bank in Dallas came in to see me. He'd been in to see
                    the economic counselor and had said his bank was a part of a syndicate of banks
                    that had made a big loan to Indonesia. Indonesia had just defaulted on the
                    interest payment and his bank was going to call the loan; that is, they were
                    going to require that Indonesia repay the whole thing. This could have created a
                    serious crisis of confidence. I got in touch with this man and asked that he
                    give me 48 hours to see if I could resolve the problem without his calling the
                    loan. He agreed. I got hold of one of the technocrats and explained the
                    situation. One of the things that had happened was that these banks had been
                    lending money to Indonesia on the assumption that the Indonesian government
                    stood behind the loans to Pertamina. They didn't. But the Indonesian official
                    recognized the significance of this development and within the 48 hours got the
                    Indonesian government to stand behind this loan. That triggered a revelation
                    that Pertamina was some three billion dollars in debt. And Widjojo, who was the
                    leader of the technocrats, went to President Suharto. This was quite remarkable
                    given the fact that a non-military technocrat was going to President Suharto and
                    to tell him that the enterprise of Suharto's close friend, Sutowo, was in deep
                    financial difficulty. He did that and to Suharto's great credit, he accepted
                    that fact. He pushed Ibnu Sutowo aside, put another very capable army officer in
                    charge and named a committee to unravel the debt problem. Indonesia saved its
                    credit status and worked its way out of what could have been a serious problem.
                    But the point is that these very competent and alert technocrats had both the
                    courage and the prestige to get the President to dismantle a very fragile
                    commercial empire.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Suharto is a Javanese with strong beliefs in mysticism and the syncrectic
                    religious foundation of Indonesia — a combination of Islam with Hindu, Buddhist,
                    Confucian influences. He is reported periodically to consult a Javanese seer, or
                    dukun. He lacks charisma and is a somewhat private man. I haven't seen him now
                    for many, many years, but when I knew him he was never totally comfortable with
                    foreigners. This was partly a language problem. He had a kind of set routine
                    when he was meeting visitors and would launch into a long monologue on “national
                    resilience (katehanan national) I used to suggest to visitors who had some topic
                    to discuss with the president that, after his greeting, they state immediately
                    their reason for being there. If a visitor did not do that immediately, any
                    hopes of a useful exchange were dashed. He was intelligent, shrewd, and
                    certainly led Indonesia out of a difficult period. He had the good sense to rely
                    on a lot of talent that was around him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: My general conclusion was that if an American company came in with a
                    unique product, or unique technology, and came in first to deal with the
                    technocrats — the officials ostensibly in charge of the economy — they should
                    come in without any side payments or attempts to incorporate Suharto's relatives
                    into their corporate structure. If they were coming in with a product that was
                    in competition with a local product, then playing by our rules was much more
                    difficult. But not impossible. One of the problems was that some American
                    companies concluded that they had to make some special arrangements before they
                    ever went to Indonesia. They came through Hong Kong and they'd be approached by
                    somebody in Hong Kong who said that they were the third cousin of the president,
                    and the only way they could get business there was by taking them on board. Some
                    American companies got badly taken by people like that. I always urged them not
                    to make any side deals. Come first to Jakarta and see the people who are
                    ostensibly in charge; they might succeed. If they were in competition with a
                    local firm, or someone else who got there first, they might be approached, and
                    that's their problem. I told them I did not encourage any special arrangements,
                    but I did encourage business executives to try to come in without them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Indonesians at the time that I was there were members of the
                    International Control Commission, ICC, along with the Poles, the Canadians, and
                    Iranians. They had a very different view of how the war was doing than we did.
                    Although Sukarno was overthrown, his policy of neutrality, non-alignment,
                    remained. I've forgotten now whether Indonesia had formal diplomatic relations
                    with Vietnam, but they were in touch with Hanoi all through the war. The most
                    dramatic evidence of the Indonesian attitude was clear when Graham Martin came
                    to Indonesia. He was US ambassador in Vietnam at the time. He came to Indonesia
                    in January of 1975, and talked to the Indonesians about how “we really don't
                    have any problems in Vietnam, it's all the little old ladies in tennis shoes
                    that are stirring up all this.” And afterwards one of the Indonesians in their
                    quiet way said to me that they were very much interested in hearing Ambassador
                    Martin, but he “must be in a different country than we are.” There were
                    Indonesians that would say they were grateful that the US was there because
                    Indonesia could have been next. But that was relatively rare. The Indonesians
                    were proud of the fact that they had themselves blocked a communist take-over,
                    and they didn't want to perpetuate the idea that it was the United States or

                    military officers. That, combined with their general suspicion of the three
                    million Chinese in Indonesia whose citizenship allegiances they questioned, led
                    them to strongly oppose normalizing with China. They feared the influence of a
                    Chinese diplomatic mission on their own Chinese. It was a domestic Indonesian
                    matter, and didn't reflect a general opposition to the Chinese leadership. They
                    had a lot of dealings with China through Hong Kong, but they also had some
                    dealings with Taiwan. But the feeling against a Chinese official presence in

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: The Portuguese revolution took place in 1974. I think Suharto genuinely
                    tried to negotiate something with the Portuguese for a year at least, but he
                    couldn't find any interlocutors from Lisbon who really could make a decision. It
                    is my impression that he restrained the military from going in for quite a
                    while. To understand the Timor question you get back to the Chinese. The
                    Indonesian military were convinced that the independence movement on Timor was
                    Chinese backed, and they were not about to permit one-half of one of their
                    islands to be an independent entity backed by the Chinese. They didn't handle it
                    very well, but I don't think there was ever any doubt that that Indonesian
                    government, and maybe any Indonesian government, would oppose an independence in
                    one-half of an Indonesian island.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: The Japanese were very active. I arrived there just after the riots of
                    January 1974 when Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka had visited Indonesia and there
                    had been riots against his visit. The attitude toward the Japanese was a
                    somewhat ambivalent one. The Indonesians were grateful to the Japanese for
                    creating the atmosphere in which their independence movement grew during the
                    war. They shared the view of other Asians about Japanese brutality, but they
                    were prepared to do business with the Japanese. Suharto had had a Japanese
                    military instructor during the war, during the Japanese occupation. He used to
                    invite him back annually for a visit. As I say, it was complicated.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: We worked hard to promote American interests there. The biggest
                    competition was in major infrastructure projects. The Japanese had the advantage
                    of a little less rigidity as far as special arrangements were concerned. But
                    they also were highly competitive in terms of tying aid packages into commercial
                    deals. But American business did reasonably well while we were there. One of the
                    big contracts was for the first Indonesian satellite, which went to an American
                    company. This really established modern communications among all the
                    islands.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I left there in '77. My association with the boat people problem was
                    after I returned to Washington and was Under Secretary and involved in the
                    coordination of refugee assistance. I had only a little bit in my brief time in

                <p>NEWSOM: No. The Indonesians never accepted the Peace Corps. They had a kind of
                    youth corps of their own. I think there was a Peace Corps at one time, but
                    Sukarno threw it out. The Suharto government was always very careful not to go
                    too far from the non-aligned path on policies that had been established by
                    Sukarno. On economic policies they were prepared to make major changes, but
                    where there was a political aspect to it, they were more reluctant.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Yes, there was a consultative group on Indonesia, originally chaired by
                    the Dutch, and that's the way it was for most of the time that I was there.
                    Later the Indonesians got mad at the Dutch, if I remember, over the Dutch
                    reaction to East Timor. But the Intergovernmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) was
                    a very effective mechanism for the coordination of international relief. The
                    general aid picture in Indonesia while I was there was a positive one.
                    International coordination was reasonably good. Our program over the years had
                    considerable impact, primarily in the training of people for positions in both
                    government and the private sector.</p>

                    who had come from Indonesia to the United States over the life of the aid

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: When Suharto came in, he took advantage of a relatively small group of
                    mostly American educated Indonesians. Many of them who had gone to the
                    University of California at Berkeley came to be known as the Berkeley Mafia.
                    They were instrumental in turning around Indonesia's economy after the Sukarno
                    period, and they were very positive about sending people abroad for education
                    because they had benefitted from it themselves. One of the remarkable things
                    about Indonesia, at least when I was there, is that the Indonesians that were
                    sent abroad came home. A very large number of them went into the jobs for which
                    they were trained, unlike some other countries in Asia where students tried to
                    stay in the US</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: I had completed over three years in Indonesia. It was deemed to be time

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Preserving the bases, Subic Bay and Clark Field. There had been a
                    negotiation for an extension of the agreement on the two bases that had started
                    under Bill Sullivan that was still unresolved. We had our first post-war
                    agreement on the bases in the 1950s giving us a 99-year occupancy. At some point
                    before I got there, that period had been changed to 25 years in order to meet
                    internal Philippine political problems. The question I faced was whether to try
                    to extend the agreement beyond the 25 years. A scholar can get all of this out
                    of the records, but there was a date that the Filipinos had set...I guess what
                    the situation was, that while they accepted that we had a 25 year agreement,
                    they wanted to revise some aspects of the agreement. Anyway, the base question
                    was really the primary question.</p>
                <p>The second question was to try to deal with the human rights problems in the
                    Philippines under Marcos. The Carter administration was putting greater emphasis
                    on this and there was an effort to get President Marcos to release some
                    political opponents from jail. One of the things that I worked on, but with
                    somewhat tragic consequences, was to get Benigno Aquino out of jail.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: We got that reversed, but he was still in jail. We got Marcos to agree to
                    let him go to Harvard, which is where he went. But then, of course, when he came
                    back from there he was assassinated.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: They were two men of the same basic background, who wanted the same

                <p>NEWSOM: And Aquino was pictured as a great democrat, and maybe he was. But if you
                    looked at his background it came out that he came from the same kind of
                    oligarchical society that Marcos had come from.</p>

                        always had this thrust, but you had a very aggressive Pat Derian, and
                        others. I know we were feeling it a bit when I was in South Korea around the
                        same time. It would seem to be getting in the way of other matters we
                        considered more important.</hi>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: No, I didn't feel that because I was very sympathetic with the thrust,
                    and while in Indonesia I had played a role in getting the Indonesians to release
                    some 30,000 political detainees that were held over from the 1965 abortive coup
                    in Indonesia. Having observed revolutions in the Middle East, I had a very
                    strong feeling that, if the United States was going to survive in countries
                    where we had an identification with the government, and that government was
                    overthrown, we had to demonstrate that we were not associated, or identified,
                    with some of the practices of that government. When I was in the Department in
                    the Bureau of African Affairs, I was involved in the very early moves in the
                    Congress to establish human rights as a part of the American diplomatic agenda.
                    There's a total misunderstanding of the way human rights developed as a primary
                    concern of the Carter administration. Very few people look at the situation and
                    realize that when Carter came into office there were eleven bits of legislation
                    that required that human rights be taken into account in economic aid, military
                    aid, export credits, a variety of US activities. If one was going to be true to
                    the legislation, there was no way that this could be ignored. This thrust didn't
                    bother me at all, and I endorsed it. And I think that one of the reasons that we
                    were able to survive in the Philippines, where we didn't survive revolutions
                    against friendly rulers elsewhere, was because my predecessors and I went out of
                    our way to demonstrate in various ways to the Philippine people that we did not
                    condone some of the practices of the Marcos administration.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Well, you can speak out on the subject. You don't have to criticize the
                    regime to which you're accredited, but you can talk about the interests of the
                    American people in this subject as demonstrated by the legislation and by
                    presidential statements — fewer in the Reagan administration than in the Carter
                    administration. Although if you look at the Reagan administration which came in
                    vowing to do away with the Assistant Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs, they
                    found that this was a Congressionally mandated position and they couldn't do
                    anything about it. So they had to turn around and embrace some of the same
                    points of view as the Carter administration. But you could do it by speaking
                    out; you can also do it by gestures. One thing that we did infuriated Mrs.
                    Marcos, but I think sent a signal through the Philippine people. There was a
                    Jesuit by the name of Father James Reuter, an American who had at one time been
                    close to the Marcoses but had broken with them and had started a Catholic
                    newspaper, or magazine, which the Marcoses subsequently closed down. Reuter ran
                    an orphanage in the poorer section of Manila, an orphanage for paraplegic
                    children. We put on a benefit for Father Reuter's orphanage in the American
                    embassy. That sent a signal to the Philippines society that we were not
                    intimidated by the fact that the Marcoses don't like Reuter. We're prepared to
                    help him. Jean, my wife, had lunch with Corazon Aquino on one occasion. Mrs.
                    Marcos heard about it and invited us both to lunch on her yacht at the same time
                    that Jean was going to meet with Corazon Aquino. Jean kept her appointment with
                    Corazon Aquino, and I went on the yacht. Mrs. Marcos conspicuously ignored me,
                    talked to the Russian and the Chinese. I felt good about that.</p>

                    talk to him about torture and reports we had of torture being carried out by his
                    security forces. He said something to me like, “Well, you know Mr. Ambassador, I
                    have to depend on these men for my security, and I can't always be monitoring
                    closely what they're doing.” You get the standard responses: “You don't
                    understand our country, or we have a bill of rights in our constitution just
                    like you do” etc. But one aspect that was infuriating related to visitors. A
                    congressional delegation including members of Congress who'd stand up and
                    denounce Marcos on the floor of the House for his violations of human rights. So
                    we'd get ready to go in to meet the president and I would say, You have spoken
                    up critically of Marcos' human rights policies in the House. I want you to say
                    the same things to him here. But they would avoid the subject when they met
                    Marcos. They would say, “Oh, we're here on a friendship mission, Mr. Ambassador.
                    That's your job.” If they realized how it damaged my credibility they didn't pay
                    any attention. I was the one who would tell Marcos that the Philippines had a
                    real problem in the House of Representatives because of the perception of
                    Philippine activities on human rights. Marcos would say, “They came here, they
                    didn't say anything to me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In these delegations were there any really solid
                        supporters, Senators or Congressmen, with a beat in your area that you could
                        call on to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I was there just a short time, but I don't remember any members of
                    Congress coming out and emphasizing problems of human rights. The Marcoses were
                    two of the greatest artists in winning people over, even people who had been
                    critics, and they were marvelous actors in putting on a demeanor and an approach
                    that just swept the average American visitor away. It was something an
                    ambassador had to contend with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem with the staff of your embassy? I'm
                        thinking of a book which I have now read, Dancing with the Dictators. But
                        essentially the title raises the thing that often the Marcoses would coopt
                        people. They would have lots of parties, and things like this. Was this a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: My staff when I was there pretty well saw things the way I did. We were
                    there as the official representatives; we were accredited to the government of
                    the Philippines, which Marcos headed. We had a lot of business that was
                    important to American interests. So we dealt with them properly. But we didn't
                    go out of our way to pander to them. The result was, I'm sure, that I was not a
                    very popular ambassador and probably some of the members of my staff weren't
                    popular with the Marcoses. The Marcoses, particularly Mrs. Marcos, wanted to
                    coopt every American ambassador. She watched you closely, and if you were going
                    to do something that she didn't like, she would try to interfere or get you to
                    come to something that they were doing. Sometimes Mrs. Marcos would just show up
                    at a function and consider herself invited. So it was an interesting tour, but I
                    was never very enamored of the Marcoses.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Well, Marcos was clearly in charge. The Congress was in suspension.
                    Martial law was still on. So, while you dealt with other ministers and other
                    officials, ultimately everything came back to Marcos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On business matters, say the bases, could you talk to
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Oh, yes. Carlos Romulo was the foreign minister, a nice man, old at the
                    time, and kind of sad because he was a man that did have a certain stature. But
                    he pandered so to Marcos that it was sad. However, Marcos was the man you had to
                    deal with. I had a pretty good relationship with him, maybe he in some ways
                    respected the fact that I was prepared to raise difficult questions with
                    him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he respond to a difficult question?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: He was a lawyer, and he liked to respond with legalistic answers. But
                    sometimes his responses were helpful. Mrs. Marcos got the idea that the UN
                    General Assembly should meet in Manila. This was part of her great dream. And it
                    was a horror to the US government because of the cost, and the setting of
                    precedent, and moving the General Assembly, etc. So I went to Marcos and said,
                    “You know we understand the first lady's interest in this; there's certainly no
                    place in the world that we'd rather see the General Assembly than in Manila, but
                    it raises a lot of questions of precedent, and cost.” He said, “The first lady
                    feels very strongly about this. Is there some way you could work out a formula
                    in New York for thanking the Philippines for this gesture, and maybe going on to
                    something else?” That's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the American military? I think of the military
                        leaders, the people coming out from the Defense Department. Did they
                        understand what we were after, or were they sort of fixed on the bases being
                        there, and this is where we're going to be for the rest of our lives. How
                        did you find them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: I found the base commanders, certainly, in particular, the admiral at
                    Subic Bay, very sophisticated, and aware of some of the problems of staying in
                    the Philippines. I had negotiated other base arrangements in Libya, Saudi Arabia
                    and, Morocco, so working with the military on a base negotiation was nothing
                    new. I generally found the military easy to work with if you understood their
                    position, what they wanted to do. If you came up with a dramatic variation in a
                    position and if you could explain it to them and get their acceptance, there was
                    no problem. I always tried, and with reasonable success, to avoid situations in
                    which you had telegrams going back from the post demonstrating divisions in a
                    delegation between the military and non-military members. We tried to work
                    things out in field. I think we did so reasonably well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about what's just come up very recently on Okinawa.
                        Did you have problems about the military...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Oh, enormous problems in the lower-rank military relations with the
                    Filipino community, a constant problem. One of the things we settled in the
                    negotiations that I brought to conclusion was the question of guarding of the
                    base perimeters. Previously there had been Marine guards around the base
                    perimeters, and the bases were the hunting ground for the poor Filipinos living
                    in the villages around, and so they were constantly infiltrating, trying to
                    steal stuff. With American military personnel out there, it was just one
                    continuing series of incidents of Americans stopping and searching women, and
                    then being accused of rape. Or Americans being accused of beating up Filipinos,
                    etc. So we switched it around in the agreement so there was a Filipino guard
                    around the perimeters, and as far as I know that worked well enough until the
                    end of the agreement.</p>
                <p>No, when you have...I've forgotten how many thousand troops we had there at that
                    time, face to face with poor Filipino communities, incidents are
                    inescapable.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to another area. What about immigration? I'm an
                        ex-consular officer, and of course the Philippines has always been a major
                        consular post. How did this impact on your embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: It was one of the few embassies in the world that had an officer solely
                    to deal with fraud, false passports, false papers, false birth certificates. The
                    Filipinos were geniuses at coming up with false documents. We had long lines
                    outside the embassy all the time, and you rarely ran into a Filipino who didn't
                    have a cousin or a brother or something for whom he wanted a visa. So this was a
                    big part of the relationship.</p>

                        I've never served there, I have a feeling that many of these people have
                        been entrenched since the beginning of the century, and they have almost
                        extra territorial privileges, or at least felt that way. If true, would have
                        made it rather difficult because this is not a way to win friends and
                        influence people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Remember, a lot of people left during the war. But there were still some
                    American families spread through the Philippines. I don't remember them as being
                    a problem. One or two of them that I came to know were very helpful in helping
                    us to understand things in the Philippines, but it wasn't a problem as I
                    recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Carter administration? They talked
                        big on human rights, but Carter seemed to be as coopted by the Shah of Iran
                        as Nixon and Kissinger had been. I was wondering, did Carter ever get
                        involved one way or the other with Marcos, or Mrs. Marcos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Generally, my recollection is, that Carter tried to hold the Marcoses at
                    arm's length. I don't remember whether the Marcoses visited Washington during
                    the Carter administration; they certainly didn't on my watch. I know they were
                    delighted when Reagan came in and they were able to visit Washington. There were
                    people in the Carter administration who recognized that we had to deal with the
                    Marcoses, so it wasn't a complete isolation. Dick Holbrooke was the Assistant
                    Secretary for East Asia at the time, and was a realist. So with Marcos himself,
                    and with his government, we had reasonable relations but there were no
                    particularly flowery words that were used. There's always, whatever the
                    inclinations of the President, there's always these difficult balancing acts
                    between dealing with rulers with whom you have to make agreements, and
                    distancing yourself from some of their less desirable features.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: When Philip Habib had his heart attack, and had to leave the position of

                    come back and take the position. This was in March of 1978, and I couldn't say
                    no to an opportunity like that, so I proceeded back to Washington, although I
                    had only been in the Philippines a relatively short time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: There are two approaches to the position, depending really on the desires
                    of the Secretary of State. It can be a kind of high-level special assistant to
                    the Secretary working with him on the problems he seizes on. Or it can be a
                    position that relieves him of a number of issues, and serves as a coordinator of
                    the geographic bureaus. Traditionally, also, the Under Secretary for Political
                    Affairs has been the principal link below the Secretary with the Defense
                    Department and with the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The way I understood it, it represents in the normal State
                        Department as the top professional position to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: It has been that at times. Alex Johnson occupied it for many years, and
                    Phil Habib, of course, was a professional. And until the Reagan administration I
                    think it was seen as a non-political professional position. And if I'm correct,
                    I think both Alex Johnson and Phil Habib were appointed in the administration of
                    one party and continued over into the administration of another. The Reagan
                    administration partially broke that pattern. My successor was Walter Stoessel,
                    who was a professional, but then later he was succeeded by Robert Kimmitt, a
                    political appointee, and Arnold Kantor, who succeeded Kimmitt, had been in the
                    State Department as an arms control specialist, was somewhat out of the pattern.
                    Now the job is held by Peter Tarnoff who was a Foreign Service officer, left at
                    the end of the Carter administration, and then came back in during the Clinton

                <p>NEWSOM: I don't remember precise instructions. I do remember conceiving of the
                    job as coordinating the work of the geographic bureaus, the political-military
                    bureau, the International Organizations Bureau, and picked up responsibility for
                    a number of issues that Phil had been working on. As time evolved, I became sort
                    of the utility in-fielder on the 7th floor picking up new issues, relieving the
                    Secretary of responsibility for issues that he had neither the time nor perhaps
                    the inclination to deal with. I did some Congressional testifying on issues that
                    others preferred not to touch — like Billy Carter, President Carter's brother,
                    and his relations with Libya. I was very much involved in the Nicaraguan problem
                    — how to deal with the collapse of the Somoza regime. While Camp David was going
                    on in September of '78, the Arab-Israeli negotiations, I was taking care of the
                    other issues that were on the table at the time, including Central America,
                    Poland, Iran. Then as the Shah's regime collapsed in Iran, I was put in charge
                    of the task of phasing down the substantial American presence in Iran. We had
                    some 40,000 citizens in business and education, and various other occupations in
                    Iran whom we had eventually to get out of the country. I was rather on the
                    fringes of the hostage crisis, but mainly because I was dealing with the other
                    issues of security of citizens in Iran. It was a mixed bag.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's start at the beginning, then we'll pick up these
                        various themes. When you arrived was there something that Phil Habib said,
                        this is something I'm leaving to you and you've really got to settle, or any
                        things of this nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: As I recall Phil was out of action when I arrived. When he got out of the
                    hospital we did talk, and he would call me from time to time with advice. But my
                    principal contact was really the Secretary. I don't really recall that initial
                    period except that it was rather like being thrown quickly into a very active
                    scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about how you perceived your relations
                        with Cyrus Vance. I think of him as being a trouble shooter. He'd gone out
                        to Cyprus where there were problems. And a lawyer, as with our present
                        Secretary of State Warren Christopher, tend to look upon a situation and a
                        problem and deal with that. Here we're talking about a huge array of
                        responsibilities. How did Cyrus Vance, during the time you worked with him,
                        deal with all these responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: He delegated well. We had a meeting every morning at 7:40 a.m. of the
                    Secretary, Warren Christopher, myself, Peter Tarnoff who was then the head of
                    the Secretariat, Tony Lake who was the head of Policy Planning Staff, Hodding
                    Carter who was the spokesperson. We went over the events of the previous 24
                    hours. The Secretary would assign, or reinforce responsibilities, then we took
                    off from there. I would touch base with him where I needed to. Once you were
                    given responsibility he pretty well assumed that you would carry it out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary Vance had obviously been involved with special
                        missions, and he'd already been Secretary of State for almost two years by
                        the time you got there, or a year and a half.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes, about 15 months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he perceived at that time? I'm thinking some
                        Secretaries of State are considered rather strong leaders, others are
                        not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I think he was highly respected, and I think there was a general
                    recognition that he had problems because of the unwillingness of President
                    Carter sometimes to make a clear decision between positions held by Vance and
                    positions held by Brzezinski, particularly relating to the Soviet Union. But he
                    was a man who was greatly respected, certainly in the Department, and I think
                    generally throughout the government. But the problems between the Secretary of
                    State and the National Security advisor were not unique to the Carter
                    administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with Brzezinski?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: They were cordial. I didn't have much to do with him directly. I dealt
                    more with David Aaron, his principal deputy. We got along fine. Brzezinski, if
                    you read his book, lumped all of us in a kind of wimpish category from the
                    Secretary on down because we had somewhat different ideas than he did about
                    East-West issues. But it was a reasonably cordial relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The big issue, of course, was East-West...we're talking
                        about the Soviet Union, and Carter came in with the idea that maybe one
                        could come to a better understanding with the Soviet Union. Am I correct on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes. I think he felt confrontation was not going to gain anything. I
                    wasn't there in the first year. The first year they had a major debate within
                    the administration over what to do about Somalia, and whether to reinforce the
                    Somalis to go to war with the Marxist Ethiopians. The State Department held out
                    against that. That was the beginning of the division over policies toward the
                    USSR. Brzezinski placed a lot of emphasis on the Soviet activities in the third
                    world, in Angola, Indochina, his 'arc of crisis' concept. We in the State
                    Department tended to see these more as local issues exacerbated by Soviet
                    intervention, but not necessarily part of a Soviet grand plan. We had some quiet
                    negotiations with the Cubans, for example, over getting the Bay of Pigs
                    prisoners released, and we were under strict admonition from Brzezinski that if
                    the Cubans raised anything else, we were to raise the need for them to get their
                    troops out of Angola. That precluded any wider discussions with the Cubans.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on this, but at the time, first you had
                        Kissinger, then you had Brzezinski, both of these being academic political
                        scientists...we're now speaking at the Georgetown School of Foreign Service,
                        but tend to see things in big terms, and movements. Whereas a Foreign
                        Service officer considers each country being unique. There may be internal
                        things, and that these so-called great movements probably when translated
                        into individual countries, tend to get dissipated. It's a completely
                        different viewpoint isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: A somewhat different viewpoint, and I think it's not just the Foreign
                    Service officers. A man like Cyrus Vance, a lawyer, also saw problems in their
                    regional dimensions, or their national dimensions. He saw them as problems, not
                    part of some grander sweep. I do think that Kissinger's training did create in
                    him quite a remarkable sense of the inter-connectedness of problems. You'd go in
                    and see him about something in the Middle East, and he would say, how does that
                    relate to what might happen in China, or Russia. He was more pragmatic than he
                    was ideological, and part of that pragmatism was based on a kind of sense of
                    global connections. Brzezinski was more ideological in his approach to issues.
                    So it was not so much with Brzezinski, well, how is this connected with that,
                    but what are the Soviets up to?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about the Soviets at this time, there was a big
                        fervor over the so-called Soviet brigade in Cuba. Did you get involved in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes, I wrote a book about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain a bit about what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: In March of 1978, Dr. Brzezinski, concerned that there were Soviet-backed
                    activities going on in Cuba, asked the intelligence community to review
                    unclassified intercepted traffic from Cuba. Cuba had been taken off the priority
                    list of intelligence gathering, and certainly of aerial surveillance, primarily
                    for budgetary reasons. In the review of that traffic there came up references to
                    a Soviet brigade. On that basis, in July of '79, it was agreed that SR-71
                    flights, high-level aerial reconnaissance, would begin over Cuba. That aerial
                    reconnaissance revealed a tank unit of brigade size in a camp where the language
                    used was clearly Russian. So it was assumed that this was a Russian unit. And
                    then other photography disclosed that it had moved out of the camp and was doing
                    maneuvers on a beach in south Cuba. The intelligence community then put out an
                    intelligence note saying that aerial photographs had discovered a “combat”
                    brigade in Cuba.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>There's nothing that triggers leaks more in Washington than some kind of
                    sensational word. Senator Richard Stone of Florida, with a big Cuban
                    constituency in Florida, and politically harmed by the fact that he had
                    supported the Panama Canal Treaty, was looking for ways to enhance his support
                    in the Cuban community, so he was constantly looking for information about
                    activities in Cuba that he could use to embarrass the administration, and show
                    his interest in Cuba.</p>
                <p>In July of '78 someone in the Defense Department tipped him off, not to the
                    brigade, but to reports of the Soviets' building a submarine base in Cuba. So in
                    July he asked Harold Brown, the Secretary of Defense, in a Senate hearing
                    whether the Soviets were preparing a base in Cuba. And Brown said there was no
                    information to that effect and Stone got a commitment in a letter that, if there
                    were a Soviet base, the United States would do something about it.</p>
                <p>In my office, we saw the intelligence note about the “combat” brigade, and we
                    weren't planning to do anything about it. Then a reporter from Aviation Week
                    called a member of my staff to ask about this combat brigade in Cuba. I went to
                    Vance and said, “This could well leak. I think we ought to inform Senator Stone
                    and others of this development.” So we did. We informed Stone and Clement
                    Zablocki, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee, and a lot of others,
                    including Frank Church, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee.</p>
                <p>Church was campaigning in Idaho in a very difficult campaign, which he
                    subsequently lost. So he immediately went to the airwaves and demanded that the
                    administration get rid of this brigade. And, of course, Stone immediately wanted
                    to know what this was all about? Is this a base? Everything like that relating
                    to Cuba immediately brings up specters of the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
                <p>We got in touch with the Soviets who came back and said: there's nothing new,
                    this has been there for 16 years. Nobody was prepared to believe them because it
                    was not a response that would have washed with the Congress and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador, was in Moscow at the time; his father
                    was ill. Vance was away, but came back. Vance hoped that he could finesse the
                    growing uproar over the Soviet brigade. The Soviets, however, were not prepared
                    to make even cosmetic changes that might have taken the Carter administration
                    off the hook. Ultimately, Carter made some additional naval deployments in the
                    Caribbean and the matter was largely dropped.</p>
                <p>In the midst of this a transcript of a Senate hearing was brought to my
                    attention. It revealed that Robert McNamara had told the Senate Arms Forces
                    Committee in 1962 after the Cuban missile crisis, that the Soviets would be
                    leaving a unit in Cuba at the very place where this unit was identified. The
                    principal lesson out of all of this was that the State Department and
                    government, has no institutional memory.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>What I didn't know, also, when I called Church was that in the Cuban missile
                    crisis, before July of 1962, rumors had reached the White House of Soviet
                    missiles in Cuba. And Kennedy had called Frank Church, a young senator at that
                    time, and asked him on behalf of the administration to deny these rumors. So
                    this was a repeat of what he had been through. His demand for action was
                    understandable.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I've written a little book on it, because it is an interesting indication
                    of how the political use of intelligence can create an unnecessary incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we move more or less for this period
                        geographically. The fall of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua turned out to be
                        a long lasting concern because of the rise of the Sandinistas. This was
                        obviously not your area of expertise at the time. What were you getting from
                        ARA, and how comfortable did you feel with the reporting and outlook towards
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Underlying this whole administration were differences of views between
                    the National Security staff and the State Department. These were manifested
                    particularly in the Central American area. Bob Pastor dealt with Latin America
                    on the National Security Council staff. Pete Vaky was the Assistant Secretary
                    for the American Republics (ARA), and then he was succeeded by Bill Bowdler. I
                    had very great confidence in the ARA bureau. I think they served us well. My
                    task was primarily to deal with some of the Congressional aspects, and
                    occasionally with the problems that may have arisen because of different
                    perceptions between us and the NSC. I think the NSC was concerned, as is their
                    proper role, with the domestic-political fallout of Central American events, and
                    these had to be reconciled with what we felt were steps to be taken for our
                    foreign policy purposes.</p>
                <p>I had to deal with two members of Congress who were very pro-Somoza. One of them,
                    John Murphy of New York, had been a roommate of Somoza's at some point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At West Point, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I think it was West Point. These two congressmen were very much opposed
                    to what they saw as our efforts to undermine Somoza. We saw it, not as an effort
                    to undermine Somoza, but as a way of trying to maintain a moderate government in
                    Nicaragua when all the evidence indicated that Somoza was finished. We started
                    the OAS mediation effort in which there was a three country group, the US,
                    Guatemala and Jamaica, in an effort to negotiate a moderate alternative to
                    Somoza. These two Congressmen would call Somoza and tell him, “Don't pay any
                    attention to what Bowdler and the others are saying, we've got the situation
                    well in hand in Washington.”</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Charles Wilson of Texas. It was one of the most blatant efforts by
                    members of Congress to undermine official policy that I've ever experienced.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: I knew Murphy because he had been involved with the oil business in
                    Indonesia at one time when I was there. Since I was one of the very few people
                    in the Department who knew him, and who he would talk to, I would call him and
                    try to explain how we saw things. I was never very successful in persuading him
                    that our perception was correct. At one point I remember he made the statement
                    to me when I was talking about Somoza as being undemocratic, he said, 'I know
                    what democracy is, and Somoza practices democracy. I've seen democracy practiced
                    in Staten Island.' Well, I don't know what that said about democracy in Staten
                    Island.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: I don't think we had any illusions. Our efforts were directed at creating
                    a conservative political group, including some of Somoza's own supporters whom
                    we felt might gain support within Nicaragua as a whole as an alternative to
                    Somoza. And that was an uphill battle because on the one hand you had the people
                    that thought we should give more support to Somoza, and those that felt that we
                    should perhaps be more interventionist to try to prevent the rise of the
                    Sandinistas. Because of what we were trying to do, we were accused of being
                    starry-eyed. We had some direct encounters. I remember testifying before a
                    Congressional committee to be followed immediately by Frank Carlucci, then
                    deputy director of CIA, who took issue publicly with everything that I had
                    said.</p>
                <p>The real problem came after the Sandinistas were in power when you had the
                    classic problem of whether to try to work with such a group by providing them
                    with assistance in the hopes that we can have some influence on them, or assume
                    that they are totally hopeless. We had people in ARA who felt we should try to
                    work with them, and we did get $75 million, I think, in assistance. But that was
                    not a terribly successful policy.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: You always have the dilemma when a new revolutionary group comes into

                    developments? Or do you try to work with them in the hopes of having some
                    influence, if not on them, on others in the country? If you abandon everything,
                    it's often much more difficult to get back in when things may be turning. This
                    is an argument that went on after Afghanistan, it went on after Libya, its gone

                <p>NEWSOM: Argentina. The junta was in power in Argentina in 1978. A
                    Humphrey-Kennedy amendment to the foreign assistance act called for cutting off
                    all military sales in cooperation with Argentina by October 1, 1978, unless
                    there were improvements in the human rights situation. So I was sent to
                    Argentina sometime in the fall of '78, before this date, to see whether I could
                    create any momentum on human rights issues that might make the application of
                    this amendment unnecessary.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: That's right. And the Defense Department was very unhappy about what they
                    saw as a State Department effort to cut off military cooperation with this key
                    country in the southern cone. One senior defense official came to me early in my
                    time there, and said, “I hope you can turn around this State Department effort
                    to cut off military arrangements with Argentina; it's not in our interest.” I
                    said, “Well, Mr. Secretary, we may be required to cut off this cooperation by
                    the Humphrey-Kennedy amendment. Would you want this Democratic administration to
                    go up and ask for the repeal of an amendment carrying the names of two
                    Democratic party stalwarts?” “ Oh, no.” So that ended that conversation.</p>

                <p>My trip to Argentina was unsuccessful because there was such a balance of
                    intrigue among the members of the junta. No one wanted to take any
                    responsibility in accounting for those who had disappeared by permitting an
                    external group to examine human rights. There was nothing they were prepared to
                    do that would have precluded the implementation of this amendment.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Cuba. We had the Mariel boatlift. We tried to turn that around, but we
                    encountered the highly emotional feelings in south Florida about the possibility
                    of recovering grandmothers and cousins. I remember a very difficult meeting that
                    Warren Christopher and I had with a group from Dade County, Florida, with
                    Cuban-American leaders. This is just after the Mariel boatlift began, which, as
                    you know, is when Castro encouraged Cubans to take the small boats and head for
                    the United States. So the White House invited about 40 Cuban-American leaders to
                    come initially for a meeting with Vice President Mondale. As the time
                    approached, and as the politics of this became clearer, Mondale was suddenly
                    unavailable. So it fell to Warren Christopher and me to meet with them. Very
                    shortly after we started, one of the visitors got up and said, “Are we here to
                    talk about overthrowing Castro?” And Warren said, “No, that's not the purpose of
                    this meeting.” The visitor said, “Well, if that's not the purpose of this
                    meeting, we're wasting our time.” And he got up and, with about half the group,
                    walked out.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: We did have some meetings with Cubans that at the time were very secret.
                    I think they've been mentioned since. The purpose was to work out the release of
                    some of the Bay of Pigs prisoners. The talks were successful in that we did work
                    out a formula for the release of a number of men that had been held since the
                    Bay of Pigs event. We were very much constrained by Dr. Brzezinski in what we
                    could talk about in those meetings. The Cubans wanted always to expand the
                    agenda to talk about the embargo and other US-Cuban relations. But our
                    instructions were that we were to talk about nothing but the prisoner release,
                    and if they wanted to raise other things, we were to talk about Angola, the
                    Cuban troops in Angola. When we talked about the Cuban troops in Angola, the
                    Cuban said that was none of our business: “We're there at the invitation of the
                    Angolan government. We have a long tradition of links with Africa.” So we never
                    got beyond the single issue.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: He was the Deputy Secretary, and he also chaired a committee which was
                    supposed to reconcile human rights issues. We got these cases finally referred
                    to his committee so that they could be resolved. There was a lot of feeling
                    throughout the Carter administration on the part of people in geographic bureaus
                    that the Human Rights Bureau was exceeding its mandate and creating unnecessary
                    problems. I was always somewhat sympathetic with the Human Rights Bureau because
                    they were trying to deal with some very serious situations such as the one in
                    Argentina. But these were very real examples of the need to reconcile often two
                    opposite objectives, and if I did anything it was to bring cases to a point of
                    reconciliation, rather than just have them fester.</p>

                    might take on most favored nation status. They came down to specific issues. And
                    Warren and his committee tried to resolve these on the basis of what seemed to
                    make the most sense politically and diplomatically. Frequently nobody was happy
                    with the resolution but there was a resolution. One of the cases that was very
                    prominent, for example, was whether to supply crowd control equipment to the
                    Shah's regime in Iran in 1978. The Human Rights Bureau was strongly opposed. NEA
                    was for it, and ultimately it was decided to send the riot control equipment.

                <p>NEWSOM: She certainly had her own constituency in the Congress. One of the things
                    that happened in the Carter administration was that a number of the members of
                    Congressional staffs, who had been responsible for launching and successfully
                    getting passed a lot legislation relating to human rights, came up to the State
                    Department as part of Pat Derian's staff. So there was a very close link between
                    members of her staff and members of the Congress who were in favor of human
                    rights legislation. I never had the feeling that her links in the White House
                    were very good. But she did have that strong Congressional constituency.</p>

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: South Africa was an issue. You had the Rhodesian problem, the unilateral
                    declaration of independence, and the Ian Smith government was in power at the
                    time. That was something that Secretary Vance had a very great personal interest
                    in, and I was not very much involved in the negotiations on Rhodesia which Vance
                    handled primarily with Don McHenry, and directly with David Owen who was the
                    British Foreign Secretary at the time. The main African issue that I became
                    involved in was the question of Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Before I came in
                    there had been a basic difference between the State Department and the White
                    House over how to interpret, or how to deal with Somalia. By that time the
                    Mengistu pro-communist regime was in power in Ethiopia. The Somalis had cut off
                    their relations with the Soviet Union, and were looking for help from the west
                    to invade the Ogaden area that had long been in dispute between Ethiopia and
                    Somalia. Because there were Cuban troops helping the Ethiopians, the White House
                    very much wanted us to see Somalia as a chosen instrument to harass the regime
                    in Addis Ababa. The State Department, particularly the Assistant Secretary for
                    African Affairs, Dick Moose, who I think was very pressured at the time, felt
                    that Somalia was a morass, that we shouldn't get involved with. So there was a
                    kind of stalemate through most of my time there over Somalia, but it was a
                    matter of constant discussion.</p>

                        and the viability of our policy and where it was going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: Two or three incidents stand out in my memory about that time. I think it
                    was in April of '78 that Bill Sullivan, our ambassador in Tehran, came in on
                    consultation. In talking to him about how things were there, he made the point
                    that we knew too little about the religious establishment, particularly the
                    Mullahs in Qom, a religious center. But it was very difficult to get a handle on
                    this group because the Shah was strongly opposed to any diplomatic contacts with
                    the religious leaders. Bill was, I think, perceptive in seeing that this was
                    something where things were happening that we didn't know too much about. I went
                    out to Iran in July of '78 to tell the Shah that we weren't prepared to deliver
                    him a new generation of aircraft. I had a meeting with him. We didn't know
                    anything about his illness at that time. But as I look back at that meeting, I
                    think he was saying things that perhaps we should have taken more seriously at
                    the time. I remember his saying to me that he was interested in reform because
                    he wanted to be sure that he could turn a viable democratic Iran over to his
                    son, the Crown Prince. He was clearly thinking about the end of his regime at
                    that time. Most of our conversation was on Afghanistan, and what had happened in
                    the emergence of the Taraki regime in Afghanistan. As things deteriorated in
                    Iran with the riots in September, our people in the State Department became more
                    and more concerned about what was happening there. We sent three young officers,
                    at least one of whom was fluent in Farsi, out to Iran in September to take a
                    feeling of what was happening there. They came back with a very pessimistic
                    account of the degree to which the Shah and his government seemed to be out of
                    touch with what was happening. Dr. Brzezinski was very strongly opposed to our
                    efforts to find out what was happening in Iran. He would not listen to these
                    three men when they came back. He excluded Henry Precht, who was the country
                    director for Iran, from NSC meetings in the White House because he felt that
                    Henry and others had an animus toward the Shah and were trying to further his
                    ouster. I was in the middle of this tension between the State Department and the
                    NSC throughout the Iran business. And I frequently had to represent the State
                    Department in meetings in which two opposing views were presented. One, the
                    State Department feeling that the NSC did not realize the degree to which the
                    Shah was being undermined, or was unable to cope with the situation. And Dr.
                    Brzezinski, who was in constant touch with the Iranian ambassador in Washington,
                    Zahedi, insisted that things were alright, and that if the Shah would just
                    exercise the iron fist, all would be well.</p>

                        bad things about the Shah. I mean, it's a pernicious policy.</hi>

                <p>NEWSOM: I remember one time when Dr. Brzezinski said he couldn't understand why
                    an army of 300,000 couldn't put down the troubles happening in Iran. What he
                    didn't realize was that half of the 300,000 were conscripts, and that when the
                    Shah weakened there was no military command structure that could really take
                    action. I remember being sent to the telephone to call Bill Sullivan. We had a
                    code word for a coup d'etat, to ask him whether a coup was possible. And Bill
                    uttered an oath over the phone, and said, “Right now our MAAG mission is in a
                    bunker, bullets are flying over them between the Imperial Guard and the air
                    force cadets who have joined the revolution. What the hell are you thinking
                    about?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that the fact you had the NSC hanging on to
                        something we were seeing increasingly as a lost cause, did that have a
                        stifling or an inhibiting effect on how we dealt with the situation? Or
                        maybe it was something we couldn't have dealt with no matter what.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: It didn't help. The Iranian ambassador, who kept insisting that all was
                    well, didn't help because all was not well. But whether anything we could have
                    done would have reversed the revolution, I don't know. We had proposed at one
                    time to send Ted Eliot, who had been a former director of Iranian affairs, out
                    to Paris to talk to the Ayatollah Khomeini and his group. That was vetoed by the
                    White House. Subsequent events suggested that Khomeini would have treated Eliot
                    as he treated so many visitors from the west with a degree of contempt, and we
                    probably wouldn't have gained very much. We were riding out a revolution.</p>
                <p>There was one critical turning point affected by Dr. Brzezinski's activism. When
                    the embassy was invaded the first time in February, actually Valentine's Day,
                    1979, we were able with the help of a man named Mohammed Yazdi and the prime
                    minister at that time, Bakhtiar, to get the Iranians to help in throwing out the
                    invaders and getting the embassy back. When the hostages were seized in
                    November, we hoped to repeat that by persuading Yazdi and the prime minister to
                    help. But the prime minister had just been at a meeting in Algiers of some group
                    at which Brzezinski was present. And Brzezinski sought him out to talk to him.
                    The fact that he met with Brzezinski damaged his relations with the Ayatollah
                    and his group. When he came back to Iran he no longer had any power. So we had
                    no one with whom we could deal.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: The hostage situation was primarily managed by Hal Saunders and the
                    Secretary himself. I followed it closely, but my only direct contact with it was
                    when I went to Wiesbaden to receive and interview the hostage, Richard Queen,
                    when he was released. I also met the women and black officers who were released
                    earlier. Because Muskie had resigned as of January 19, 1981, I was the interim
                    Secretary of State when the hostages were released. I as involved in their
                    reception and subsequent debriefing. One of the things I had to do was to meet
                    at a very early point with the lawyers for the incoming Reagan administration to
                    convince them not to recommend to the President that he abrogate, or refuse to
                    accept, the Algiers agreement by which the hostages had been released. Some of
                    them were under the impression that this had been a ransom deal. When we were
                    able to point out to them that Warren Christopher had very skillfully negotiated
                    an arrangement in which we used frozen Iranian assets to pay for American
                    claims, we got any move to abrogate the arrangement turned off. Most of the time
                    I was just keeping abreast of the ins and outs of the process.</p>

                        people. What were some of the problems that you ran across getting out this
                        large group of relatively unsophisticated people. These were mechanics,
                        technicians, and all of a sudden they're in the middle of nowhere in an
                        ongoing revolution.</hi>

                <p>NEWSOM: It actually went rather smoothly. We had the cooperation of the business
                    community and institutions. There were a few that didn't think it was necessary
                    to leave. A few wanted substantial payments for the damages they felt they would
                    incur, and we had to negotiate that out. I remember it as a fairly smooth
                    operation. We didn't lose anybody; we had some recalcitrant oil people who
                    didn't think they needed to leave but as the situation deteriorated I think they
                    understood the necessity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Ross Perot come up on your radar at all at that
                        time?</hi>

                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: Oh, yes. His EDS corporation had a big contract with the previous Iranian
                    government. When the new government came in and examined the books they felt
                    that EDS still owed the Iranians a substantial amount of taxes. And when Perot
                    refused to pay, they detained two or three of the executives of this company.
                    Perot saw them as hostages, he didn't acknowledge that they had any claim on the
                    company. So he talked about mounting this commando operation to get them
                    released. What actually happened was that the guards in the prison where they
                    were being held at the time of the revolution just walked away, and everybody
                    walked out of the prison. We were able to arrange for these men to escape over
                    an overland route and come out through Turkey where they were met by our
                    consular people. Perot claimed that he had liberated them. I called him during
                    all of this to tell him his claim was not helpful because we were trying to
                    still maintain the cooperation of the authorities, and it wasn't helpful to have
                    the authorities think that we were trying to go around behind their backs. He
                    acknowledged that there may have been some exaggeration in his story. Now
                    according to a book that Gerald Posner has written on Perot, Perot paid a
                    million dollars to Ken Follett to put his version of this escape into a book
                    called “The Flight of the Eagles”. So this was my confrontation with Ross
                    Perot.</p>

                        during this time, '78 to '81. When you arrived the Carter administration was
                        making a valiant effort to change the confrontation and send Thomas Watson
                        as ambassador there who came from the IBM family. The idea was that he could
                        do business with these people, and maybe we could do something. Was this a
                        divergence from how the State Department was viewing...this is the late

                    handled by the Secretary, and by Marshall Shulman who was the Secretary's
                    special assistant for Soviet affairs. All of that has been pretty well

                    regime, martial law in Poland, and the decision to provide Commodity Credit
                    Corporation credits for agricultural commodities to Poland. I went to Poland at
                    one point to talk about family reunification cases, and I was impressed with the
                    resoluteness of the Poles at that time to maintain as much independence from the

                        We're talking about the December 1979 Soviet invasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: It turned around every effort that might then have been in progress to
                    improve relations with the Soviets. It was seen as a Soviet disregard of
                    American concerns about the stability of that part of Asia. Prior to that we had
                    had to deal with what we would do about the Taraki regime which came into power
                    after the fall of the Daud government. There again we were faced, in some ways
                    like Nicaragua, with the question of, do you continue American assistance? I
                    went to Afghanistan, I met with Taraki, and I met with his deputy, Mohammed
                    Amin, and there was no doubt but what they were heavily influenced by the
                    Soviets but wanted to maintain links with the west. So my recommendation was
                    that we try to do that as long as we could do it in an honorable and unimpeded
                    way. Well, that didn't last too long because the Soviet invasion followed.</p>
                <p>We had one episode when a Soviet defector came into our embassy, but there was no
                    way we could get that defector out. So we had to negotiate as much as we could a
                    release with assurances of safety for the soldier, but we never heard what
                    happened to him.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: Yes. We had a lot of action with Pakistan because Pakistan became the
                    focal point for resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That was when we
                    had the problem of trying to help Pakistanis who, at the time of the invasion,
                    were under sanctions because of their nuclear program. So we had to get that
                    reversed and make a decision to provide aid to Pakistan. Unfortunately the
                    amount of aid that we were thinking of providing leaked out. Some reporter
                    approached General Zia, who was the president of Pakistan at the time, and said
                    that he understood that the State Department is talking about $200 millions in
                    aid to Pakistan: “What do you think of that, Mr. President?” And he replied,
                    “Peanuts.” So we lost some of our negotiating room on that. I think we

                        considered that the Soviets were on the move. Within the State Department
                        was this taken seriously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: It was taken very seriously. You had the immediate sanctions after the
                    Soviet invasion including the grain embargo. I had to call Armand Hammer and
                    tell him that he couldn't go ahead with a large petro-chemical plant that he was
                    anticipating constructing in the Soviet Union. We cut off exchanges of various
                    kinds. I don't think there was ever a military option that was considered
                    because the terrain and circumstances made that impossible. But no, it was
                    considered a major turning point with US-Soviets relations.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: There was great debate over what the Soviet objectives were. The more
                    hawkish people saw this as the first thrust of the Soviets toward the Persian
                    Gulf. I think in the State Department there was a general tendency to look at it
                    in terms of what was happening in Afghanistan, to look at the units they were
                    sending in, where they were sending them, to argue that there was nothing in the
                    deployment of the Soviets, and their configuration in Afghanistan which
                    suggested this was a part of a grand push south. And I think that was the
                    correct assessment.</p>

                <p>NEWSOM: No. I followed the ongoing Philippine base negotiations because I had
                    been there, but nothing particularly significant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Several general questions. CIA had undergone a real house
                        cleaning under Carter. How were relations with the CIA at your level, and
                        how you saw them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: They were good. David Aaron of the NSC, Frank Carlucci of the CIA, Bob
                    Komer of the Defense Department, and I met periodically to work on intelligence
                    matters. My recollection is that it was a fairly smooth working organization. I
                    had a lot of admiration for Admiral Stansfield Turner, a man who stood up
                    against sometimes rather bizarre pressures to undertake actions that he didn't
                    think were either feasible or in the national interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Relations with the Department of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: My principal contact was someone I had worked with before, Robert Komer,
                    who was something of a personality. He was the Under Secretary for Policy. I did
                    travel with him to one NATO meeting to be sure that our views were presented in
                    a satisfactorily moderate voice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were to sit on his side and tug on his sleeve. He had
                        the nickname of the blow torch, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I was charged with riding herd on Komer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a last question, I have one more after this. What was
                        your impression about how the Foreign Service officers were used during this
                        time within both the State Department, NSC, and other places?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>NEWSOM: I think they were well used and performed well. The sad outcome of that
                    was that a number of them were severely penalized by the Reagan administration
                    because of their identification with policies that the Reagan administration
                    wanted to reverse. The worst of all cases was that of Bill Bowdler (Assistant
                    Secretary for American Republic Affairs), who has never recovered from being
                    summarily dismissed. I was the interim between the two administrations and
                    during the transition a directive came over from the White House saying that no
                    presidential appointee of the Carter administration should be at his or her desk
                    on January 21st 1981. So I went to Al Haig, who was the designated Secretary of
                    State, and said, “Look this is absurd. You can't operate the State Department
                    effectively without these people. A large number of those on the list are
                    professionals who have carried over from one administration to the other.” So he
                    said, “All right, I'll go over the list with people in the White House, and
                    we'll see if we can't get this reversed.” He did, and came back to say that
                    three officers should not be at their desks. One was Bowdler, another was Peter
                    Tarnoff, who was the head of the Executive Secretariat and was seen as too
                    political by the White House. I don't remember who the third was. But at lower
                    levels, people like Jim Cheek, who worked on Latin American affairs, people who
                    had gotten on the wrong side of Jesse Helms, never recovered during the Reagan
                    years. Some of them got good jobs later but that was a sad episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired at this point, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about Al Haig? He seemed to be
                        somewhat removed from this White House group, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: He was an interesting man to work with. He came in very much influenced
                    by the ideological agenda of the Reagan administration. And part of my job as
                    the interim secretary was to brief him and to try to point out where some of his
                    assumptions about past policies were wrong. And he would listen. In some cases
                    he would change his mind, and in some cases not. What he did do was to dismiss
                    the rather cumbersome and intrusive transition team that had originally been
                    appointed and put three people in charge of the State Department transition.
                    Rick Burt, Paul Wolfowitz, and Kenneth Adelman. I worked with those three who
                    were reasonable men who understood the issues and helped make a fairly smooth
                    transition. It was a crazy transition because Haig wasn't confirmed for four or
                    five days after the inauguration, and then Stoessel wasn't confirmed for another
                    three weeks. So I was the only confirmed officer on the 7th floor other than the
                    Secretary for about a month, and all the Reagan people were at their desks but
                    had no authority. A couple of times Haig went on foreign trips and I became the
                    Acting Secretary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just for the record, where did you go after you
                        retired?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NEWSOM: I came to Georgetown University as the director of the Institute for the
                    Study of Diplomacy and, subsequently, Associate Dean in the School of Foreign
                    Service. I held that job until 1990 when I retired from Georgetown and went to
                    the University of Virginia as the Cumming Professor of International Relations,
                    a position that I still hold. I had a leave of absence last year to be the
                    interim dean in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown. I seem to have some
                    expertise at being interim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we'll leave at that point. Great.</hi>
