                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that you were born in 1925 in Illinois. I wonder
                        if you could give me a bit about your background, your family and early
                        upbringing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I was born in Moline, Illinois in a Swedish community. My mother is the
                    youngest of five children born in Sweden. Her father was a master cabinet maker
                    in Sweden. He came to the United States and worked for a while to get
                    established then got his wife and five children. My mother was five years old at
                    the time they came to the United States. My father was born in Rock Island,
                    Illinois, and his father and his uncle immigrated from Switzerland. It's a Swiss
                    name that comes from the area of Winterhur in the German part of Switzerland.
                    It's a name that's also common in the nearby parts of Germany, the southern
                    part, and even into Austria. It is often spelled with a z, or zed as they call
                    it. One time I was in Zurich, the largest city near where my father's family
                    came from. I thought I would look in the telephone book, because there was never
                    more than one other Sulser in any phone book any place I ever lived, so I
                    thought it was not a terribly common name. In Zurich I thought if there were a
                    few others there I might call and see if I was distantly related, because I knew
                    my grandfather and his brother left relatives in Switzerland when they
                    immigrated in the late 19th century. But I found, in fact, one whole page of
                    Sulsers in the Zurich telephone book. The page was in three columns. Two columns
                    were spelled Sulzer and one column was spelled Sulser. My grandfather was named
                    Christian Sulser and my uncle was Jacob. There were several Jacobs and several
                    Christians, so needless to say I didn't telephone any of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father's work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SULSER: He did many jobs. He was the youngest of two boys of the Sulser name. His
                    father died when my father was only five years old, and his mother remarried a
                    man named Maas, who came from Northern Germany, and proceeded to have two girls.
                    So my father had two somewhat younger sisters. He was the mainstay of the family
                    because my grandmother's second husband left after fathering these two girls,
                    never to be heard from again. My father's older brother was never steadily
                    employed. So my father was the breadwinner of the family. He left school after
                    8th grade and worked in a variety of jobs but finally wound up as a meatcutter
                    and became a member of the meatcutter's union, which he still is. He was 90
                    years old last week. The older brother died when he was only 55. My father had
                    always said that he was sure that since both the men in his family had died by
                    the time they were 55 that he'd never live beyond that age. He still lives in
                    Rock Island, Illinois with my mother, who is 89, and he drove out here just last
                    year by himself. But in the meantime his health has worsened and he's not able
                    to walk without the assistance of canes now.</p>
                <p>My mother did graduate high school. An uncle of my father was director of
                    planning at Rock Island Arsenal and a member of the school board—in fact he
                    handed me my diploma when I graduated from high school, which was a nice family
                    touch. His son, about 8 years older than I am, graduated college just before the
                    second world war started. He talked at various times, I remember, about possibly
                    going in the “diplomatic service.” It was the first time I ever heard that this
                    was something that somebody of our background out of a small town in the middle
                    west might possibly think of as a career. But it didn't register with me at the
                    time as a possible career. This second cousin also got a law degree before going
                    into the Army, becoming an artillery battalion commander in the 104th Infantry
                    Division. After the war he taught law at the University of Oregon and became
                    Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume you went to high school in...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, I graduated from Rock Island High School in 1943, 50 years ago last
                    year. All the way through school and in church and whatnot, I was active in all
                    the musical and dramatic things. Those were my interests, never much involved in
                    sports, and was always good in school, had good grades. But I never really had
                    much of an idea of what I wanted to do with my life. In high school we had a
                    very active vocal music and dramatics program. I was in everything that went on,
                    and we had a radio broadcast studio in high school that was connected with the
                    commercial station downtown. We did our own scripts, our own productions,
                    programs, announcing. I was an announcer in these high school broadcasts that
                    were relayed over the local commercial station. When the war came along, the
                    announcers at the commercial station started getting drafted, and one day the
                    program director called me up and asked if I'd be interested in coming to work
                    at the station to fill in for these absent announcers. So I became a paid radio
                    announcer for the first time and I enjoyed that very much. It made me a part of
                    the community. Everybody knew my name, because I read the evening newscasts and
                    I had the late night record program, disc-jockey you might call it. I thought
                    that seemed like a nice way to make a living, and I intended to do that for the
                    rest of my life.</p>
                <p>I worked earlier at other jobs too, supermarkets, general stores, and what we
                    used to call army stores in those days. A high school friend of my father had a
                    gas station and I worked there on weekends. I happened to be working the day of
                    Pearl Harbor. In those days people were out for drives on Sunday. In those
                    little midwestern towns there wasn't an awful lot else to do. If it was a nice
                    day you went for a drive. And most cars didn't have radios in those days. We had
                    a radio in the gas station where I spent the day pumping gas, so we heard about
                    it on the radio. As people came in to get gas, I would tell them about Pearl
                    Harbor, giving them all the news through the open windows of their cars as I was
                    gassing them up. The next day at school there was a lot of talk about what this
                    meant, a lot of people had older brothers or fathers who were of military age
                    who were registered for the draft. This was going to impact a lot of peoples'
                    lives. After one of our rehearsals that went on every day after school, the
                    music director was driving me home. He lived not far from where I did. We were
                    talking about the war and what this would do to families. I began to cry because
                    I was only 16 years old and I thought I would never get to serve, that the war
                    would finish before I was able to get in it and this was a terrible shame. It
                    was a sad thing and I was worried. This professor, as we called him, told me he
                    thought the war would probably last long enough for me to get in it. Indeed it
                    did. The next year I finished high school. I was 17 and I enlisted, didn't wait
                    to register for the draft or be called.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I had a choice of two college training programs because I had high enough grades:
                    ASTP (Army Specialized Training Program) and the Navy one was V-12 or something.
                    Although I grew up on the banks of the Mississippi River and had friends and
                    family who were water people, with boats and all that, without a moment's
                    hesitation I checked ASTP. Since I was still only 17 years old, the Army said I
                    should go to the University of Wisconsin in an ASTP Reserve Program. At the end
                    of the term when you become 18, you go take your basic training and go on active
                    duty and then go back to finish the four-year program and be commissioned as an
                    army engineer. I became 18 during the first term of this reserve program, went
                    off to active duty, basic training at the infantry school at Fort Benning,
                    Georgia. While I was there, they decided they needed infantry replacements for
                    the eventual invasions of Europe and Japan more than they needed engineers four
                    years later, so I never went back to the program. I went straight from basic
                    training into an infantry division, the 106th Infantry Division. I went from
                    Fort Benning to Camp Atterbury, Indiana where the Division was due to arrive a
                    couple of days later after two months of maneuvers in Tennessee. The Division
                    had been formed and trained earlier in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. So I and
                    others from this program, all of whom thought that when they went into the Army
                    they'd be going back to college; but instead there they were sitting in Camp
                    Atterbury waiting for this Infantry Division to arrive on Base. And it did,
                    coming off very wet, muddy maneuvers, with trucks and uniforms and everything
                    covered with mud. We had just come from a spit and polish infantry school in
                    Fort Benning, and I thought—This looks like an awful miserable outfit to be
                    associated with. It looked better after they got themselves cleaned up! Then we
                    got parceled out to various units in the Division that needed to be filled out.
                    I wound up in a Rifle Company. Shortly after that, within a couple of weeks,
                    several thousand soldiers of all ranks, including officers from that Division
                    were taken out to be sent overseas as individual replacements. This suddenly
                    opened up a lot of slots for noncommissioned officers, and within a month of
                    joining this Division I became a machine gun squad leader. Unlike those who had
                    trained with the unit from the beginning, training only in the weapon that they
                    were personally armed with, in the Infantry School we were trained in every
                    weapon in the Infantry arsenal in those days. I had, without any trouble at all,
                    scored highest marks with each weapon and got an expert badge in each, except
                    for the 45 caliber pistol, which I had to refire three or four times to even get
                    the lowest qualifying grade, much less the expert rank. But machine gun was one
                    of the things I was expert in, so I became a machine gun squad leader almost
                    overnight and was promoted rapidly, as fast as you could be, to sergeant. I went
                    overseas with the 106th which was the Division that was most chewed up in the
                    Battle of the Bulge. It had just arrived at the front, taking over for the 2nd
                    Infantry Division the week before the German attack in December of '44.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, that was a place that was being used to get
                        people acclimated to the...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SULSER: That's right, and to give people a rest after combat. There were two U.S.
                    divisions in that sector: the 28th Division which had been in action ever since
                    Normandy and had been badly chewed up a month before in the Hustgen forest
                    battles. They were sent down there to rest and recover from their wounds and to
                    absorb replacements for their casualties. Our Division was to get some easy
                    front-line experience before the major offensive that was expected in the spring
                    to complete the defeat of Germany. In fact, the combat troops of the 106th were
                    already in Germany, over the border about 5 or 6 miles. Two regiments of the
                    three were sticking out into an area called the Schnee-eifel, and the third was
                    back a little to the south, just above the 28th Infantry Division. When the
                    German attack came those two regiments were surrounded within 24 hours. They
                    were not attacked frontally, as we were spread so thinly in that area that there
                    were large gaps, hundreds of yards sometimes between squads and outposts and
                    what not, and the Germans in reconnoitering the area before the attack saw that,
                    so they didn't attack us frontally, just went around the holes on either side of
                    the two regiments, closing the noose behind us. When we finally after three days
                    got the order to try and turn around and fight our way back out, it was too
                    late. We hadn't had anything to eat for three days. With flanking attacks on
                    both sides that took place during that time, we had expended virtually all the
                    ammunition. We had only whatever rifle, pistol, carbine each man was armed with,
                    and by that time the Germans had brought in tanks and 88-millimeter
                    anti-aircraft guns, which they used as ground weapons. Bad weather had grounded
                    all U.S. aircraft since the battle began. In the day we were trying to fight our
                    way out we were very badly mauled, losing at least a third of our forces, so the
                    two regimental commanders instructed the rest to surrender. It was the largest
                    surrender of the U.S. Army since Corregidor when the remnants of two regiments
                    surrendered and spent the rest of the war in POW camp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Parker was in that, did you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, he was also in the 106th Division. He was in the 422nd regiment
                    anti-tank company. A lieutenant there. I had run into Dick occasionally in the
                    Foreign Service, but in the 34 years I was in the Foreign Service I never really
                    talked much about military experience or expressed any great interest in anybody
                    else's military service. But a few years ago I was at a seminar in Fairfax,
                    Virginia that was convened by an outfit that had a contract with the U.S. Army
                    to do a study on how soldiers behave when their unit is getting beaten. The Army
                    thought maybe there were some lessons to be learned to prepare people in the
                    future for such contingencies. This organization contacted half a dozen people
                    in this area who had been in the 106th sector to spend a day sitting around a
                    table talking about their experiences. I knew each of the others except one man
                    at the other side of the table that I thought looked familiar. He was looking at
                    me too, but he didn't place me any more than I placed him. About half way
                    through the morning we had a coffee break and I went up to him and spoke to him.
                    It turned out it was Dick Parker. It was the first I had known he had been in
                    the 106th Division also.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>Only this year I learned that John Bladgett had been in the same Regiment (the
                    423rd) with me. Thus, the 106 Division provided at least three veterans to the
                    Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when you...were you taken back to
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: After the two regiments surrendered we marched back for several hours to
                    the next town in Germany, which was Bleialf, spending the night in an open
                    churchyard there, gravestones and whatnot, a wall and guards around the
                    churchyard. The next day we marched farther into Germany, to a town called
                    Gerolstein, where most of us were herded into boxcars that had been used to
                    bring horses up to the front. Gasoline was very short in the German army so they
                    still used horses to transport a lot of their supply wagons and artillery
                    pieces. They brought up thousands of horses to prepare for this battle in
                    boxcars and then loaded them up with prisoners, 60 or so guys jammed into each
                    car that had a layer of horse manure on the floor. Of course these boxcars were
                    not airtight, had little gaps between the boards. By then it was the 21st of
                    December of 1944 and the weather was very cold, a lot of snow around. I found
                    out only in the last ten years, when I've gotten involved with some veteran
                    organizations for the first time, that some of the men didn't have enough
                    boxcars and marched for days to POW camps. I guess I was fortunate to get into a
                    boxcar and ride the rest of the way. Standing up, because there was not enough
                    room for anybody to sit down. The trains moved very slowly and stopped
                    frequently for trains going in the other direction, towards the front, sitting
                    on sidings much of the time. On Christmas Eve we spent the night at the railway
                    yards at Limburg, and the RAF came over and bombed the railyard while this
                    trainload of prisoners confined in boxcars was sitting there. Shrapnel was
                    ripping through the wooden sides of the boxcars and they were tipping on the
                    rails from one side to the other. The guards took off for the air-raid shelters
                    and left us sitting in the railyard being blown around. Somehow, everyone dived
                    for the floor; of course the guys at the bottom were pressed into the horse
                    manure. There was a lot of praying to Jesus and Holy Mary and Mother of God and
                    everybody screaming and yelling like mad. As soon as the bombing ended it was
                    “you son of a bitch get your boot out of my face.” The atmosphere changed very
                    quickly. No one in our car was hurt, but we found out afterward that several
                    people were killed in other boxcars that were closer to where the bombs
                    landed.</p>
                <p>The next day we went along and arrived at the first prison camp, which turned out
                    to be Stalag 9-B at a place called Bad-Orb, about halfway between Frankfurt and
                    Fulda as I found out much later. At the time, of course, we had no idea where
                    the heck we were. We got out of the boxcars on Christmas Day 1944 and marched up
                    the hill. Being a holiday in Germany, the townspeople were out in the street in
                    their Christmas best, munching on cookies and other goodies, little children and
                    adults watching us march by. We must have been a very sad sight, because by that
                    time we had not had anything to eat for a week or more, nothing to drink except
                    whatever we happened to have in our canteens when we were captured. Our uniforms
                    must have been very messy. We could not have made a very good impression on the
                    German populace in that town.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>We got up to what was to be our camp just about evening on Christmas Day. It was
                    dusk, and there was food waiting for us. There were some wooden barrels with
                    boiled potatoes with the jackets on and some bread and they came with some soup.
                    So we thought, hey, this is not bad. Some of the potatoes were not even
                    finished, sitting in the bottom of the barrel. Beginning the next day we found
                    that what we had had was a whole day's food, usually not potatoes anymore. Just
                    the soup and the bread. In the mornings we had a cup each of what I guess you'd
                    have to call herbal tea made from various berries and roots and things; for
                    mid-day we had a cup of soup each that rarely had any meat in it. Some dried
                    vegetables, some broth. In the evening, a loaf of bread to be divided among
                    seven men; a small loaf of very heavy, dark bread. Never any utensils provided.
                    Most of us had our canteens that came with a cup in the Army, so we got our tea
                    in the cup. I still had my steel helmet, although it had a hole in it from when
                    we were being shelled on the first day of the battle. I hit the ground and my
                    helmet flew a few feet ahead of me. When I crawled forward to retrieve it and
                    put it back on my head, it had a hole in it. Shrapnel had gone through the steel
                    helmet. But I was happy to put it back on my head anyhow. In prison camp this
                    became the vessel out of which I had my soup every day. Most of us still had the
                    canteen kit that had a knife, fork and spoon all hung together on a little loop.
                    Although the knife was not really sharp, it was good enough to cut the loaf of
                    bread into seven pieces. We very quickly worked out this system where the man
                    who did the cutting was the last one to choose his slice of bread, and the one
                    who had been last the night before became first the next day and you worked your
                    way around. When it was your turn to cut you cut it as evenly as you could
                    because otherwise that last piece would be much smaller than you wanted. We
                    spread the 7 pieces around and the first man would study them, trying to see
                    which was the largest piece. Everyone else would be saying “hurry up, hurry up,”
                    because they wanted to get their piece. Then the second man would go through
                    this and the third and fourth and so on down the line. That turned out to be our
                    whole diet. The tubs full of boiled potatoes were a Christmas treat, not part of
                    the daily routine.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>The main purpose of this first camp was processing and interrogation. Get your
                    name, rank and serial number and as much else as they could get out of you about
                    your military training. The kinds of things they were interested in was how old
                    we were, how long we had been in the army, how much training we had had, what
                    kind of weapons had we been trained on, what new weapons coming along, if we
                    knew anything about that. They would take us out to a building where the
                    interrogations would take place, a single story wooden building, long and narrow
                    with several doors on one side of it. They would break us up into groups of 20
                    or so in front of each door, and one person would go in at a time. Inside each
                    door was a German sitting at a table with forms to be filled in. They'd ask all
                    these questions, and if you didn't answer all of them, to their satisfaction you
                    went back to the end of the line again. It was pretty cold and miserable, so
                    you'd go through that a few times, back to the end of the line, then finally you
                    were ready to tell him what he wanted to know. It could only have been of use to
                    the Germans in putting together an estimate of how badly off we were and whether
                    we were scraping the barrel and taking people that were previously not
                    considered fit for combat, or taking people with little or no training. Some
                    kind of a strategic assessment was about all that they could get out of it.</p>
                <p>We had triple-deck bunks in the barracks. We slept two in a bunk. They had little
                    burlap bags stuffed with straw for mattresses. Each bunk had wooden slats across
                    the bottom on which the mattresses rested. In some barracks there were not even
                    enough bunks for two to a bunk, so some slept on the floor. The latrine was a
                    large hole in the ground a few yards away from the barracks. But the barracks
                    were locked when dark was descending so you couldn't go out to the latrine
                    during the night. There was a little vestibule just inside the door to each
                    barracks that sort of by mutual agreement was used as the night latrine. But
                    then you had to clean up the mess the next morning when the barracks were
                    opened.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>During the interrogation that went on for a couple of weeks, the Germans
                    separated the Jews from other prisoners. Religion was one of the questions and
                    they looked on your dog tags. If you had “H” on your dog tag that meant you were
                    Jewish. Some Jews, either not terribly orthodox or fearing what would happen to
                    them if they got behind German lines, didn't have H on their dog tags. But if
                    the Germans decided they had a Jewish name or looked Jewish, they were put in a
                    separate barracks with those who were clearly identified as Jews. They also
                    divided us by ranks. They put the officers in different barracks from the
                    noncoms, and the privates in a third group and the Jews became the fourth group.
                    We were told by one of our senior officers who tried to protest to the Germans
                    about this, the reply was: “Oh, we thought we were doing you a favor. We didn't
                    think you'd want to be in the same barracks with these Jews.” Which I guess was
                    standard Nazi line in those days. The officers were sent off after about three
                    weeks to an officer's camp. A week later the noncommissioned officers were sent
                    to another camp, including me. And the privates and Jews were left at this
                    original camp. I found out only a few weeks ago that then the Jews and others
                    the Germans considered trouble makers were sent to another place that turned out
                    to be a sub-camp of Buchenwald. It was the only known instance, as far as any of
                    us is aware, that American POWs who happened to be Jewish were treated
                    differently than other POWs. They were put in a camp where they worked alongside
                    Hungarian, Romanian, Polish Jews, whatever, and when they were too weak to work
                    anymore, they were shot, just the same as happened in concentration camps. There
                    were all together about 350 U.S. POWs who went to this camp, which was called
                    Bergen-Belsen-an-Elster in eastern Germany, near the Czech border. Only about
                    half of them survived.</p>
                <p>A lot of people in the regular POW camps died from the diet. After we got to the
                    noncommissioned officers camp, an American doctor was sent from one of the
                    officers camps to be our medical person. Because he was an officer, he also
                    became our senior representative. At this camp we had this same diet of herbal
                    tea, soup and bread. The doctor estimated that it supplied perhaps 900 calories
                    a day, which would not sustain life for very long even just sitting doing
                    nothing, as we did. Depending on individual metabolism rates, people would begin
                    to fade away. Sure enough, after a couple of weeks the first guy died, then a
                    few days later another one and the following day, two. There were 1,200 non-coms
                    who went to this particular camp, which turned out to be 9-A, in a little place
                    called Ziegenhain just south of Kassel. When we were liberated at the end of
                    March, we were down to 1,000. We had lost about 200 people from malnutrition.
                    But the Jews at Bergen-Belsen had much higher casualties, losing about 50% by
                    the time they were liberated. When this came to our attention for the first
                    time, about four or five years ago, we started publicizing it a bit in our
                    Division Association magazine and some scholars got on to it. The first one I
                    was aware of was a guy named Michell Bard, who then got in touch with us and
                    asked if people who had had this experience would communicate with him, which
                    they did. He has written a book on this subject which is being published next
                    week, finally. Since he began his research, two other people have contacted us
                    and asked for cooperation from people in our Division who went through this
                    experience, so I think there will be a little more publicity about it now.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I was fortunate to be in the first camp to be liberated since we were right in
                    the line of the U.S. forces when they broke out of the Remagen bridgehead.
                    Ziegenhain was right on the Sieg River, which empties into the Rhine at Remagen.
                    They just came right on up the valley, and there we were. We were liberated
                    already on the 30th of March, six weeks or so before the war was over, and we
                    were back in this country before the German surrender. We were given initially
                    30 days R&amp;R to recuperate from the experience. I got back home to Rock
                    Island by May 2 or 3, went down to the radio station where I had worked and went
                    back to work immediately. Although I was still in the Army, on leave, they
                    needed people and that 30 day leave was extended to 60 and then to 90, so I had
                    90 days furlough and worked back in my radio announcing mode the whole time.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Back in the Army again, I finally had a physical examination. Some of the ex-POWs
                    were found fit for further combat duty and were sent out to divisions preparing
                    to invade Japan, which fortunately they never had to do, thanks to the atom
                    bomb. But this physical examination found that I was not quite ready for combat,
                    so I was assigned to the armed forces radio service. I worked as an announcer at
                    an AFRS station at Percy Jones General Hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan. When
                    the war was over both in Europe and Japan, I was discharged in November of 1945,
                    just a day before Thanksgiving. Went back home, resumed my radio announcing,
                    intending to do it forever. With the G.I. bill available, I decided I'd also go
                    to college. The Army had given me one term at the University of Wisconsin. I
                    wanted to stay at home and continue to work at the radio station, so I enrolled
                    at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, a month after I got out of the
                    Army, but continued to work 39 hours a week at the radio station on the night
                    shift and went to school full time during the day, including summers. I was able
                    to graduate in three years. During that time I became more interested in my
                    studies and less interested in a radio career, and my last summer at Augustana I
                    was offered a scholarship to attend the Institute of World Affairs in Twin
                    Lakes, Connecticut: 32 students, 16 American, 16 foreign, brought together for a
                    summer. All of the foreigners were graduate students and many of the Americans
                    were too. I still had one semester to go at Augustana. I decided from that
                    experience that if I were to stand any chance of getting into the American
                    Foreign Service I needed to go to graduate school. I had gotten some literature
                    from the Department of State that suggested the majority of people who passed
                    the FSO examination had some graduate training, and that the majority of those
                    entering the Foreign Service had graduate degrees. Some of the textbooks I had
                    used for international relations and political science were written by
                    professors at the University of Wisconsin, some by professors at Stanford. I
                    applied to both and was accepted by both for the graduate program; but Stanford
                    would only take people in the fall, and I was finishing Augustana in mid-year. I
                    decided I'd go back to Wisconsin until the fall and then go out to Stanford. By
                    the time the fall came I was so comfortable back at the University of Wisconsin
                    that I just stayed there and got my master's degree in political science. I did
                    a lot of work in the history department too, in Russian and Balkan history.
                    Wrote my master's thesis on U.S.-Albanian relations, which came about because of
                    a man from Rock Island that I had become very friendly with at Augustana
                    College. We were in many of the same classes at Augustana, and I found out that
                    he had been in OSS in Albania during the war. He had been a very keen amateur
                    radio operator and got a high grade on the signal corps aptitude test when he
                    went into the Army. Somehow, he got into OSS. All the rest of the people in the
                    OSS mission in Albania were either Albanian-born or born in the U.S. of Albanian
                    parents and spoke the language.He was the only non-Albanian in this OSS Mission
                    and was radio operator for the group. Their mission was to try to get the
                    partisans to fight the Germans, which according to him was a very difficult
                    thing because they were more interested in fighting each other. You had the
                    Communist-led partisan group that our OSS Mission was attached to, and you had a
                    royalist underground group that the British Mission was attached to. Both the
                    American and British Missions spent more time trying to get their respective
                    groups not to fight each other but to fight the Germans. But they were obviously
                    more interested in trying to get the upper hand for running the country after
                    the war, and in fact, as history proved, it was the Communist group that had the
                    inside track. After the Germans left, the State Department reopened its mission
                    in Tirana. My friend was invited to stay on as the State Department Mission
                    communicator, so he went across the Adriatic to Bari to be discharged from the
                    Army and sworn into the Foreign Service and went back to Tirana as the Legation
                    communicator. After about a year of that, he decided that the Foreign Service
                    was a nice thing, but he didn't want to be a communicator all his life. He
                    wanted to go back to college and become a Foreign Service officer, so he
                    resigned and went back to Augustana. His stories about Foreign Service life in
                    Albania got me interested in the Foreign Service as well, and his experience in
                    Albania got me interested in that country. For a graduate course I took at
                    Augustana in historiography I needed to do a paper, and he had brought back some
                    documents with him, Albanian government handouts that he was happy to make
                    available to me so I did a paper on the OSS mission in Albania, the situation in
                    Albania at the end of the war. When I went back to Wisconsin to graduate school,
                    I expanded that into my thesis on the whole history of U.S.-Albanian relations
                    from the time the country was first established as a separate country in 1914,
                    after the Balkan wars when the Ottoman Empire was broken up in that area, to the
                    establishment of the monarchy in the 1920s with King Zog, the Italian
                    occupation, the German occupation and the rival communist-royalist missions, the
                    end of the war, the arrival of the State Department, the refusal of the Hoxha
                    communist government to accede to our conditions for establishment of full
                    diplomatic relations, the withdrawal of the State Department Mission in 1946. My
                    friend, Edward Nicholas, went to graduate school at Columbia, did his master's
                    thesis on Albanian economic geography while I was doing one on Albanian
                    relations with the U.S. We got together in Chicago in September of 1949 to take
                    the FSO written examination, which as you may remember in those days was three
                    or four-and-a-half days long. The half day was language exams and the other days
                    were everything else; general studies, history, economics, English
                    comprehension, quite a lot of writing, some multiple choice but a lot of
                    writing. At the end of each day we'd limp out of there to a restaurant and back
                    to a hotel and go to bed early because both of us felt as if we had been
                    intellectually drained at the end of that process. There was nothing more that
                    they could have asked us that we could have possibly answered. It was a very
                    exhaustive examination—an exhaustive experience too.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>We got the results in December, and to my surprise I passed the examination and
                    he didn't, he missed by just a few points. By that time I was one year into
                    graduate school at Wisconsin. Approximately a year later you'd have the oral
                    examination. If you passed, then the security clearance and the physical exam
                    and everything. You faced the prospect of two years on the waiting list for an
                    appointment as a Foreign Service officer. So I had plenty of time to finish my
                    Master's Degree work, which I did in June 1950. My major professor at Wisconsin
                    was Llewellen Pfankuchen, who was the only survivor of the group of professors
                    whose textbooks I had at Augustana. When I went up to Wisconsin I found that
                    most of them had left in the aftermath of the Joe McCarthy elections in
                    Wisconsin, because most of the faculty there had backed McCarthy's rival. When
                    McCarthy won and the University administration also became much more
                    conservative, many of these famous old professors left for jobs at Columbia and
                    Harvard and so on. Grayson Kirk, for example, John Gaus, all had been on the
                    political science faculty when it was in its heyday. They went Ivy League. But
                    Pfankuchen, I guess, had not been so involved in the party politics and he
                    survived. He invited me to stay on as his graduate assistant and go on for a
                    Ph.D., but by the time I got my Master's Degree I was sick and tired of school
                    and ready to get on with life and make a living, so I declined the opportunity
                    and came to Washington to take the oral examination and passed that as well.
                    Meantime, my friend Nicholas took a job as a management intern in the Department
                    of the Army at Rock Island Arsenal in our hometown. By the time he could take
                    the FSO written examination again, he had gotten several promotions in the civil
                    service, gotten married, so he never did reapply—the man who was probably
                    responsible for getting me into the Foreign Service never joined himself! He
                    shot up so fast in the Department of the Army civil service that he was a super
                    grader long before I got to the senior grades in the Foreign Service. But we
                    remained friends just the same.</p>
                <p>Facing this two year wait after passing the FSO examinations, I applied all over
                    the place for something to occupy me in the meantime, including a management
                    intern position in the State Department. I took that examination, which was an
                    oral group examination, passed that. I applied over in the Pentagon, because
                    they had a vacancy in the Balkan section of Air Force Intelligence, and I had
                    done the Balkan history work at Wisconsin and my thesis on Albania. They were
                    interested in hiring me but were in a temporary civil service hiring freeze. And
                    I applied at the CIA, and they said I'd hear from them eventually if they had a
                    need. But before any of these things could materialize, the State Department
                    offered me an FSS appointment for the Polish veterans displaced persons program
                    at the Embassy in London. I had been in England for a couple of months in the
                    Army, liked London very much, had had a three-day pass there just before we went
                    across the Channel to get involved in the Battle of the Bulge. I was very happy
                    to take this appointment in London as a vice-consul issuing visas to Poles who
                    had served under British command in the Second World War. It was a very
                    interesting experience and fit in also with my interest in Eastern Europe. When
                    Germany and the Soviet Union divided up Poland, the Russians were left with
                    about half a million Polish POWs. After Germany attacked the Soviets, the
                    British persuaded the Russians to release about a quarter million of these
                    Poles. The Russians took them down to Iran and the British took them over,
                    outfitted them, organized them into units, the largest of which was a corps
                    under General Ladislaw Anders. There were Polish ships in the Royal Navy, there
                    were Polish squadrons in the Royal Air Force, and there was a Polish Armored
                    Division as well. All these Poles had fought under British command. When the war
                    ended and the Communists wound up on top in Poland, many of these Poles did not
                    want to go back. A good many stayed in Great Britain, nearly 200,000 of them.
                    They were not eligible for American visas under the original displaced persons
                    act, which applied only on the continent of Europe, not in the British Isles.
                    But the Polish community in the United States lobbied Congress efficiently. In
                    1950 they passed an amendment to the displaced persons act to provide for 15,000
                    visas for these Poles in Britain, and the Department recruited three people who
                    were on the FSO waiting list to go over and administer this program. I was one
                    of those. Since we were new to the Foreign Service, London gave us two
                    experienced officers, and I was the third officer in that unit. One of the other
                    new fellows, Dick Adams, was put in the regular visa section, and the other new
                    man, Walt McClelland, was transferred to Liverpool shortly after we arrived in
                    England.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The program was originally to be one year duration, but by that time most of the
                    Poles were so settled in Britain that they didn't come forward very rapidly to
                    use up the 15,000 visas that we were authorized to issue. We advertised in the
                    newspapers in Britain, the only time I'm aware of when the United States
                    advertised for people to apply for immigrant visas to come live in the United
                    States! But we advertised in the British and the Polish language newspapers, and
                    we worked through all the Polish organizations in Britain, of which there were
                    several, to promote the program. When the year elapsed, we hadn't even issued
                    10,000, so it was extended another six months. By the time the program lapsed
                    after 18 months, we had issued about 12,000 visas. By that time, too, my FSO
                    appointment had come through, much sooner than expected, in March of '51
                    already, after entering as a staff officer in July of 1950.They had originally
                    said that when the FSO appointment came, I'd go back to the United States, go
                    through the regular officer course at FSI and all that, but since I was already
                    abroad that never happened. They just sent me new papers, new rank, new
                    commission, new position and just continue to do what I was doing. So I never
                    did come back to take the basic officer course or any other course at FSI. I
                    never had a course of training at the Foreign Service Institute, which I
                    regretted because years later one of my jobs in the Foreign Service was chief of
                    the training assignments branch, responsible for assigning people to the Foreign
                    Service Institute, never having taken a course there myself.</p>
                <p>When the Polish veterans program expired in December of '51, I was sent up to the
                    consulate in Newcastle in January of '52. I had done a final report on the
                    program, what we did, how it had been set up, what problems we had had, what we
                    had done with it and what the final results were. It was the first Foreign
                    Service despatch that I had ever done, this sort of history of the Polish
                    veterans program, for the record, and then went up to Newcastle, which was a
                    two-man consulate. In those days we still had about ten consulates spread around
                    the British Isles. The fellow who had entered with me, Dick Adams, who had been
                    in the regular visa section, was sent to Bradford. We'd had one man in the
                    program in Glasgow, who issued visas, otherwise London issued them for the rest
                    of the U.K., that was Toby Belcher, who later became identified with Cyprus,
                    became ambassador to Cyprus. I went then to Newcastle, having done only Polish
                    veterans displaced persons visas in London, and of course there was nothing of
                    that in Newcastle. We had non-immigrant visas and commercial invoices, because
                    in those days every export to the United States had to be accompanied by a
                    consular commercial invoice. Those were the two main pieces of work in
                    Newcastle. We had three British ladies. One did the visas, one did the
                    commercial invoices, and one did the general administration there. A week after
                    I arrived in Newcastle the principal officer, Harold Pease, went on home leave,
                    leaving me alone in a post when I had only been in this one very specialized
                    duty in London, at a time when London was the largest post we had in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Our NATO mission was still in London, we still had a large AID mission there, so
                    we had I think three people with the title Ambassador and three people with the
                    title Minister and pages and pages of American Foreign Service people there. In
                    those days the Foreign Service list was arranged by rank, and within rank,
                    alphabetically for each post. Since I was the lowest grade officer there was and
                    my name began with S, it was the last name in six pages of the Foreign Service
                    list for London. But suddenly I was in Newcastle and after one week I was the
                    U.S. representative. Having been totally anonymous in London, I was photographed
                    and interviewed by all the newspapers in Newcastle—new vice-consul in Newcastle.
                    I got there shortly before the Lord Lieutenant's annual banquet for the
                    Newcastle consular corps, which was sizeable, mostly honorary people, and this
                    was a white-tie and decorations affair. My boss, Harold Pease, told me that I'd
                    have a lot of use for white tie in Newcastle, it's a very formal society, you'll
                    be invited to dinner a lot. If the invitation says nothing about dress it's
                    understood that it's black tie, “smoking;” if it's anything special it'll be
                    white tie. It'll pay you to have your own set of tails. So I went to a local
                    tailor and he rushed out a set of tails for me for the Lord Lieutenant's annual
                    banquet, which took place only about ten days after I got there, a few days
                    after the principal officer left. Fortunately, on the day of the banquet I was
                    out in the street and ran into the Portuguese consul general, mentioned to him
                    how my wife and I were looking forward to this affair that evening, our first
                    big gathering in Newcastle. He looked at me, very surprised, and said, “Oh, the
                    ladies are not invited.” It hadn't even occurred to me that a white tie affair
                    would be for men only, so I rushed back to the office, called my wife, and said,
                    “You don't have to worry about your dress for tonight. I'm going alone.” And
                    there we were, all the local gentlemen, dignitaries, all in white tie and
                    decorations, a very, very formal sort of stilted affair. Later that year the
                    Lord Mayor gave his annual banquet for the consular corps, and for the first
                    time in history they decided to invite the spouses as well. So the ladies went
                    to that one. Those were the two big affairs every year in Newcastle. During the
                    Lord Mayor's banquet so many remarks were made about how this was an experiment,
                    to have the ladies there, and it seemed to be going rather well and maybe they
                    would try it again the following year; if nothing untoward happened during the
                    rest of the evening, it might be considered a success and they'd try it
                    again!</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>But it was a great experience for me to be alone in Newcastle and do what had to
                    be done, which was not an awful lot. I had time to get out and meet local
                    politicians. In London one of the few friends I had made outside of the visa
                    section was the labor attach�, because by chance he and my mother had gone to
                    high school together. He had gone into the railway clerks union and become, I
                    think, executive vice president, and had gotten a one-time Foreign Service
                    reserve appointment as labor attach� in London. My mother had somehow kept track
                    of this man, and when I got to London she said, “Oh, you must look up my old
                    high school friend Glenn Atkinson.” I did, and through him I met many of the
                    British union contacts of his. When I was transferred to Newcastle he informed
                    some of his union friends that I was coming, so I was well treated by the union
                    people in Newcastle, who also happened to be Labor Party officials. One of them,
                    who was on the executive committee of the northeast Labor Party, invited me to
                    attend their annual party gathering, from which the non-Labor press was
                    excluded. He gave me a set of delegate's credentials. I was nervous. This was
                    the first foreign political gathering I had ever been to. I kept my mouth shut
                    so that people wouldn't realize I was an American. My host knew, of course, and
                    he explained things to me as it went on, but I didn't try to talk to other
                    people. I spent the whole day there, and when I got back to the house that
                    evening I dictated my first ever political report—to my wife—and sent it in. I
                    got a commendation from the British desk in the Department because it was the
                    first account they had had of how Party leader Hugh Gaitskell explained the loss
                    of the General Elections two months earlier to an audience of party faithful. I
                    also got a letter of reprimand from the political counselor in London (to whom I
                    had sent a copy of my report) because he said that, since foreign government
                    representatives were not invited to this convention, I was exposing the U.S.
                    government to embarrassment by attending. My report had specified that I was the
                    only foreigner there. I should have just not mentioned that, not bragged about
                    it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Labor movement in Newcastle? Were
                        they sort of militantly left-wing communist, or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: There were some. But the people that Glenn had referred me to were
                    certainly not in that category, including Sam Watson of the Miners Union and
                    Lord Westwood of General &amp; Municipal Workers. They were the moderate wing of
                    the Party, which still dominated in those days. The militant left-wing, which
                    was very communist influenced was small by comparison.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I want to tell you about my wife. On the ship going over to England, which was
                    the Queen Elizabeth, there was a new Foreign Service secretary as well as we
                    three new FSS vice consuls. After we got to London, I dated this girl once or
                    twice. In March of '51, after we had been there seven months or so, she gave a
                    cocktail party, and there I met another girl who was a secretary in the
                    political section. I took her out after the cocktail party and began to date her
                    regularly. After about six weeks I proposed to her and she accepted. When my
                    transfer to Newcastle came through eight months later, we decided to get
                    married. In those days she had to resign from the Foreign Service. A woman
                    couldn't be married and remain in the Foreign Service. Her Foreign Service
                    career was confined to London and then accompanying me the rest of the time.
                    Thus, I had in my house in Newcastle a wife who until the month before had been
                    a Foreign Service secretary. When I got home from the Labor Party convention,
                    she was already in bed, so I got in bed alongside her and dictated my first
                    Foreign Service report to my bride of only a few days. We were married January
                    26, 1952. I came back from Newcastle after two weeks for the wedding in London.
                    That was an unusual experience.</p>
                <p>Since the principal officer was going on home leave two days after the wedding,
                    he invited us to stay in the government residence. From being the anonymous,
                    most junior officer in London I was not only temporarily the government
                    representative in Newcastle, but we were in this magnificent government
                    residence which had goodness knows how many bedrooms, servants, a tennis court
                    in the backyard, a government car in the garage. No chauffeur, I had to drive it
                    myself. I made use of it to tour the consular district during the four and a
                    half months the principal officer was gone, leaving me in charge.
                    Northumberland, the North Riding of Yorkshire, Cumberland, Westmoreland and
                    Durham were in my district, including the Lake District and Hadrian's Wall, the
                    old Roman Wall across northern England. It was really a very nice life, a nice
                    honeymoon too in this lovely home. When the principal officer came back, we
                    moved into a very modest apartment down in Tynemouth, overlooking the North Sea.
                    I took the train back and forth to work every day, about 20 minutes in each
                    direction. Life was a lot quieter after the principal officer came back. He was
                    happy to have me do what little political and economic reporting I could
                    generate there.</p>
                <p>After nine months I was transferred to Bologna, which was a USIS sub-post of the
                    consulate in Florence. I was assigned to Florence but resident in Bologna. I had
                    home leave and transferred there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, I've got you in Bologna from about 1952...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SULSER: We got there in January of '53 and it closed in October of '53. When I
                    got the assignment, I went to a local bookstore in Newcastle and bought a book
                    on “Teach Yourself Italian,” and my wife and I spent hours with that book during
                    home leave. When I got to Bologna I found that the Public Affairs officer had
                    asked the Department to assign an Italian-speaking newspaperman. Of course I
                    didn't speak Italian. The radio station in Rock Island was owned by a newspaper,
                    and I had read the news written by somebody else on the radio, but I could not
                    be described as a newspaperman! But he swallowed his disappointment and we hired
                    a teacher from the local Berlitz School at our own expense who came to us for an
                    hour every day to learn Italian. I had a local staff of 21 people, only two of
                    whom could converse much in English, so here I was trying to learn Italian,
                    trying to supervise a staff that was largely non-English-speaking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the staff doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I was the Information Officer, and my side of the staff was distributing
                    material to newspapers from the wireless file, things of that sort, hoping they
                    would publish it. Trying to make contact with editors, and so on, get them to
                    use information we could supply them. But most of my staff was distributing
                    unattributed anti-communist pamphlets that we were publishing there in Italy
                    without attribution to the United States government, leading up to the 1953
                    Parliamentary elections. We were trying to weaken the communists in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of the Red Belt, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>SULSER: Indeed! There were about 200 communes in our area, and nearly all had
                    communist majorities on their elected councils. The mayor of Bologna was Luigi
                    Longo, who was then the deputy head and became the head of the Italian Communist
                    Party. We had several people who were bundling these unattributed pamphlets and
                    delivering them or sending them out to churches, non-communist trade unions,
                    things of that sort, who would pass them around. We also had a mobile film unit
                    that showed anti-communist films out in the sticks. The PAO decided it would be
                    good for my Italian to go out with one of these mobile film units for about two
                    weeks. We had the driver and the projectionist, neither of whom could speak
                    English, and I went out with them for two weeks, driving from one little hamlet
                    to another putting up posters of the movies we were going to be showing that
                    night, usually in the village square, projecting them against the side of a
                    building. These guys were just ordinary fellows, but as the stereotype of the
                    Italian goes, everybody goes around singing opera all the time; and in fact
                    these guys were opera fans. They had opera records and a record player in the
                    truck and loudspeakers, and we'd play opera records for an hour before we'd show
                    the films. In those days USIS was bragging about how many people would come up
                    after such film shows and turn in their communist party cards, and that sort of
                    thing. We were sending in monthly reports, “evidence of effectiveness,” how many
                    communist party cards had been turned into us as a result of our propaganda
                    activities.</p>
                <p>The other part of the Bologna operation was a library, a beautiful library in an
                    historic palazzo. When Eisenhower and Dulles took over in 1953, they started
                    closing posts all over the world. They decided to close this information center
                    in Bologna just after we'd spent over a quarter of a million dollars
                    refurbishing the library. We got permission to keep the library open after the
                    post had closed in October 1953. Two or three of the Italian library staff were
                    retained. In 1955, when Johns Hopkins opened their Bologna center of the School
                    of Advanced International Studies, they took over the library and our old staff
                    there. So I had about nine months in Bologna, cramming Italian, learning Italian
                    food as well as the language. While the Italian language was not retained very
                    well, the interest in la cucina italiana certainly was...particularly la cucina
                    Bolognesa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any people turn in their communist party
                        badges during the time you were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The two weeks I went out with the film unit, No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me it sounds very improbable that people would make
                        that gesture. It sounds like one of those hyperbole jobs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SULSER: When the post was closed, the film library and the mobile unit were
                    turned over to the Italian government. The last thing I did was, again, a sort
                    of wrap-up political report about the election results in our district, trying
                    to show that in those places where we had operated either the film or the
                    unattributed pamphlets on our behalf by Italian organizations that we'd had some
                    impact on the election results. Clare Boothe Luce was ambassador at that time,
                    and she came up to Bologna twice while I was there. The last time was for the
                    formal rededication of our refurbished library. The Cardinal resident in
                    Bologna, Cardinal Lercaro, who was known as the Cardinale dei Bambini, for his
                    record with children when he was Cardinal in Genoa, where he was reputed to have
                    had an impact on the communists. The church moved him to Bologna so he could
                    work on the communists in the Red Belt there. He and Ambassador Luce and Mayor
                    Luigi Longo, of communist party fame, got along famously at our reception. The
                    three of them sat together and had a very earnest conversation in one corner the
                    whole evening long. I can't say we had an awful lot of impact on the communists
                    there. When I was assigned there, USIS was still part of the State Department.
                    In August of '53 USIA was separated from State, and I was seconded to USIA for
                    the balance of that assignment, which proved to be only a couple of months. When
                    the post closed, I was transferred to Duesseldorf to start what proved to be the
                    major emphasis of my career—Central Europe.</p>
                <p>I went to Duesseldorf in October of '53, spent about six months doing
                    nonimmigrant visas, about six months doing passport and citizenship and then
                    became a political officer. I spent three years as the political officer. The
                    consular district consisted of the province of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is
                    the largest in population, the most influential politically, the richest
                    province economically and industrially in the Federal Republic. It was a good
                    place to be. It was Adenauer's center, it was the center of the labor party of
                    the CDU, it was one of the strongholds of the FDP, the Free Democratic Party. It
                    was also a major center of the Social Democratic Party. I had an opportunity to
                    get acquainted with leading politicians of all three of those parties in
                    Germany. People from all three later became very prominent on the national
                    level. Rainer Barzel, who was one of my contacts, later became head of the CDU.
                    Wolfgang Doering was the executive secretary of the FDP, later became their
                    faction leader in the Bundestag and many others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any problem having been a prisoner of the
                        Germans to end up back in Germany? Did this take a little adjustment on your
                        part, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I never felt that it required any adjustment. I never really associated
                    what happened to me in prison camp, the 55 pounds I lost, the couple of hundred
                    people who died, the occasional brutal guard who would come into a barracks and
                    knock the precious cup of soup out of a prisoner's hand, had anything much to do
                    with the Germans I was dealing with, most of whom had been in the German army,
                    navy or air force themselves. A few had been POWs in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>One of the contacts I had there had been in prison camp in Minnesota, and had
                    taken the opportunity to take correspondence courses from the University of
                    Minnesota and had been there long enough to get a degree! We were not offered
                    any opportunities like that the short time I was a POW, although we had a
                    lecture program, trying to occupy our time. Anybody who had anything they were
                    willing to talk about, we'd post a schedule every day. The most popular lectures
                    were about food. We had a Chinaman who had been a cook in a Chinese restaurant.
                    He educated us on Chinese food. We had a fellow who had worked in the Hershey
                    candy factory, so he told us about how chocolate bars and hand-dipped chocolates
                    were made. Those were popular lectures. Another guy who had raised rabbits
                    commercially for food was very popular. Anyway, no, I never felt that I had any
                    great problem. I met a few Germans who had been in the Nazi Party, or even in
                    the Waffen SS, things of that sort. I was less friendly with them and they were
                    less friendly with me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about the organization. You did
                        visa and passport work first. Were there any particular problems with doing
                        this or were you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The system throughout Germany then, before you issued anybody a visa,
                    businessmen or anyone else, you had to get clearances from CIC in Stuttgart and
                    from the Berlin Documents Center that had the old Nazi Party records. This often
                    took weeks, sometimes months before you could issue a visa. We rarely got
                    anything from either of those sources that was a problem as far as issuing the
                    visa. I did a study, how many thousands of visas and how few of them were
                    affected by anything we got from the CIC or the Document Center. While we were
                    trying to help the German economy to recover, trying to promote German exports
                    to the United States, to eliminate the dollar gap, we were impeding our own
                    programs by delaying these visas. When we had no reason to believe after
                    reviewing the application that there would be a problem, we should be able to
                    issue the visa and not have to wait for the clearances. The Department approved
                    that. That was, I guess, the first initiative I took in the Foreign Service that
                    changed the way things were done. Much to the pleasure of all the other posts in
                    Germany, the Department authorized us to get these clearances on an
                    ex-post-facto basis and if we found something prejudicial in due course we would
                    then revoke the visa, but in the meantime 99.9% of the visas were issued with no
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A little bit later, around '56 or so or '57, I was a
                        passport officer in Frankfurt and we had a lot of problems with people born
                        in Germany, who went to the United States, returned to Germany right after
                        the war, were American citizens but wanted to stay in Germany. Yet the rules
                        were that if they stayed more than three years they could lose their
                        citizenship. So there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing to get the people to
                        return and they wouldn't, but they didn't want to lose their
                        citizenship.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, although they were protected as long as they were employed abroad by
                    the U.S. government or an American business company, as many were. There would
                    be problems like that in Frankfurt, which was more of an American center in
                    Germany after the war. I was later in Frankfurt and I saw the difference there.
                    There were not so many Americans in Duesseldorf, which was the headquarters of
                    the British occupation zone. We did have some problems of Germans who had had
                    children in the U.S. before, returning to Germany. Citizenship laws are a very,
                    very complicated business, and I never really did it long enough to get familiar
                    with all the ins and outs beyond knowing that there were those problems. We, of
                    course, had to refer a lot of cases to the Department for rulings. We had a few
                    American women acquiring German citizenship by marriage, and their use of
                    American passports was restricted. We generally kept their passports in the
                    consulate and we let them use them for purposes of traveling to the States, but
                    if they were going, say, to Dubrovnik with their husband for a holiday, they'd
                    go on a German passport.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The majority of your work was within the German political
                        system, was that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes. Three of my four years in Duesseldorf I was the political officer
                    and went to all the annual conventions of those three parties, hung out a lot at
                    the Landtag, the State Legislature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said this was CDU...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The Minister-President, Karl Arnold, was CDU in a coalition with the FDP,
                    as they were at the national level too. The North Rhine-Westphalia FDP was the
                    strongest in the party at that time, and although they had no complaint against
                    Arnold, who headed the labor wing of the CDU, they were very unhappy with the
                    way Adenauer was treating them on the national level. They broke the coalition
                    in Duesseldorf in order to warn the CDU nationally and formed a new government
                    with the SPD. This was the only time during my years there that Duesseldorf
                    politics got not only national, but international attention. The whole foreign
                    press corps from Bonn came up to Duesseldorf for the critical debates at the
                    Landtag and the final decisions ending that coalition and establishing the new
                    one. Many of the American journalists came to see me as the person who could
                    fill them in on the background: why was the FDP doing this and were these a
                    bunch of neo-Nazis, etc. This was my first exposure to foreign correspondents,
                    and I was disappointed. Of all the American journalists I dealt with in 25 years
                    in Europe, there were very few who seemed to me to be as well informed as the
                    Foreign Service reporting officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting anything from Bonn and your Consul
                        General about how we viewed the three parties that were, I'm sure the KPD
                        was even on the...we didn't even think anything of them, that was the
                        Communist Party, but how about the SPD? Were we somewhat aloof from them, or
                        how did we feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I never got any guidance one way or the other as to how to view these
                    parties, but it was certainly the view of the American newspapermen who came up
                    to Duesseldorf that this was a very nasty thing the FDP was doing. My friends in
                    the FDP insisted they were not taking the country in any great radical
                    direction, and I couldn't see that they were. The SPD formed the new coalition
                    with North Rhine-Westphalia and was a very moderate party. The FDP people kept
                    me very well informed; not only were they very accessible to me but whenever
                    anything very special was going on they would come to me to make sure that I
                    understood what they were doing. To some extent I guess I was their man in the
                    U.S. government to try and keep the Embassy and Washington informed of at least
                    what they thought they were doing, what their intentions were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the SPD? Did you have many connections with them
                        or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I did, yes. Fritz Steinhof, who became the Minister-President in this
                    first-ever coalition of that kind in North Rhine - Westphalia, and many others.
                    All three of the parties would invite me to their meetings and even to their
                    homes, and I became friendly with their families. It was an unusual opportunity
                    for me, because this was really the area of interest that got me in the Foreign
                    Service in the first place. My experience in the war, POW camp. It was curiosity
                    about Europeans in general and Germans in particular, and here was an
                    opportunity to see what these people were made of, so to speak, who they were,
                    what they were like, and I enjoyed every bit of it.</p>
                <p>We had a local assistant in the political section, a man named Egenolf von
                    Bergheim, who had been a captain in the German army. At one stage he had been
                    aide to Hasso Von Manteuffel when Von Manteuffel was the commandant of the
                    armored school. It was Von Manteuffel who commanded the 5th Panzer Army that
                    beat up the division I was in in the Battle of the Bulge. Von Manteuffel was
                    then an FDP Bundestag deputy living in our consular district, in fact across the
                    river, in Neuss. Our local assistant arranged for Von Manteuffel to come to the
                    Consulate one day to spend the day with me going over very detailed maps of the
                    Bulge area, describing where he was at every moment and where I was at every
                    moment. I never had an opportunity to discuss the Battle with a lower ranking
                    American general, but here I was talking to one of the top German generals
                    because of my Foreign Service position. Of the three armies on the German side
                    in the Battle of the Bulge, his was the most successful, making the deepest
                    penetration to the Meuse River.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>As far as attitude of the Embassy, they always seemed very interested in the
                    information I gave them, but guidance, reaction was minimal to nonexistent as to
                    what I should be trying to do or what my attitude should be toward these
                    individuals or parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view the Germans and rearmament? This was a
                        period of building up NATO. Were we concerned or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: We were keen to have it. In fact, one of our principal objectives in
                    establishing NATO and bringing about the Bonn accords and the end of the
                    occupation was to get the Germans to re-establish an army and put some strength
                    in the NATO side. The other member countries of NATO were not doing as much as
                    we thought was necessary. They thought they were doing as much as they could,
                    since their economies were still recovering from the war. From the beginning the
                    U.S. saw German entrance in NATO and German rearmament as the main source of
                    additional conventional strength to offset the Soviets and other Warsaw Pact
                    countries. Of course, when I went to Duesseldorf in 1953 it was still the
                    occupation and there was no German army. But there was the Buero Blank that had
                    been set up with our blessing, a kind of would-be defense ministry to do some of
                    the initial planning. The Embassy had the principle contact with Theo Blank; he
                    was from the trade union sector of the CDU in Duesseldorf, so we had some
                    contact with him as well and some of the other people in his office, including
                    the former German officers who were setting up the screening criteria for the
                    new Bundeswehr, to replace the Wehrmacht.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the British? The British military was in your
                        area, wasn't it? The British Army of the Rhine? For obvious reasons the
                        British didn't seem to forgive and forget as easily as we did. Did you find
                        the British sort of uneasy allies in that area? Did you notice that or
                        not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SULSER: They were not as enthusiastic as the United States was, that's for sure,
                    but they were not nearly as reluctant as the French. The French were also more
                    reluctant in rebuilding German industry. We had the Ruhr Authority in
                    Duesseldorf when I went there in '53, which was sort of a precursor of the coal
                    and steel community, in which the British and French were represented as well as
                    the U.S. They were not nearly as keen as we were to get the German steel
                    industry revived and end the reparations and the looting of the German factories
                    on behalf of the Soviets and the other East Europeans. The British army was much
                    less apparent in Duesseldorf than was the American Army in the Frankfurt area.
                    We'd go down to Frankfurt for shopping and the PX and hospital and things of
                    that sort. You felt much more like you were surrounded by Americans in Frankfurt
                    than you ever felt in the presence of the British in Duesseldorf. Their numbers
                    were a good deal fewer than the Americans. At my level this was not a problem.
                    The political officer in the British consulate did pretty much what I did. We
                    went to the same parties and political gatherings. The French political officer
                    didn't get around to all those German political affairs nearly as much as the
                    British fellow and I did. The British political officer had been in the area
                    since 1945. He knew his way around much better than I did at first. He was kind
                    of a guide to me.</p>
                <p>With '55 came the end of the occupation and the restoration of a larger share of
                    German sovereignty, although it still had some limitations on it. All the houses
                    that the Duesseldorf Consulate staff lived in had originally been requisitioned
                    by the British military and then made available to us when the consulate was
                    established there in '51. There were still many of the original people that
                    opened the post when I went there in '53, but quite a few had left already by
                    that time. When the occupation ended, the Embassy had to negotiate leases with
                    the German owners of these quarters. We built our own office, because the
                    Consulate was in what had been the residence of the chief justice of the state
                    court. The courtroom and offices were across the street. We put up a building of
                    our own just next door and gave the office back to the court. They cut it in
                    two—put the chief justice in the back half, overlooking the garden and the front
                    half became offices for his staff. We had our own U.S.-designed building, which
                    we still have, although the Duesseldorf Consulate closed about 25 years later.
                    As I was closing Bologna a year after I left Newcastle, that consulate was
                    closed. My last overseas post in Rotterdam was closed four years after I left
                    there. The only posts I served in that still exist are London, Vienna, and
                    Frankfurt. (Since taping this interview, Duesseldorf has reopened as a limited
                    commercial post and is expected to become a full-fledged consulate again when
                    the Embassy moves from Bonn to Berlin. The office building has been leased to
                    Mannesmann Co. for some years but may be recovered when the lease expires.)</p>

                        interview. Jack, you said you thought of a few more things about
                        Duesseldorf?</hi>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SULSER: Reflecting on our conversation of last week, I don't think I gave you a
                    very good answer to your question about what the Free Democratic Party, the FDP,
                    was up to when it broke the coalition in North Rhine - Westphalia with the CDU
                    and formed a new one with the Social Democratic Party. I think it was because
                    the Young Turks in the North Rhine - Westphalia FDP felt very strongly that the
                    national FDP was tied too firmly to Adenauer's Christian Democrats. He could
                    take them for granted, and therefore paid little attention to their programs or
                    their personalities. He would give them a couple of cabinet positions and then,
                    as far as they were concerned, proceed to ignore them from then on. The North
                    Rhine - Westphalia FDP felt that it was a mistake to be in a position of
                    perpetual junior partner to the CDU, and that they could increase their
                    influence considerably by showing that they were open in both directions, that
                    is, to the SPD as well as the CDU. They couldn't do anything about it in the
                    Bundestag, because the CDU didn't really need them at the national level. But in
                    North Rhine - Westphalia the CDU did need them to have a majority in the
                    Landtag, so they used that power to make a point against the national position
                    of the CDU. Some of the FDP Bundestag deputies, including my old military
                    opponent General Von Manteuffel, just couldn't stomach the thought of a
                    coalition with the Social Democrats, so they resigned from the FDP, formed a new
                    party called the FVP, the Freie Volkspartei, which disappeared in the next
                    election. But the North Rhine - Westphalia FDP did make their point. They got
                    more out of the coalition with the North Rhine - Westphalia SPD than they had
                    from the CDU, and ever since then on a national level too, the FDP has sometimes
                    formed governments with CDU, sometimes with the SPD. As far as they were
                    concerned, they achieved their objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there when that kernel grew to a...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, this was the first time that this new position of being a swing
                    party was manifested in a major province (Land) and it's been a part of German
                    politics ever since. It has happened in other Laender governments in the
                    meantime and on the national level too on occasion.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I mentioned the lack of specific guidance about what I, as political officer in
                    Duesseldorf, should be trying to do and what my attitude should be toward the
                    various parties and their leaders. In those days there was still a political
                    officer in each of the consulates, and we had consulates in more cities in
                    Germany than we do today. The Embassy would gather the political officers from
                    the consulates, plus Berlin and what we called “land observers” in the
                    provincial capitals where we had no consulate, for quarterly meetings at the
                    Embassy in Bonn. The Embassy people listened and seemed very appreciative of any
                    information or views that we brought in from the field. I can't say that we were
                    given any guidance as to what our objectives should be and rarely if ever heard
                    anything from Washington. Those embassy political officers who were particularly
                    concerned with internal German political affairs, Bill Buffum, Jonathan Dean and
                    Hugh Appling, were always very friendly. Appling and Buffum came occasionally to
                    meetings of the provincial political organizations, and we had very good contact
                    with them. But I couldn't call it guidance; they certainly didn't tell me what I
                    should be trying to get the parties there to do, although we all had a good
                    grasp of general U.S. policy toward Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you went back to the Department where you served
                        from 1958 to '62 in a variety of positions. What were you doing when you
                        first came back, in 1958?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SULSER: It was shortly after what was known as the Wriston program had begun when
                    a lot of Departmental civil service employees were more or less dragooned into
                    the Foreign Service, and Foreign Service employees found themselves for the
                    first time assigned routinely to Washington. Previously it had been rare. Only
                    in the case of a medical problem of the officer or his family or because an
                    officer was known to one of the higher ups in the Department and was requested
                    for a country desk job, or a special assistant or policy planning position. But
                    it had not been normal for Foreign Service people to serve in Washington. A lot
                    of the Washington people that were pressed into the Foreign Service and sent
                    abroad were out of the Intelligence Bureau, INR, and suddenly there were a lot
                    of Foreign Service people in INR. I was in what was called the “requirements
                    staff” in INR. I was responsible for keeping in touch with the Soviet and East
                    European analysis in INR, the appropriate desk officers in the European Bureau
                    and other agencies to keep our posts in those countries informed of what
                    Washington wanted to know—what its requirements for information on the Soviet
                    Union and Eastern Europe were. I prepared regular quarterly lists of reporting
                    requirements. We'd do ad hoc requests as well, and evaluations of the reporting
                    from abroad. When a new officer was going out to our Embassy in Moscow or any of
                    the Eastern European countries, I would arrange briefings for them around
                    Washington so they'd know who their end-users were and establish this direct,
                    face-to-face contact with them. It was the first position since my Polish
                    veterans DP visas in London that had anything directly to do with the area that
                    had been my primary interest before I came into the Foreign Service. I had no
                    reason to believe from the comments I got in INR or in the personnel office that
                    this was known when I was assigned to the job. It was just an assignment as far
                    as they were concerned. But I took a special interest in it because of this
                    background. I had requested on the old “April Fool” sheets, as we called them
                    back then (because every April 1 you were supposed to inform the Department
                    where you would like to be assigned the next several times, and any special
                    studies and interests you had), assignments in the Balkan area and for
                    Serbo-Croatian language training, none of which ever produced any response. But
                    suddenly, there I was. When I called on the officer in EUR who was responsible
                    for Albania (as well as Romania, it was Monty Spear), I happened to notice on
                    his desk a copy of my thesis on U.S.-Albanian relations that I had donated to
                    the State Department library when it was completed at the University of
                    Wisconsin in 1950. In the course of our conversation I pointed out my thesis on
                    his desk; he had not connected the author of that book with the person who was
                    sitting across the desk from him. When he had taken over the job some time
                    earlier, he had been totally without experience about Albania (his primary
                    interest was Romania) and he had asked for background information. The only
                    thing the Department was able to produce for him was this copy of my 8-year-old
                    thesis.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>After I had been in that job about five months, I got a call from the Washington
                    assignments office in personnel instructing me to come over to the PER office to
                    discuss a new assignment. I had not asked for any kind of transfer or
                    reassignment, but of course I dutifully went over to the personnel office to be
                    informed that I had been selected for a new position as Deputy Chief of European
                    Assignments Division in the Office of Personnel. The position had just been
                    created because the staff in European Assignments was overworked. I was taken
                    over to meet the chief of European assignments, Tom McElhiney, and he told me
                    they were looking forward to having me join, attend the officer assignment
                    panels with him as a full member of the panel, etc. I said, “Well, do I have a
                    choice in this, because I have a job I like in INR and now you are offering me a
                    job I'd never even heard of or thought of filling before.” He laughed, and he
                    said, “Anytime PER wants you, you do not have a choice, that's your assignment.”
                    I saluted and went back to INR and told them I was being moved to PER. They
                    informed me that a month later the chief of the requirements staff, Bill
                    Stedman, was being transferred to university training in development economics,
                    and I was to become the chief of branch, which would have provided a
                    differential in pay. In those days a Foreign Service officer assigned to a civil
                    service position in the Department at a higher grade received the salary of the
                    higher grade without changing his FSO rank. I thought, “Oh well, now you tell
                    me! But I'm told in any case that I don't have a choice; I've been drafted for
                    PER.” So off I went to PER and spent roughly a year as deputy chief of European
                    assignments, learning that a quarter of all officer positions in those days were
                    in Germany, and the European assignments handled over half of all FSO positions
                    in the Foreign Service. We had twice weekly meetings of what was called Panel A,
                    the officer assignment panel. After a few months McElhiney was transferred and
                    Galen Stone took over as chief of the branch. Our staff was divided into two
                    sections: one run by Free Matthews and the other by Sam Gammon, both of whom
                    remain friends and who did very well in the Foreign Service, as did Galen Stone
                    and Tom McElhiney as well. We had some excellent officers there, as were all the
                    members of the assignments panel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might just diverge here. One of the things that I think
                        anybody looking at the Foreign Service, that is different from any ordinary
                        business, is that personnel, which is usually sort of a routine clerical
                        function, personnel is so key to the Foreign Service that really it is often
                        some of the best and brightest end up in that. A Personnel assignment is a
                        very normal thing for up-and-coming people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SULSER: Well, certainly that was the impression given by the people in charge. It
                    was an honor to be chosen and a recognition of ability and potential. I did find
                    the work extremely absorbing. In those days PER had a great deal of authority.
                    We would get lists of positions that were becoming vacant over the next several
                    months, and lists of officers who were becoming available for assignment during
                    that time. We would do our best to fill the positions with people who were
                    qualified. We would research their performance files, their records and language
                    skills, we'd talk to anybody we wanted to about their abilities and
                    suitabilities. Then we would come into these meetings of the panel and debate
                    these assignments. There was always at least one member who would argue against
                    a given assignment. There was a real give and take. The chairman of the panel,
                    who was the director of personnel operations (Wally Stuart when I first went
                    there, and Don Downs was his deputy), could theoretically make a decision
                    unilaterally. In every instance that I can recall, it was clear what the
                    consensus of the panel was. Then we would inform the appropriate bureau that we
                    were proposing to assign so-and-so to such-and-such position. The Bureau
                    Executive Office could go to the pertinent country area of the Bureau and tell
                    them what was being done. If there was some objection or question raised, they
                    could come back to us and say, this has been mentioned, that has been mentioned,
                    we wonder whether this is an appropriate assignment. They could go to the extent
                    of putting a hold on the assignment, good for one week. We would then go back to
                    the panel and say, “This objection has been raised. We still feel this
                    assignment should proceed.” Or we'd say, this was something we had not known,
                    and we'd agree with the bureau that the assignment should not go forward. The
                    panel would again make a decision and that was it! Travel orders would be issued
                    and the movement would begin. You really felt that you were doing something that
                    was important to the individuals and to the Foreign Service as a whole. You were
                    making decisions in that panel, and I always felt they were good decisions.
                    Despite the give and take and the occasional heated arguments in there, after
                    each panel meeting we would go as a group out to lunch somewhere, and that would
                    sort of smooth over any hard feelings. We all remained on good terms and in many
                    cases are still friends with people who were in those panels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the charges often laid against Personnel is that
                        EUR people tend to stay in EUR, ARA people tend to stay in ARA, you know,
                        the devil you know is better than the one you don't know, or the Old Boy
                        network, or whatever. Also, that some of the more senior officers would have
                        favorites, somebody who was a staff assistant to an assistant secretary,
                        often they would get better jobs. Did you find this mechanism working?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>SULSER: There is some truth to that. It was often the case that people would
                    remain within a given area, where they were known, experienced, where their
                    qualifications were clear, and that was generally what the officer preferred.
                    But there was in my experience very little intervention from outside on the part
                    of the bureaus or higher ups in the Department. When Wally Stuart left, John
                    Jova took his place, and Jova, whom I admired, was one of the smoothest
                    operators I ever encountered in the Foreign Service, would have occasional
                    meetings with Loy Henderson, who was then the Under Secretary for Management or
                    Administration. John would come into panel meetings after those sessions with
                    Henderson, which seemed usually to concern ambassadorial appointments or DCM
                    appointments, and say, “So-and-so is being assigned to such-and-such position.”
                    That was, after all, our own chain of command. All other jobs, section chiefs in
                    embassies abroad, country directors in the State Department, etc., were filled
                    out of this normal give and take within the assignments panel. Everybody on the
                    panel, of course, knew other people within the Foreign Service, and when you're
                    in a position like that a lot of people you know want to take advantage of the
                    opportunity to try and get their view across as to what they'd like to do and
                    where they'd like to go. So you're being invited to lunch by people you knew who
                    are interested in some job that they heard was coming up. There was some of
                    that, but a great deal less than you would assume. While there were a lot of
                    approaches made of that sort, the results were not nearly what you'd expect
                    either. The members of the assignments panel took their work so seriously that
                    they would have been very embarrassed to come in and face their colleagues and
                    propose an assignment that was obviously justified only on a personal basis. I
                    don't think there was much of that. Maybe I was naive, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I served later on, from '67 to '69 in the (personnel)
                        counseling side of things, and it was very much the same. Then, let's see,
                        you came to the Department in '58, so you were there, INR was about '58 or a
                        little into '59 or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: No, I started in INR in January of '58, and I was transferred to PER in
                    June of '58. After about a year there, the chief of the training assignments
                    branch (Phil Chadbourn) was departing, and I was moved from being Deputy Chief
                    of the European Assignments Branch to be Chief of Training Assignments Branch.
                    Still a member of Panel A, but my job then was to fill up the training slots at
                    FSI and elsewhere with people. All the way from the Senior Seminar and War
                    Colleges on down to language classes, mid-career course, university training,
                    etc. I did that for a year or so. I was also Executive Secretary of the Training
                    Policy Committee, chaired by Henderson and consisting of several Assistant
                    Secretaries, which made projections of training needs and budget
                    recommendations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in the training slot, what was the attitude
                        of what you would call the most aggressive bright officers, the one we'd
                        almost call the water-walkers, what have you, towards training?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SULSER: They did not want to waste time in training. I think that's a quick
                    summary. Most of our training assignments were filled because people would ask
                    for training or needed it for some job they were going to, such as language
                    training. The most careful selection was for senior training, like the Senior
                    Seminar, the War Colleges, and we would convene a selection panel of deputy
                    assistant secretaries from around the Department and work up a list of FSO 3s,
                    as they were in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is approximately at the colonel level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, I think it is 01 under the present system. Anyway, those who had
                    above-average records, who were considered to have above-average potential, and
                    we would make up a list of what we considered suitable candidates for senior
                    training. We would draw their performance files and pass them around among
                    people on this senior selection panel. Deputy assistant secretaries, even
                    assistant secretaries, and we would sit around for days and discuss which ones
                    should be selected for training. In some cases the members of that selection
                    panel would consult people they knew who were among the candidates and come back
                    and say, “Oh, no, so-and-so doesn't want to go to training at this particular
                    time because he's in line for such-and-such job or can't be spared.” The
                    selections for senior training were done without regard to formal availability.
                    These were not just people who were due to be transferred, concluding whatever
                    assignment they were currently in. They had to be taken from something to go to
                    this training. A number of people managed to get out of it by telling a friend
                    on the selection panel that they didn't want to be taken. Some people who were
                    selected by the panel and informed that they were going to go to War College or
                    Senior Seminar would come back to us, usually through their supervisors or
                    executive offices in whatever bureau they were in and say, “This person can't be
                    spared.” We had considerable fallout, and much of that was due to the “water
                    walkers” as you termed them, who didn't like the prospect of taking a year off
                    to do something they didn't consider was necessary. Some of the most successful
                    officers evaded...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting. It's several layers. The most successful
                        have often evaded it. The successful ones have usually had it. And the
                        average run of officers wouldn't get to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I think that's a fair appraisal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Language training of course is quite different. If you
                        want a job in a difficult place but which may lead somewhere, you've just
                        got to take the language. No doubt about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SULSER: Part of my duties in that position was meeting all the incoming classes
                    of new Foreign Service officers, telling them what their training schedule was
                    going to be over the next several months, how we would determine whether and
                    what language training they were going to get, when their first assignment would
                    be determined and so on. At the end of all that process, after their assignments
                    had been determined, I would meet with them again and tell them where they were
                    going. That was an interesting and pleasing aspect of the job, because I got to
                    see the kind of people who were coming into the Service, their files, their
                    academic background, their language abilities, their private work experience,
                    and it really gave me the feeling that the Foreign Service was upholding a very
                    high standard. When I came into the Foreign Service in 1950, you had to have at
                    least one foreign language to be accepted. By the time that I was in that
                    training position, it was determined that this could no longer be the case,
                    because if we continued to require foreign language the Service would be staffed
                    largely with children of missionaries or with former Mormon missionaries since
                    these were the only people in those days who lived abroad enough to really learn
                    a foreign language. You could enter the Foreign Service without a foreign
                    language, but you were on what was called language probation and had to pass a
                    language examination before a certain number of years. So the question of
                    getting language training when you entered the Service was important to these
                    young people, the majority of whom did not have a language. Sometimes we had to
                    do weird things, like taking somebody who already had a language and assign him
                    to an English-speaking post because he didn't need the training, when he usually
                    wanted to go where he could use that language. In the meantime, we'd put someone
                    who didn't know a language into training and send them to a post where that
                    language was spoken so they could improve their ability in it.</p>

                <p>When we'd get someone who had a number of languages, they would stand out! One of
                    them I remember was Melissa Foelsch, as she was known in those days. She was the
                    daughter of one of the best known Viennese operetta singers, Melitsa Kordos, who
                    made a number of movies back in the '30s, usually based on Viennese operettas
                    like Tales from the Vienna Woods. Melissa had traveled around with her mother
                    and came into the Foreign Service with a fluent level in half a dozen different
                    languages. We assigned her to INR for her first assignment, where she was the
                    Austrian analyst. The Austrian desk officer in those days was Al Wells. He was a
                    staff aide to David Bruce when Bruce was Ambassador in Bonn while I was in
                    Duesseldorf, and Al was then on the Austrian desk. He met Melissa in the course
                    of their regular staff meetings and married her. She blazed a trail for women in
                    the Foreign Service by refusing to resign when she got married. The Department
                    for the first time decided that they were not going to require it. Some woman
                    finally stood up and said “No!” to what had always been the practice before
                    then. The woman I married in 1952 had to resign. Melissa didn't do it. She
                    stayed in the Foreign Service. They had one child then. When David Bruce was
                    chosen to be Ambassador to the Court of St. James in London, he asked for Al to
                    be his staff aide again; and Al went off to London leaving Melissa in INR. When
                    she came up for her next normal assignment, she was assigned to Kingston,
                    Jamaica, as I recall. Then she went to Paris. That was close enough to London;
                    they could see each other occasionally again. She got transferred to London at a
                    time when tandem assignments were becoming known in the Foreign Service, with
                    both husband and wife being in the Service. But they had a rule then that one
                    could not be in a position of any authority over the other, so it was only
                    possible in large embassies. Al was Ambassador's staff aide then. So Al chose to
                    retire. A little bit of personal comment on one of the people that I happened to
                    meet in that training officer position. It had an effect on my career that I'll
                    get to later.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>As my normal two years in Personnel were coming to an end, I had been paneled for
                    the Berlin Desk in EUR, to be my first country desk position. I was looking
                    forward to that job. It was of personal interest to me and I thought it was a
                    good job for that stage of my career. It was at that time that John Jova became
                    Chief of Personnel operations. After he had been there only a couple of weeks,
                    he looked around the table in one of the panel sessions and realized that
                    everyone else there was about to leave. All of the experience and continuity
                    would disappear. When the meeting ended, he called me to his office and asked me
                    if I would be willing to stay on another year as his special assistant, give up
                    the Berlin desk. I appreciated his position and his request, and I had enjoyed
                    the Personnel experience so I agreed to do this. I spent what turned out to be
                    nearly a third year in Personnel, as Jova's special assistant, which put me in
                    charge of Panel B, the staff corps assignment panel. I was also the liaison
                    between Personnel and other government departments with an interest in the
                    Foreign Service, such as Commerce and Labor, for assignment of commercial
                    attach�s, labor attach�s. While I was in that position, John Kennedy was elected
                    President. The transition team moved into the State Department, and they had a
                    large number of personnel matters they wanted to deal with. I was detached from
                    other duties and became Jova's representative to the transition team, and spent
                    many, many hours, more than full-time, just dealing with proposals from the
                    Kennedy transition team, trying to explain to them why they couldn't do what
                    they wanted to do, or yes, you can do that, BUT...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember, more than almost any other transition you had
                        a lot of Kennedy transition people running around the corridors of the State
                        Department, not only in Personnel but trying to launch attempts, sort of
                        unauthorized attempts to launch foreign policy initiatives. I mean they were
                        very activist and not very disciplined. Do you have any stories to tell
                        about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: This was the only transition team I had any personal experience with, so
                    I can't compare them. But I assure you it was a wild period, just in the field
                    that I had personal knowledge of, the Personnel field. They had a lot of ideas
                    about things they wanted to do and reorganizations they wanted to effect, people
                    that they wanted to move around. It was a real new broom approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were “they?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SULSER: He had some ex-Foreign Service people on the staff. I can't recall names
                    now. That was a very long time ago. We're talking 1961 here. But I recall
                    feeling like a terrible “wet blanket” because I spent all my time explaining why
                    something couldn't be done that they wanted to do or why something could be
                    done, if at all, in a different way than they were proposing. Much of what I
                    said was ignored. They found other ways to get these things done. It was an
                    extremely active period. A couple of months after Kennedy took office, when Al
                    Wells was transferred from the Austrian desk to London, to be David Bruce's
                    staff aide, suddenly that job opened up. Jova, who said he felt sorry for having
                    kept me in Personnel longer than the normal two years and having missed that
                    Berlin desk job, said that if I wanted it now, I could take the Austrian desk
                    position, rather than filling out a full third year there. I said I would do
                    that, because by that time I was becoming rather frustrated with the job, which
                    was running me ragged, and I was not feeling as effective as I had before. I
                    felt like I was swatting at ghosts much of the time, spinning wheels and not
                    really getting a lot done that was very satisfying. So I left PER then and took
                    the Austrian desk.</p>
                <p>That was April of '61. As far as I knew, I was the only country desk officer in
                    the Department whose Ambassador came to see him every week. The Austrian
                    Ambassador had a standing appointment with me at a certain hour, it was a
                    Thursday morning as I recall, where he could appear, usually with his deputy, to
                    go over whatever questions he had in mind, communications he had received,
                    issues the Embassy was considering, and I could go over with them things that
                    were on our mind. It was Ambassador Platzer, whom I caught up with again later
                    in London. He told me that when his predecessor was taking that job, while Tommy
                    Thompson was Ambassador in Vienna, Thompson had advised this Austrian Ambassador
                    coming to Washington that if he wanted to get business done in the State
                    Department he should deal with the country desk officer and not, like most
                    ambassadors in town, insist on seeing no one lower than an Assistant Secretary.
                    Austrian ambassadors had followed that advice ever since—by that time, it was
                    several years. They still consider it was an effective way to do business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this from your point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I enjoyed it, because I knew that none of my colleagues in EUR or other
                    bureaus had that much contact with their ambassadors. For the most part, when
                    their Ambassadors came in, the desk officer's role was to go down to the front
                    entrance, meet them and escort them to the office of the Deputy Assistant
                    Secretary or Assistant Secretary, or Under Secretary or whatever, take notes and
                    write up a memorandum of conversation afterwards; and, of course, draft
                    telegrams going out to our Embassy in the country for approval at some higher
                    level. Here I was, receiving the Austrian Ambassador weekly. In those days, a
                    foreign ambassador could walk into the State Department and up to the desk
                    officer's office. I didn't even have to go down to the front entrance to meet
                    him if he didn't stand on protocol. Security was such that he could appear at my
                    door!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the type of things that you'd be talking about
                        on a normal visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: We talked a lot about Austrian assets in the United States, which had
                    been seized back at the beginning of World War II, when Austria was part of
                    Germany after the 1938 Anschluss. All Austrian-owned assets in the U.S. were
                    seized by the Alien Property Custodian, as being German controlled and
                    therefore, enemy assets. After the War, indeed even after the State treaty in
                    1955, we were still holding on to those assets. Although we had negotiated a
                    treaty, that treaty had not yet been ratified to return the assets to Austrian
                    nationals. As far as the people in the Department of Justice, who administered
                    the program, were concerned, the Austrians who on paper owned or controlled
                    these assets were really front-men for German individuals or companies and
                    therefore they were not truly Austrian assets.</p>
                <p>There was also the question of the South Tyrol, in Italy, the former Austrian
                    part of northern Italy where there was an agreement after the war between
                    Gruber, when he was Austrian foreign minister, and de Gasperi, when he was the
                    Italian foreign minister, extending certain rights to the German speaking
                    minority in the Italian South Tyrol, which the Italians referred to as Alto
                    Adige. The Austrians were dissatisfied with the treatment that the
                    German-speaking minority there was getting, didn't feel that the Gruber-de
                    Gasperi agreement was being fully observed. They suspected the United States was
                    not putting pressure on Italy because Italy was now a NATO ally. The Austrians
                    kept hoping that we would press the Italians to be more cooperative and give
                    more rights to the German speakers in what the Austrians called South Tyrol.</p>
                <p>Those were among the normal things we dealt with. Shortly after I was in that
                    job, I was asked by the Deputy Assistant Secretary in EUR responsible for our
                    area, Dick Davis, to call the Austrian Ambassador and ask him to see him. This
                    was the first time in the couple of months I had been on the job that anybody
                    higher up had asked to see the Austrians. I called Ambassador Platzer and asked,
                    “Please could you come in and see Mr. Davis tomorrow morning?” On that occasion
                    I did meet him and brought him up to Davis' office. The reason Davis asked to
                    see him was to tell Ambassador Platzer that President Kennedy would like to meet
                    with Khrushchev in Vienna if this was alright with the Austrian government.
                    Ambassador Platzer replied immediately that he did not need to consult Vienna,
                    he could say yes right then and there. That began the whole process of arranging
                    the first summit meeting, the famous one in Vienna, between Kennedy and
                    Khrushchev, in which Khrushchev was supposed to have tried to intimidate this
                    young American President and scare him that they were going to take over Berlin
                    and all sorts of things like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>As the desk officer, I was involved in the logistic arrangements for the visit.
                    Immediately after getting Austrian concurrence that day, the White House travel
                    and advance people began showing up, needing arrangements to be made for all the
                    things that are involved in a presidential visit. One of the first sessions I
                    had with the White House people involved looking at the layout of the American
                    Ambassador's residence in Vienna to decide who was going to be in what room, and
                    I was rather shocked to find that President Kennedy and his wife required
                    separate bedrooms; and of course he required that this and that assistant be
                    immediately at hand as well. The result was that we had to ask the American
                    Ambassador, Freeman Matthews' father, to vacate the residence! “Doc” Matthews
                    was one of our most senior career ambassadors, one of the first to be given the
                    grade of career ambassador. This was rather a shock to me that a President,
                    going to a meeting in Ambassador Matthews' country, would pre-empt the
                    residence, partly because the President and his wife required separate bedrooms.
                    My original thought had been, okay, President and Mrs. Kennedy can have the
                    master suite and Ambassador and Mrs. Matthews can move into the guest room, and
                    there are still enough bedrooms for the National Security Adviser and the press
                    secretary, Secret Service, etc. But no, they required every single room there,
                    and Matthews had to move out into other quarters. We had a lot of meetings with
                    the Secret Service and the White House communications people, because of course
                    they had to set up special telephone lines and all that sort of thing. Which had
                    the little side benefit that I could call the Embassy in Vienna any time of day
                    or night, through the White House switchboard and talk to people and get my
                    business done!</p>
                <p>As you know, the meeting happened, and everything seemed to go pretty well,
                    except when the President got back, my gosh, we had a big program to build bomb
                    shelters in our back yards and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a scary time. I think people forget about this. The
                        reserves were called up in Berlin. I remember discussing very seriously with
                        my wife whether it was a good time for her and the children to be in
                        Washington. Maybe it was a good idea to get...I mean would we stay together
                        because it sounded like there might be a missile exchange!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SULSER: It was a scary time. There were articles in the newspapers about bomb
                    shelters and lists of companies that could build shelters that passed government
                    requirements and were believed to be radiation-proof and all that. And about
                    what kind of supplies you needed to store in your shelter and how long you
                    should expect to be there. I even went to the extent of getting plans for one of
                    these shelters, because the house that we bought when we came back for that
                    Washington assignment had a very large hill behind the house that looked as
                    though it would be ideal for digging in and making one of these underground
                    shelters. The other side of the hill faced Washington, so I had the hill to
                    absorb the radiation or heat blast that might come from the missile...we were
                    only five or six miles from the Pentagon, so if that was one of the targets,
                    well we were pretty close. It was a scary time and there were a lot of people in
                    the State Department who were then involved in planning the relocation center
                    out in the mountains, and with keeping the central records and identifying the
                    people who would be moved to that location when the emergency came. It had a big
                    effect!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the long run, I guess it was counter-productive,
                        because it got the President's back up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, he obviously took Khrushchev's threats rather seriously and came
                    back and mobilized the government in a way it had not been mobilized previously,
                    at least since the Korean War. It was a frightening business.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The following year, in '62, the Austrian Chancellor, then Alphons Gorbach, was
                    invited to visit Washington. That was the other highlight of my time on the
                    Austrian desk. I had to prepare briefing papers for the White House. There was a
                    man on the NSC staff responsible for that area, David Klein, whom I had known
                    earlier in Germany, who was responsible for putting the briefing book together
                    in the White House. I was responsible for getting it up to S/S, which was
                    responsible for getting it over to the White House. The main issue at that time
                    was the Austrian government's express desire to have some sort of arrangement
                    with the new European Economic Community. Austria, like many European countries,
                    is much more dependent on foreign trade than the United States was at the time,
                    and probably still is to this day, and a very large portion of Austria's trade
                    was with Germany. Germany was in the European Economic Community, and the
                    Austrians feared that as the Community raised its external barriers while
                    diminishing its internal barriers to trade, this would work against Austria's
                    interests. So they wanted to have some kind of an arrangement, which they had
                    trouble defining, because to a considerable extent European Community was linked
                    with NATO and the members of the Community were members of NATO; and Austria had
                    put itself in a perpetual state of neutrality in order to get rid of the
                    four-power occupation in 1955. So they were reluctant and felt the Russians
                    would make a lot of trouble for them if they moved too far toward becoming a
                    part of this European Economic Community. They wanted some kind of association
                    with the Community, and eventually Sweden and Switzerland and other major
                    European neutral countries also sought something of that sort. Austria wanted
                    the United States to be sympathetic toward this approach. There were a lot of
                    people in the State Department, in particular George Ball, Bob Schaetzel, Dick
                    Vine, who were all for maintaining the purity of the European Economic Community
                    and for not watering it down to any extent that might be necessary to
                    accommodate the interests of these neutral countries. In the process of trying
                    to get agreement on briefing papers for the Chancellor's upcoming visit, these
                    “Europeans,” I guess you could call them, decided that Austria could be seen as
                    a “special case.” They were prepared to see some kind of arrangement made for
                    Austria, but not for Sweden or Switzerland, on the grounds that Austria was not
                    really voluntarily neutral. They rationalized that Austria had taken on this
                    neutrality only to get rid of the Russian occupation (and in the process also
                    the U.S., British and French troops). This was the position they wanted to work
                    into the briefing papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, you were saying about the Europeanists, how they
                        were coming around to the idea of making an exception for Austria into the
                        European Economic Community.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SULSER: The Austrians were not sure how they should regard this. On the one hand,
                    they wanted our blessing for some sort of association with the EEC; on the other
                    hand, they did not want to be singled out as a “special case,” because they felt
                    that if the other neutral countries were barred from any arrangement with the
                    EEC, this would identify Austria as being not really neutral, being a little too
                    associated with NATO, and that the Russians would cause problems and the whole
                    thing could founder on Soviet objections. They were not very happy about this
                    approach. Anyhow, that's the way it went forward. The man I knew on the NSC
                    staff, David Klein, early on in preparation of these briefing papers, called me
                    and said, “Where is such and such a paper?” I'd tell him, “Well, we drafted them
                    and they're sitting over in RPE,” (where Schaetzel, Cleveland, and Vine were),
                    or they're hung up in the Under Secretary's office, or they're in S/S, or
                    something.” He said, “Well, you know I would like to see the papers in their
                    draft form. Would you please bootleg to me every paper that you do, send me a
                    copy directly. While it goes through the procedure and eventually gets over to
                    me with all the necessary initials and approval, I want to see them in their
                    unadulterated form.” So I circumvented channels and sent him everything as it
                    was originally drafted.</p>
                <p>One benefit I got out of this personal connection was when it came time to
                    prepare guest lists for the luncheon the President was to give the Chancellor,
                    or who was to go over and brief the President before the Chancellor arrived,
                    these things were done at higher levels than I because they included
                    congressmen, etc. Klein called me to say these lists had been received and my
                    name was nowhere on them. Wasn't I interested in coming over and participating?
                    When the message came over from the White House about briefing the President in
                    advance, it was specified that it was to be the Secretary of State, the Under
                    Secretary of State, and me! And I was on the guest list for the luncheon
                    following the President's meeting with the Chancellor.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>As it turned out, the President's meeting with the Chancellor coincided with the
                    semi-annual ministerial NATO meeting in Europe, so the Secretary and the
                    Assistant Secretary were at the NATO meeting. Thus, the briefers were to be
                    Acting Secretary George Ball, Acting EUR Assistant Secretary Bill Tyler, and
                    myself. We went over about an hour before the Chancellor was due to arrive at
                    the White House and were ushered into the Oval Office and met the President. I'm
                    sure you remember the innumerable pictures of meetings in the Oval Office in
                    Kennedy's time when they had these love seats on either side of the fireplace
                    and between them, facing the fireplace, a rocking chair on which the President
                    sat. Ball and Tyler were on one of the love seats and I was on the other, and
                    the President was in his rocking chair between us. There was a coffee table in
                    between and he had his feet up on the coffee table and was gently rocking
                    himself while we were talking, which brought his feet just about in front of my
                    face. I noticed that he had the most grubby looking stockings on, much worse
                    than I would wear even to go to work, much less to a meeting in the White House.
                    They had been laundered way too many times, were shapeless and faded. When we
                    walked in, he shook our hands and invited us to sit down. He had the briefing
                    book Klein had prepared. It was a big thick thing, it must have been three
                    inches thick, full of biographic reports and all these briefing papers on
                    numerous subjects, and he said, “I haven't had time to look at this, so you guys
                    give me a quick idea of what this meeting is all about; and when we're with the
                    Chancellor you take the lead, and when I get the feel for things, I'll chime
                    in.” All the work that had gone into preparing that briefing book, only to hear
                    him say that he hadn't had time to look at it!</p>
                <p>Ball and Tyler quickly reviewed some of the issues and how we felt about them, of
                    which the question of the association with the EEC was the principal one. Before
                    we had talked even 10 minutes or so, somebody came in with a beautiful teak box
                    which he opened to show the President. This was the present from the Chancellor
                    to the President, which would be given to him later by the Chancellor. This
                    staff person thought he might like to see it first, before he was given it
                    officially. It was a boarding saber from an Austrian warship, because of the
                    President's naval experience in World War II. The President reacted with great
                    glee, snatching it out of the box and waving it around like a kid at Christmas.
                    There was a plaque on the inside lid of the box saying it was a boarding saber
                    from a vessel that had fought in the war of Schleswig-Holstein. The President
                    turned to Ball and said, “Who were they fighting in the war of
                    Schleswig-Holstein.” Ball didn't know and he turned to Tyler. Tyler didn't know
                    and turned to me. This was the first question in the briefing process that had
                    gotten down to me. The rest were fielded by Ball and Tyler and I was just an
                    interested onlooker. Of course, I didn't know either. When I got home, I looked
                    it up in the history books and found that it was the German states, Prussia and
                    Austria, fighting Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein before the formation of the
                    German Empire.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>By the time this little incident ended, another staff member stuck his head in
                    the door and announced that the Chancellor and his party were arriving at the
                    front entrance. The four of us jumped up and went down the hall to an elevator
                    into the basement of the White House. We were walking down a long narrow
                    corridor of the basement, and at one point Lyndon Johnson was standing in the
                    corridor. As the four of us caught up with him, nothing was said to him, nobody
                    even said hello. He fell in behind us, and we proceeded on down the corridor. We
                    came to an elevator to take us up to the level of the front entrance. The
                    elevator door opened, and the President and Ball, who were busy talking, and
                    Tyler and I and the Vice President filed into the elevator and went up to the
                    main floor. I was the last one to step into the elevator, so I was closest to
                    the door. When we got to the main floor, the President's naval aide, Tad
                    Shepard, was standing there waiting to escort the party to the front entrance.
                    Nobody had briefed me on protocol in the White House. I didn't know whether
                    being closest to the door I was supposed to step out, or whether the President
                    was supposed to make his way through us and go out first. I didn't know what to
                    do since no one else was moving. I began to teeter forward, teeter back, teeter
                    forward again. Finally, I caught Tad Shepard's eye, and when I began to teeter
                    forward again he shook his head as if to say, “No, No!” So then I knew I was
                    supposed to wait. Sure enough, when the President got finished saying whatever
                    he was saying to Ball, he wormed through the crowd and came out first. And then
                    Johnson, then Ball, then Tyler and finally me. By this time the Chancellor and
                    Foreign Minister Kreisky, Ambassador Platzer and Deputy Foreign Minister
                    Steiner, who was a People's Party man, were at the front door. We went up and
                    welcomed them and showed them down to the Cabinet Room, where the meeting was to
                    be held. Nora Lejins, the State Department principal German translator, was
                    waiting there, and the meeting progressed with the Americans on one side of the
                    Cabinet table and the Austrians and Lejins on the other side.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Chancellor Gorbach did not speak English, but the other three Austrians did, so
                    the discussion was a mixture of German and English. As the President had
                    instructed in the Oval Office, Tyler and Ball did most of the talking and
                    responding to the Chancellor's questions. After a time President Kennedy chimed
                    in, more or less supporting what had been said and expressing his best wishes
                    and best hopes, all that kind of business. It was agreed that Tyler and Foreign
                    Secretary Kreisky should get together on a statement to be made at the end of
                    the meeting. They went off into one corner of the room, and the Chancellor took
                    the opportunity to present the boarding saber to the President. It had been
                    rewrapped in the meantime. The President opened the package and acted
                    beautifully, as if he had never seen the thing before and again was obviously
                    very pleased with his present, thanked the Chancellor profusely and said, “Come
                    with me.” He sort of grabbed the Chancellor's elbow and ushered him back into
                    the Oval Office, I tagged along because Mrs. Lejins was busy working on this
                    statement to be made in German for Gorbach to tell the press when he emerged
                    later that day from the meeting. Since Gorbach didn't speak English, I went with
                    him and the President back into the Oval Office. As we passed through Mrs.
                    Lincoln's room, the President's secretary, between the Cabinet Room and the Oval
                    Office, he told her to have the press come in. He wanted pictures taken with the
                    Chancellor and the boarding saber. Moments after we got into the Oval Office,
                    another door opened up and several newspapermen came in and photographers and
                    Kennedy went through the business of flashing the saber around, shaking the
                    Chancellor's hand, and the Chancellor would look at me for translation of what
                    the President had said. For a moment I was the unofficial interpreter. Forever
                    after, as long as Kennedy was alive, pictures that appeared in newspapers and
                    magazines of him in the Oval Office, there was this saber and the scabbard it
                    came in hung on the wall. He apparently did genuinely like it and had it mounted
                    on the wall. I still have in my study at home a very large copy of one of the
                    pictures taken of Kennedy and Gorbach with this saber. It was a nice
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>After the meeting was over, they had the luncheon in the State Dining Room. It
                    was a sizeable affair and there were toasts and whatnot. McGeorge Bundy, the
                    National Security Adviser—I'd never met him—came up to me and thanked me for
                    including him in the guest list. I said, “This didn't have anything to do with
                    me. This was done in the Protocol Office or somewhere.” It seemed to me to be
                    taken for granted the National Security Adviser would be there, but he came up
                    and thanked me (erroneously) for getting him invited to the luncheon.</p>
                <p>That evening the Austrian Ambassador gave a very nice black-tie dinner at his
                    residence which the President did not attend. The Vice President was there and
                    Ball and Tyler. It was a very pleasant day for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>We had one other important visitor during my time on the desk, the Austrian
                    Defense Minister, Schleinzer. He was People's Party and came with his deputy
                    from the Socialist Party (Roesch), because they had what was called the “Big
                    Coalition” at the time, the two main parties. They divided up all the Cabinet
                    posts and each minister had a deputy from the other party. In the foreign
                    ministry Kreisky was Socialist, his deputy was People's Party. The Defense
                    Ministry was the other way around. They came over in connection with their
                    request to borrow $50-60 million to buy more American military equipment for the
                    Austrian armed forces. When the occupation ended in 1955, we had built up a
                    large stockpile of military equipment for the purpose of equipping the Austrian
                    Army when it was recreated. The Pentagon was scared there would be a hiatus
                    between the departure of the foreign occupation troops and the build-up of an
                    effective Austrian Army. In the meantime, if there was any kind of problem, the
                    Russians would be able to re-occupy not only their zone but maybe the whole
                    country with very little effective resistance. It would take so long to build up
                    this Austrian Army.</p>
                <p>One of the measures they took was to develop a stockpile of equipment, and the
                    British and French turned over some small amounts too, but about 95% or so—the
                    new Austrian Army looked like the old American army—their equipment, their
                    helmets, everything was American. By 1962 some of this stuff was wearing out. In
                    any case, they wanted to get more modern equipment, particularly the new M-1
                    tanks the American Army had developed, and they wanted to borrow money. That was
                    the other major issue I worked on during that time, to try to get a coordinated
                    position within the U.S. government as to whether we wanted to extend credits to
                    them and on what terms, because they didn't feel they could pay cash. The
                    Pentagon, of course, was all in favor of selling the equipment. The Treasury
                    Department was not in favor of giving the Austrians a free ride on a loan,
                    wanted them to pay commercial interest rates. The Austrians thought it would
                    look less like a non-neutral U.S.-Austrian military deal if the credit appeared
                    more commercial, namely from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, rather than from the
                    U.S. government as such. There were a lot of negotiations, and we finally
                    arrived at an agreed position. The credit was extended to them and they bought
                    the equipment, which made their forces look even more American, more up to date
                    than it had before.</p>
                <p>There were other military issues. In the State Treaty the Austrians were
                    prohibited from having “guided missiles.” By 1961-'62, because of the
                    improvement of aircraft that had ensued in the meantime, aircraft were firing
                    rockets, and you needed some kind of guided missile for anti-aircraft defense.
                    If the Austrians were to have any kind of effective air force and anti-aircraft
                    equipment, they needed something that could be called guided missiles, although
                    almost certainly the language at the time of the State Treaty meant some kind of
                    ground-to-ground missiles, or something of that sort rather than anti-aircraft
                    stuff. There was a lot of negotiation that never led to a great deal, but a lot
                    of messages back and forth and consideration given to that kind of subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>One of the things the new Kennedy Administration did that I was involved in at
                    the beginning of my time on the Austrian Desk, they gave up the old NSC policy
                    papers and developed a new series of operational guidelines that were to be
                    State Department papers. Not through the NSC system, but would involve
                    inter-departmental consultation and coordination. Al Wells had started drafting
                    the Austrian operational guidelines before I took over the desk, but I finished
                    them and coordinated them with the Pentagon and other government agencies. Those
                    papers, instead of being discussed by the NSC, were then discussed and approved
                    by the Policy Planning staff in the State Department. As it turned out the
                    Austrian operational policy paper was the first one to go through the whole
                    process and get approved. When I was called on to explain and defend this paper
                    in the Policy Planning staff meeting, I found there were one or two people
                    there, perhaps assigned the role of devil's advocate, I don't know, who argued
                    against many of the points. Their principal argument was that the paper did not
                    adequately reflect Austrian neutrality; that we were counting on the Austrians
                    to be less neutral than they appeared to be on the surface. Such things as
                    strategic trade controls, things of that sort, that we were counting on more
                    Austrian cooperation than a strictly neutral position would seem to suggest. I
                    was in a position of having to say, “Well, Austrian neutrality is defined by
                    Austria, not by us. Anything the Austrian government is willing to do, that they
                    feel is consistent with their neutrality, why should we object to it? Why should
                    we want them to be more neutral than they want to be themselves?” The paper was
                    approved and became official U.S. policy.</p>
                <p>After I had been on the desk for about a year and a half, I was invited down to
                    call on Jova, who was still the chief of personnel operations, to tell me that
                    by this time I had been in Washington for five years, longer than the usual
                    Washington assignment for my grade, and I was scheduled for another overseas
                    assignment. He was still grateful that I had stayed on for another nine months
                    to provide some continuity when he was the new chief, so he was going to give me
                    an opportunity to express a preference between two assignments. He said the
                    number two political position in Vienna and the principal officership in Asmara,
                    Eritrea were becoming vacant; which would I prefer? When I left Germany to come
                    home after seven years in Europe, I did not expect to be going back to Europe
                    again because it was the Department's policy to get experience in at least one
                    other area. The job in Asmara was very tempting because it was known among
                    Personnel insiders as one of the hidden “plums”...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nice place but also very important because of Kagnew
                        Station.</hi>

                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, it was a nice place in Africa where the climate was decent because
                    of the altitude. Here was the opportunity for a post of my own, an interesting
                    place with a sizeable U.S. military presence. I had known one or two former
                    principal officers in Asmara, who looked back on that assignment with fond
                    memories. But Europe was the area of my greatest interest when I came in the
                    Foreign Service, all my background there. Here was an opportunity that I felt I
                    had wasted in my four years in Duesseldorf to really become proficient in the
                    language. During all the time I was there I had sought out English-speaking
                    contacts, and if I found a political contact could speak decent English I would
                    speak English with him rather than improving my German. I had regretted that
                    afterward and was happy at the Austrian desk to use some, or at least to read
                    it. I thought here I've had a year and a half on the desk, I know something
                    about the country, the opportunity to go back there. Rightly or wrongly, I chose
                    the Vienna assignment.</p>
                <p>I went to Vienna on a five-year assignment, which was the way it was set up at
                    the time. The Department was being chastised for moving people around too
                    frequently, chastised by Congress for the cost of transporting officers and
                    their families and their household goods. In posts that were not hardship posts
                    and you were a middle-grade officer, you were supposed to be getting longer
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember seeing a report by Congress of how much it cost
                        to move officers, and I was sort of appalled because I was on that list, I
                        was going from Saudi Arabia back to Washington or something and it was
                        expensive. Congress was looking closely at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Oh yes, the Appropriations Committee was giving the Department a very
                    hard time. They always wanted to know the average length of tours of duty, and
                    the average was under two years and the cost of these transfers was astonishing.
                    I never appreciated it myself and I'm sure you didn't either, how much it cost
                    to move you and your family and your household goods and your automobile...</p>
                <p>In any case, they were then setting up assignments in places like Vienna on a
                    five-year basis. Three years, then home leave and back for two years. I went off
                    happily to Vienna, and in one respect at least I lived up to my promise to
                    improve my language ability. When I got to Vienna and began to make political
                    contacts there, I never asked an Austrian whether he could speak English; I
                    always spoke German, and this had a beneficial effect on my language. In fact,
                    in a few cases when I'd have a visitor from Washington and wanted to introduce
                    him to some of these political contacts, I was astonished to find after dealing
                    with them in German for years that some of them spoke excellent English! But
                    because I had approached them in German they spoke German with me.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We still had six officers in the political section, including one man devoted to
                    refugee matters and one labor attach�, and I was the number two. My principal
                    duty was contact with the Socialist Party. After three years I had home leave.
                    In the meantime, the Department had set up these counseling branches that you
                    referred to earlier. For the first time I went around to Personnel and met with
                    the head of the Mid-Career Political Officer Counseling Branch, who was Bob
                    Houghton. He went over my record and said he thought it was a mistake to spend
                    five years in a place like Vienna in a subordinate position because to become a
                    senior officer you needed to demonstrate executive management experience; I
                    shouldn't be going back, three years was enough. I said, “Well, I chose the post
                    but I didn't make the decision to stay there five years. If you are able to get
                    a different assignment for me, rather than going back, fine.” I never heard any
                    more about that and went back. After I had been there another year, four years
                    at that point, the political counselor, John Devine, left, and the Embassy
                    suggested to the Department that I move up into his position. I was still an 03
                    and the position was an 02, and they said they had 02s that needed an
                    assignment. They sent an 02 straight out of the National War College to be the
                    chief of the section. That was Rollie White. I did the full five years as number
                    two. Meantime, we lost a couple of positions, so it became a smaller operation.
                    I had the pleasure of working almost those whole five years with Jimmy
                    Riddleberger as Ambassador, who had succeeded Doc Matthews just before I went
                    there in 1962. Shortly before I left, Riddleberger departed and Douglas
                    MacArthur II arrived as Ambassador. He did not speak German, as Riddleberger
                    had. Ken Sullivan, the labor attach�, and I were the best German speakers in the
                    Embassy, so we took turns accompanying MacArthur on his calls around the city,
                    introducing him there. Then I got notice I had been selected for senior
                    training, and I did not try to get out of that as many had when I was secretary
                    to the selection panel for senior training. I was allocated to the Air War
                    College in Alabama; spent nine months there, my first civilian residence in a
                    southern state, which introduced me to golf. When I got down there, I found
                    there was nothing much to do outside of the school except hang out at the
                    Officer's Club or take up golf, and I thought that golf sounded a little
                    healthier.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SULSER: When I got there they were in that big coalition I mentioned earlier that
                    divided up the government. The Chancellor was People's Party, Alphons Gorbach,
                    and the Vice Chancellor, who was head of the Socialist Party, was Bruno
                    Pittermann. The other Cabinet departments were divided up quite equally, with
                    the Deputy being of the opposite party. It seemed to work very well and we were
                    all of the opinion, as most of the Austrian leaders and opinion-molders,
                    editorial writers, were, that this was a good thing for Austria. Given the
                    pre-war, pre-Anschluss state of politics in Austria, when these parties were
                    more identified with ideologies, they were literally at war with each other.
                    Each had its own army, its own uniformed force, and did indeed carry out
                    military operations against each other. The best way to prevent any kind of
                    reoccurrence of this factional strife was to have the two major parties locked
                    together in the government. This had been the pattern since the War ended in
                    1945. The Communist Party had been in the government briefly, until the first
                    election, when they were virtually wiped out and left the government. By the
                    time I took over the desk in 1961, there were no Communists in Parliament any
                    more, and the only other party outside the government coalition, was the
                    Freiheitliche partei, which was sort of the equivalent of the FDP in Germany,
                    called in English the Freedom Party. The Freedom Party included some of the
                    remnants of the old Austrian Nazi Party. It was a little, almost meaningless
                    faction in the Parliament, which was made up 90% or more by the two major
                    parties. The President of Austria had been a Socialist since 1945 and the
                    Chancellor from the Peoples' Party. Even at that top level the jobs were
                    divided, and it was everyone's opinion that that must be the way the Austrian
                    electorate wanted it because they kept electing Socialist presidents and the
                    Peoples' Party, the largest party in the Parliament, appointed the Chancellor.
                    While I was there, the Peoples' Party won a majority of the Parliament for only
                    the second time since the War and promptly set up a one-party government under
                    Josef Klaus. The Socialist party went into opposition. This was something new
                    and to some extent people worried about it, was this going to renew the kind of
                    factional strife they had had during the '20s and '30s? But in fact it didn't.
                    It lasted for a few years and then the Peoples' Party lost their majority and
                    went back into coalitions. In the meantime, the Freiheitliche partei, to some
                    extent maybe because of age, some of their former Nazi people died off, they got
                    younger leaders, although some of them are also extremely pan-German right-wing
                    types too. But the Freiheitliche partei, to a considerable extent, has been
                    rehabilitated.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting situation there, and quite different from Germany. The
                    different provinces in Austria had special political characteristics. The
                    Socialist Party predominated the Burgenland, which had been part of the Russian
                    occupation zone and was still the least developed, most primitive part of
                    Austria, bordering on Hungary. If you went eastward from Vienna into the
                    Burgenland, things looked different, looked poorer. Then you'd go across into
                    Hungary, and that looked infinitely poorer than the Burgenland. The Austrians
                    used to say that the boundary of Europe begins at the eastern boundary of
                    Austria, and indeed there was a startling difference when you crossed the
                    border. As poor as Burgenland was, it looked rich compared to Hungary in those
                    days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Austrians viewed the Soviet Union and
                        its satellite neighbors at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I never met an Austrian who was friendly to the Soviet Union. They had
                    bad memories of the Soviet occupation. The Soviet occupation zone was plundered
                    for the benefit of the Soviet Union. All the Austrian industries were dismantled
                    and hauled off to the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime there was extremely harsh
                    and left a lot of enemies. As far as the neighboring East European countries
                    were concerned, there was still a lot of nostalgia for the old Austro-Hungarian
                    Empire. Austria, particularly the eastern parts of it, other than Voralberg,
                    Tyrol and Salzburg Provinces, which are largely Germanic, the other provinces
                    have very large Bohemian, Slovakian, Hungarian, Slovenian, Croatian
                    minorities.In the State Treaty and the other arrangements that were made to end
                    the occupation, the Austrians were obliged to give considerable autonomy to
                    those East European minorities in Austria: to permit them their own schools and
                    other cultural institutions; and the Austrians often held up their performance
                    under those agreements as an example of how the Italians ought to treat the
                    German population in the South Tyrol. You'd go from village to village in the
                    eastern part of Austria, particularly in Burgenland, Steiremark (Styria), and
                    Karnten (Carinthia), and villages would have different characteristics. One
                    would be obviously Hungarian, one would be Slovakian, one Slovenian or Croatian
                    in architecture, and had all their language schools, churches and whatnot. There
                    were still a lot of personal and historical ties with the other East European
                    countries. During the time I was there travel across what was known as the Iron
                    Curtain increased considerably. Particularly from the neighboring countries.
                    There was a lot of tourism from those countries into Austria, especially
                    Vienna.</p>
                <p>Every week I would call on the head of the press service in the Chancellor's
                    office, who would review with me the communique issued after the Cabinet
                    meeting, fill me in on the background of the issues that had been discussed and
                    some of the personalities involved. This was a longstanding arrangement that
                    went back through several of my predecessors at the Embassy. One day I was
                    standing in front of the Ballhausplatz, as the Chancellor's office is called,
                    which also houses the Foreign Ministry, waiting for an Embassy car to pick me
                    up. One man with a camera came up to a policeman and asked if it was permitted
                    to take a picture of the Ballhausplatz, because this was the center of the
                    Austrian government and the scene of some famous incidents in the '30s, when
                    Chancellor Dollfuss was murdered. The policeman looked at this man and said to
                    him in German, “You must be from the east.” And the man said yes, he was from
                    Hungary. The policeman said, “Well this is the free West and you can take a
                    picture of any building you want here.” I thought this was an illustrative
                    incident because here was this fellow from Hungary who was used to police
                    controls and not supposed to take pictures of government installations; and here
                    was this Austrian policeman who spoke in a very kindly way, using the familiar
                    “Du” with this visitor, telling him: Look, this is a free country, you want to
                    take a picture of the Ballhausplatz, fine!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling at the time that the CIA and the
                        KGB were using Austria as their own personal sandbox, or something like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Oh, definitely. Going back to the days of the “third man,” the occupation
                    in Austria, when there were a lot of disappearances of agents and other people
                    on both sides. This was indeed a battleground for intelligence agencies, and the
                    Soviets used their long stay in Austria to develop background identities for
                    agents operating all over the Western world. Picking up Austrian identities,
                    some of which were genuine, people who had died in their occupation zone, and
                    they would just take over their records, their names and so on to use as a basis
                    for identities for their agents who would go out into other countries. There
                    were not great Austrian targets for us or for the Soviets there, but there were
                    the targets of other countries, third countries, to be worked on. This survived
                    certainly as long as I was there. During that time too, one of our large FBIS
                    monitoring stations in the eastern Mediterranean closed down and was moved to
                    Austria.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jack, there were two subjects we mentioned, perhaps there
                        is something else you want to mention about your time in Vienna, which was
                        '62 to '67. First, was there any sort of tacit agreement, cooperation
                        between Austria and NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The answer is not that simple. As far as I was ever aware, either as the
                    officer in charge of Austrian affairs in the Department or as Deputy Chief of
                    the Political Section in Vienna, a period that stretches over 6 and a half
                    years, there was never any formal arrangement or exchange of information. But
                    equipping the new Austrian army in 1955 and extending credit in 1962 on somewhat
                    better than commercial terms to buy more U.S. equipment, especially tanks,
                    indicates that the U.S., acting on behalf of NATO you might say but never with
                    NATO as an organization, believed Austria would resist a Warsaw Pact incursion;
                    and we wanted to assist and encourage them in this expectation. Of course, we
                    expected Sweden and Switzerland would also, but we didn't assist them, because
                    they already had reasonably good military forces and had a tradition of
                    neutrality. NATO planners would have taken this expectation into account,
                    including an assessment of how effective Austrian resistance might be under two
                    different circumstances, one being military action by neighboring Warsaw Pact
                    countries without direct Soviet participation and the other with Soviet
                    participation. I'm sure the assessment of Austrian effectiveness would have been
                    very different in those two cases. But as far as I know there was no
                    coordination between Austrian plans to resist and NATO plans, nor as far as I am
                    aware any NATO plan to defend Austrian territory, although it seems to me in
                    retrospect that it would have been logical for NATO to have at least a
                    contingency plan to hold open the overland link between Italy and Germany via
                    the Austrian Tyrol. If there was such a plan, I certainly never saw it or heard
                    of it in those years from 1961 to 1967.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, the other one was talking about your ambassadors,
                        Riddleberger and MacArthur.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: When I was on the desk, I had Doc Matthews, as I mentioned before. We
                    only had telephone, telegram, and letter correspondence. I never dealt with him
                    face to face. Almost the whole five years I was in Vienna I had Jimmy
                    Riddleberger, who like Matthews was one of our most senior career ambassadors.
                    He was very easy to work with, an absolutely delightful gentleman. He had almost
                    his entire career background in that area. He had been in charge of Central
                    European affairs in the Department, had been ambassador in Yugoslavia and U.S.
                    representative to the Development Assistance Council, OECD, immediately before
                    Vienna. He spoke German fluently, although like most of us learning it as an
                    adult, he had an accent, but his language was perfectly capable to the job. His
                    wife, who was born in Indonesia of Dutch parents, was bilingual in the language.
                    Riddleberger customarily ate lunch in the staff canteen in the basement of the
                    Embassy, frequently with his secretary, Francine Schaevaerts. There were usually
                    two extra places at the table, and if you came in you were very welcome to join
                    them and chat informally. He was very accessible, approachable.</p>
                <p>Shortly after I got there and sized up the situation I decided I was going to
                    take an interest in provincial affairs. Herman Schofield, who was also in the
                    political section, had already staked out the Tyrol and Salzburg ski areas in
                    Austria as he was an enthusiastic skier. He would combine ski trips with calls
                    on the provincial officials in Innsbruck and Salzburg. The rest of the country
                    was up for grabs. As a Political Officer I used to visit them, get acquainted
                    with the provincial officials, governors of the various provinces, party
                    leaders, editors, etc. I started within a few weeks getting out to those areas.
                    Riddleberger, who had arrived a few weeks earlier, was also, as an old time
                    Foreign Service officer, interested in getting acquainted with the rest of the
                    country. I organized visits with Ambassador and Mrs. Riddleberger to several of
                    the provincial capitals. I would spend two or three days at a time with them,
                    and my wife, just the four of us, calling on provincial officials, organizing
                    lunches, dinners, attending receptions given by those governments. I had more
                    informal time with him than one would typically expect of an Ambassador. They
                    were always so easygoing and very nice.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>During Riddleberger's time there, he had one of the best boxes at the Opera
                    House, and he was not personally interested in opera; so the seats in the box
                    were available to the staff on a first-come, first-served basis. My wife and I
                    were both opera fans. While I was on the desk, I had become friendly with the
                    Austrian who ran their cultural information center in New York. Just before I
                    went to Vienna he was transferred back as head of the Austrian Theater
                    Administration, the Bundestheaterverwaltung. So I had an excellent contact to
                    know what was coming up in the Opera, new productions, guest conductors and
                    singers, long before they were ever announced in the newspapers. I would sign up
                    for the box and when the special event was announced, other members of the staff
                    would try to get seats only to find that Sulser already had the box booked! The
                    arrangement was that if you were using it for representational purposes you
                    couldn't be bumped. Otherwise, if you were just going on your own, there was
                    kind of a sharing arrangement. It was understood that nobody would hog the box
                    and even if you had reserved a seat for yourself and your wife, for example, and
                    somebody else came along who hadn't been to the opera as recently or as often as
                    you had, they would ask you to step aside so that they could go. But for those
                    special occasions I always arranged to take Austrian guests for representation
                    purposes so I couldn't be bumped. As a result, we got to the Staatsoper very
                    frequently. The first two years we were there more than 100 times, often more
                    than two or three times in the same week. Riddleberger paid for the box on an
                    annual basis. Once a year he would write a check for the whole thing, which was
                    a very large sum, although prices then were a lot lower than they are today, and
                    the people who used the box would only pay the pro rata cost of the seats. For
                    the kinds of shows I chose to go to, the prices were always elevated because
                    these were special events, new productions, first appearances of some famous
                    singer. But we still paid the same rate every night all year around for the
                    lowest priced performances. So that was a very nice arrangement. I think in the
                    five years I was there with Riddleberger only once did he pre-empt me or anybody
                    else from using the box because he suddenly had a visitor who was interested in
                    going to the Opera.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>When he would entertain a guest, just for a drink or something, to have a
                    one-on-one conversation with some Austrian official as opposed to a big
                    reception or dinner party at his residence, he was hesitant to ask people to
                    come out to the Embassy residence in Hietzing, because it was out on the edge of
                    town by Sch�nbrunn Palace. So he would use one of the apartments above the
                    consulate, which was occupied by Ray Jones, a male secretary who had been with
                    me in Duesseldorf and Vienna, initially as secretary to the chief of the
                    political section. Then Ray moved up to be secretary to the DCM, which he
                    remained the rest of the time in Vienna. Ray was famous in the Foreign Service
                    for his art collection, his furniture, rugs and so on. He had a beautiful
                    apartment, beautifully furnished. Riddleberger would use it to entertain people.
                    Just an illustration of what an easy person he was to work for, and very
                    likeable. But then his term expired and he came back to chair a career minister
                    promotion panel for his last duty before retirement. He made a name for himself
                    even in that respect. When the promotions to career minister were announced, he
                    penned a letter to the Foreign Service Journal protesting because someone was
                    promoted who had not been recommended by the panel. He and his board had
                    enforced the rules at the time, that to be eligible for promotion to career
                    minister you had to have served overseas. There were a few people who were very
                    senior in the Foreign Service as a result of the lateral entry “Wristonization”
                    Program who never had served overseas. Joe Sisco was the person. The Secretary
                    of State insisted that Joe Sisco should be promoted to Career Minister. Sisco
                    was an extremely capable officer and held several top jobs in the Department in
                    U.N. affairs and Near Eastern affairs as assistant secretary in both cases. But
                    the fact was he never had an overseas assignment. Riddleberger felt that rules
                    were rules. The Secretary of State put Sisco's name on the promotion list
                    without the Board having recommended him, and Riddleberger made this fact public
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>After he left there were a lot of rumors about who might come to Austria. Bob
                    Brandin was then the DCM, charg� during the interim. He and I and Ken Sullivan,
                    who was then the labor attach�, were having lunch one day during this period in
                    the staff canteen. Ken is given to very colorful language, a very outspoken
                    fellow. We were discussing these rumors about who our next ambassador was going
                    to be. Ken said, “Well, I don't give a ___ who it is as long as it isn't that
                    *@*@*@ Douglas MacArthur.” Brandin looked at him and said, “If you're going to
                    say things like that, I guess I better tell you that we have received a request
                    for agr�ment (from the Austrian government, which of course hadn't been
                    announced, was still a secret because they didn't have the Austrian reply yet)
                    “for MacArthur.”</p>
                <p>In due course we heard lots of stories about him and his wife, one of them from
                    the wife of the British ambassador in Austria, who had been the British
                    ambassador in the Philippines when MacArthur was ambassador to Japan. This good
                    woman told my wife at a British Embassy party that they were saddened to hear
                    that they were going to be in contact with the MacArthurs again, because when
                    they were out there in the Pacific the Ocean was not big enough for the two of
                    them even though they were not in the same country. People tell stories about
                    the MacArthurs much more freely than I would expect. Much more freely than
                    normal gossip.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did he operate and what were the problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: He was ambassador in Belgium when he was named to Austria. He had no
                    background in the area, no knowledge of German. When we got a message from him
                    about his arrival, they were taking the train from Brussels to Salzburg but
                    wanted the Ambassador's car and driver to meet them in Salzburg instead of going
                    all the way to Vienna on the train. The Ambassador's car was to be equipped
                    permanently with a cooler to be kept stocked with a certain brand of champagne
                    for Mrs. MacArthur. The cooler was to be maintained in the car, supplied with
                    this brand of champagne at all times. When she was calling on foreign
                    ambassador's wives or cabinet members' wives or going shopping or whatever, this
                    brand of champagne was to be available in the car.</p>
                <p>After they got established, she would occasionally have Embassy wives in for
                    coffee. Coffee and orange juice and so on would be served to the wives, except
                    Mrs. MacArthur who drank only this champagne.</p>
                <p>As far as how he operated, with Riddleberger the regular Embassy staff meetings
                    were such as I have experienced at other posts, where you go around the table
                    and each one says what he is doing or what he is about to do, and the ambassador
                    comments, gives guidance, reacts, whatever, to these things. The ambassador
                    might also have something to say. But with MacArthur it was very different. We
                    still had the regular weekly staff meetings, with most of the American staff
                    there, but they were all lectures. He did all the talking. It would be based on
                    information telegrams from the Department. Based on his experience as counselor
                    of the Department, ambassador in Japan, ambassador in Belgium, he had a very
                    wide-ranging experience, and he would educate us about the significance and
                    implications of what was going on around the world. By the time he would finish
                    his lecture it was already overtime and hardly ever was it necessary for anybody
                    to say what he was doing yesterday or today or planning to do tomorrow as far as
                    U.S. activities in Austria were concerned.</p>
                <p>Another request of a personal nature he made when he arrived, he wanted to be
                    outfitted with a proper hunting costume. This was one of his interests. He
                    wanted to go hunting chamois in the Austrian mountains. I knew the largest
                    clothing manufacturer in Austria socially, and we were very friendly with them.
                    So I said, well I can take care of that, this factory manufactures every kind of
                    clothing. I arranged for the Ambassador to go to the head of this firm and be
                    measured for a proper Gamsjaeger outfit, which had to be in certain traditional
                    colors. He got that done.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Since he did not speak German, when he would make his calls on Austrian
                    officials, Ken Sullivan and I (the two best German-speakers in the Embassy)
                    would alternate going with him on his calls. In my case, since I only overlapped
                    with him for six weeks, was not very many. Ken was there at least a year, so he
                    had a great deal more of that duty to do. It was a very different sort of
                    atmosphere, a different relationship. He was much more formal than Riddleberger,
                    much less approachable. He was even a little bit formidable. Not as much fun to
                    work for. But my experience with him was brief and I was not very unhappy about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to Washington in 1967 and went to the
                        War College for a year. Is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, I went to the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in
                    Montgomery, Alabama. I was informed in Vienna that I had been selected for
                    senior training. This was of interest to me, having been in a previous
                    incarnation chief of the training assignments branch and the secretary of the
                    senior selection panel. So I was pleased to find that I had been selected. They
                    didn't announce for some time which school I was going to. From my previous
                    contacts with the senior training system, I had the impression that the National
                    War College and the Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service Institute were the two
                    best, and of the service colleges, army, navy, and air, that the Naval War
                    College was probably the best. Since my wife came from Massachusetts and the
                    Naval War College is located in New London, Connecticut, I was hoping it would
                    be that. Secondly, the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, because that
                    was fairly convenient to Washington and to my family in Illinois and my wife's
                    family in Massachusetts. The least desirable from that standpoint was the Air
                    War College in Alabama, because that didn't relate to anything that fit with me
                    and my family. But that's what it turned out to be. And it was, on a personal
                    basis, a thoroughly enjoyable experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>One of our neighbors and close friends in Alexandria during our first Washington
                    assignment was the administrative assistant to Senator Sparkman. During the time
                    that we were neighbors Helen and I would often be invited to functions where
                    Sparkman was more or less obliged to take a whole table at various fund-raising
                    affairs and things at which the President would often appear or participate, and
                    some tickets would come down to us, so we were often in the presence of the
                    Sparkmans, knew the family, that sort of thing. When we came back and my friend
                    Lou Odum found that we were going to Alabama, where he came from and also the
                    Senator, of course, he said, “Oh, well, you must let me fix you up with some
                    friends in Montgomery.” So he proceeded not just to give me a list of names and
                    addresses but to call these people and say, “My friends the Sulsers are coming
                    down there and I want you to look after them.” They were politicians, lawyers,
                    that sort of thing; Lou is a lawyer himself and he had friends in the legal
                    profession and politics down there, including a couple of members of George
                    Wallace's cabinet, since Wallace was governor. So we had an unusual time there,
                    and in several respects it was almost like a foreign assignment. It was a part
                    of the country that was foreign to us, and in addition to the activities at the
                    War College, the lectures, the associations we had there, getting to know
                    military students from all the services and civilians from other government
                    departments and a few foreigners too, because there were British, Canadian, and
                    Australian officers at the War College in those days, we had these local
                    contacts as well. I would go around calling on these people just as I would call
                    on contacts in overseas posts. It gave me an insight into southern politics,
                    southern hospitality...</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULSER: That's right, we had a few demonstrations and things there. The Selma
                    march, things like that. I had as part of my duties in Vienna, as I had at other
                    posts too, in London and in Duesseldorf, been involved in nominating people for
                    the Leader Grant Program, the international visitors program. Politicians that
                    we expected to become even more important in the future. Some of those I had
                    proposed while I was in Vienna came to the United States on their trips while we
                    were in Alabama. They included Montgomery on their itinerary because we were
                    there. One of them was a man who was minister of education and head of the
                    Socialist Party in the province of Styria. He was very interested in seeing the
                    higher education system in the United States and of course in the South, the
                    “separate but equal” system. While he was in Montgomery he visited Alabama
                    State, which was the Black college located in Montgomery. I set up a dinner
                    party for him with some of these local politicians, and he said he was surprised
                    and impressed by what he saw at Alabama State because it was better than any
                    university in Austria had to offer. He had expected it would be deficient in
                    resources and facilities and such, but he found it to be a first-rate higher
                    learning institution.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at the War College did you...I mean the
                        Vietnam War was really at its height, a lot of it air. Two questions, how
                        did they view somebody from the State Department and the Vietnam War and the
                        other one was, did you find an Air Force state of mind that “air power can
                        settle things?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Absolutely. That is the official doctrine of the Air Force and the motto
                    of the Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base, of which the War College is the
                    topmost part. But they also have their command and staff college and their
                    company grade officer course down there. Most of the academic programs, that is
                    the in-service academic programs, are conducted there, and their purpose and
                    motto is to demonstrate the decisive importance of air power, and to make of
                    their students advocates of air power.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>But as an ex-World War II infantryman who was on the ground both in combat and as
                    a POW in Germany, underneath the air raids, I was not so impressed with air
                    power and had a good many lively discussions with my Air Force fellow students.
                    Just as I did in college after the war talking with other veterans of World War
                    II, many of whom had been in the Army Air Corps. I had digested the strategic
                    bombing survey and used to quote quite readily from that, that indicated among
                    other things that German war production continued to increase right up until
                    March of 1945, only a couple of months before the war was over. German war
                    production diminished after that only because the Air Corps declared that they
                    had destroyed all the war production facilities in Germany and reluctantly
                    turned their attention to hitting the trains and other elements of the
                    transportation system in Germany and it was only then, when the output of the
                    various factories could not get together to make the finished product that there
                    finally were fewer airplanes, fewer tanks. Every Friday morning there at the Air
                    War College we would have a big briefing on what the Air Force had done that
                    week in Vietnam. Rolling Thunder was the big campaign, the B-29s flying out of
                    Okinawa, the Philippines, wherever they were coming from, and dropping tens of
                    thousands of tons of bombs on Ho Chi Minh trail. We'd get statistics on the
                    tonnage that had been expended that week and that sort of thing. Occasionally
                    they would show comparisons with World War II that demonstrated that many times
                    the amount of ordnance was being expended in Vietnam as had been expended during
                    World War II. And still the war seemed to be going against us all the time. I
                    was there during the Tet Offensive, and we had speakers from Washington, from
                    JCS and other parts of the Pentagon and the National Security establishment in
                    Washington about the hundreds of thousands of additional troops that were
                    necessary to accomplish the mission. It impacted on the personal level too,
                    because the Air Force element of the student body, which being the Air War
                    College was of course the largest part of the student body, was much smaller
                    than it had been because McNamara said we can conduct the Vietnam War and all of
                    our other activities without having recourse to a draft and without expanding
                    pilot training, because statistically his systems analysts showed that the Air
                    Force had all the pilots they needed to do all this stuff. Well, they were all
                    needed in Vietnam and we had very few pilots at the Air War College. About the
                    only pilots we had were a few people who had come off attach� duty in other
                    countries, or off of desk jobs in the Pentagon, many of whom had not flown
                    combat aircraft in years, and they were just about the only Air Force pilots we
                    had. We had an airfield that was full of airplanes, but every time we had to go
                    somewhere as a student body, they had to bring in National Guard squadrons or
                    Air Reserve squadrons to fly us there because there were no Air Force pilots in
                    the student body. When we would make study trips, to Washington, for example to
                    do research, planes were available but they were flown by the Navy, and Coast
                    Guard and Army pilots who were in the student body there. The Air Force
                    component of the student body was much smaller than usual and those that were
                    coming out of non-flying jobs to attend there, every one of them had to go at
                    the end of this course to Vietnam into a combat flying situation. All the
                    students were full colonels or lieutenant colonels. Some of them had been in
                    teaching assignments at the Air Academy in Colorado Springs or desk jobs in
                    Washington, intelligence activities, for years, and had barely done enough
                    flying to maintain their flight pay. Now they were going to have to go out there
                    and fly combat missions as a colonel, a wingman, to some guy who is actually
                    junior to him but had more combat experience; and a number of them perished when
                    they got to Vietnam. They all, of course, had to go to reorientation, or
                    refresher, courses after War College to get a couple of weeks experience on an
                    F-4 when they had never flown anything hotter than a C-47 before. It was, from
                    the personal standpoint, a very sad situation, particularly for the flying
                    officers there. We had a lot of administrative people, logisticians, missile
                    engineers, but pilots were in very short supply.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you were assigned where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Since I had served only in Western Europe, the Personnel people told me
                    policy called for me to be assigned to another area; and since I had been in
                    subordinate positions abroad, in order to be promoted to senior rank—I was then
                    an old-style FSO-3—that I would need to have some executive management
                    experience. They were recommending that I be assigned as DCM in a small African
                    Embassy. This would give me both management experience and the out-of-Europe
                    experience. That was fine with me. But when it came time for assignments in the
                    spring of 1968, the African Bureau decided to abolish the DCM position in many
                    of those small embassies. They couldn't afford to have a full-time deputy chief
                    of mission as well as all the functional jobs. So much of the category of
                    positions for which the career counselors had said I should be considered
                    suddenly disappeared. Unlike my Personnel experience, when placement had been
                    centralized in the office of Personnel, we were then in a phase when assignments
                    had been decentralized again and were effectively determined in the geographic
                    and functional bureaus. I got a call one day at Maxwell from the personnel
                    officer in the European Bureau, Dudley Miller, who said he understood I was
                    still available for assignment, and would I be interested in going back to
                    London as political officer. I told him that while I would not seek any job in
                    the Embassy in London, that London was a place I would never be able to turn
                    down. In any case, I was not offered any alternatives. I learned later that Bill
                    Galloway, with whom I had worked in Personnel and indirectly replaced in Vienna,
                    was then deputy chief of the London political section and had requested my
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>So I went from the Air War College back to London for a second assignment, this
                    time in the Political Section rather than the Consular Section. My principal
                    duties were to cover the Labor and Liberal parties, and I was also to deal with
                    the Foreign Office on Western European affairs, particularly Germany. I had
                    various other internal political duties. I was the biographic officer and I was
                    responsible for devolution, which was then a lively political subject in
                    Britain. That was the effort to try and give Scotland, Wales, and Northern
                    Ireland a little more autonomy from the central government. It didn't go very
                    far. I also dealt with the Northern Ireland office. Shortly after I got there,
                    that area exploded in the spell of “troubles” that lasted until now.</p>

                <p>SULSER: Harold Wilson was Prime Minister, Labor, and when I went there David
                    Bruce was Ambassador and Phillip Kaiser was the minister, the DCM. Kaiser had
                    gone to Oxford with a number of people in the Cabinet, including Defense
                    Minister Denis Healey and Home Secretary Jim Callaghan. He had also gone to
                    school with Ted Heath, who was then Leader of the Conservative opposition.
                    Kaiser was very generous in introducing me to Callaghan and Healey and a good
                    many others. I mentioned earlier that my mother had gone to High School with a
                    man who was labor attach� in London during my first assignment. He had
                    introduced me to a number of his trade union friends, one of whom at the time
                    was number two in the Transport and General Workers Union. When I went back the
                    second time, he had become General Secretary of the Labor Party, the top
                    functionary. So I, too, had a longstanding contact and had stayed in touch with
                    this gentleman. He introduced me to all of his subordinates in Labor Party
                    headquarters, so I was off to a good start. I proceeded to build relationships
                    with the British Labor Party officials and also with the Liberal Party. I went
                    to their conferences and other meetings, spent long hours in their offices and
                    in Parliament, entertained them and was entertained by them.</p>

                        the Vietnam War, and the Labor Party at that time had a very strong
                        left-wing element to it, which obviously was not delighted about our
                        involvement in the War, and also I take it was not fully behind NATO. Maybe
                        I'm wrong, but how did you find that element of the Labor Party and what was
                        our policy towards them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The Labor government, up until shortly before I went there in 1968 had
                    been strongly supporting the U.S. effort, but they had backed off. There were
                    very few in the top levels of the Labor Party by that time who would speak
                    publicly or write in support of U.S. policy. Most of them were still sympathetic
                    in private, and I guess their contribution to the Alliance then was keeping
                    their mouths shut about their objections and letting the left fringe of the
                    Labor Party do all the yakking on the subject. George Brown, who had been Deputy
                    Leader of the Party, Minister of Economic Affairs and Foreign Minister, was one
                    of the few who still would speak in the House of Commons or elsewhere,
                    sympathetically about the U.S. and there were one or two Labor back-benchers who
                    would speak in favor. I annoyed Ambassador Annenberg once in staff meeting by
                    lamenting that only “has-beens” like Brown were still willing to speak out for
                    us. He hoped that Brown's once great promise might still be realized, but it was
                    my assessment that he was no longer going higher in the Labor Party and not
                    mainly because of Vietnam. I would have to say nine-tenths of the words uttered
                    or written by people in the Labor Party about Vietnam at that time were critical
                    of U.S. actions. There were plenty of demonstrations with thousands of people
                    jamming into Grosvenor Square in front of the Embassy, and...</p>

                <p>SULSER: That's right, he was at Oxford at that time and, yes, we learned recently
                    that he was apparently in the crowd. And hundreds and hundreds of policemen, of
                    course. I would often go out and circulate on the fringes of those
                    demonstrations just to get a personal impression of the kinds of people that
                    were there and make some assessment of how organized these things were, how well
                    they were led. On the fringes there were bands of skin-heads roaming around who
                    would pick off stray demonstrators and beat them and kick them. I saw that
                    happen. I don't think those skin-heads were supporting the U.S. in Vietnam, they
                    were just taking an opportunity to beat up on the kinds of people, long-haired
                    hippy types that they were in general opposed to. It was an interesting and
                    exciting time to be there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem with...I mean if they were speaking
                        out against us, the War and all, what was the feeling in the Embassy and
                        what was our policy, just to say well this is the way it is, pro forma
                        protests, or explanations, or, how did you deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, I think that puts it as well as it could be. We did not have any
                    trouble with the British government as such or with the Conservative opposition.
                    The Embassy in general and USIS in particular tried to provide background
                    articles about our policy in Vietnam and what we were attempting to do there,
                    what our objectives and purposes were, the progress that was being made on
                    pacification and all that kind of business. All the favorable aspects of our
                    public policies to make those available to journalists, politicians and so on.
                    We provided speakers whenever requested. But for the most part it was just
                    something that you had to live through and survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues that you were involved in at the
                        time aside from Vietnam, or were things on a pretty even keel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The Labor government's program to reduce the British military presence in
                    the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia, we were constantly arguing against
                    and trying to get them to maintain a healthy influence in those areas. We were
                    accustomed to having them involved there, and we hated to see it diminish. We
                    realized that their economic situation was such that they couldn't afford to
                    maintain everything as it had been, but we kept hoping they would find ways to
                    continue as much as they could. Their cooperation with us in those areas was
                    very close. To some extent we were being sucked into the vacuum they were
                    leaving so there was always a lot of coordination involved, using their
                    facilities, taking over their facilities in some cases, using their presence and
                    longstanding influence to assist us in negotiations with the host governments.
                    The political-military cooperation was very close and extensive.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>As far as Europe was concerned, there was the problem of the European Economic
                    Community vs. the European Free Trade area, and the evolving British policy of
                    European integration, the British role in Europe, which we had always hoped
                    would continue to be a heavy one. We were also working on a new 4-power
                    arrangement for Berlin. We always had close cooperation in the so-called Bonn
                    Group, representatives of the U.S., British, and French embassies, with the
                    German government involved, regarding the presence of foreign troops, German
                    participation in NATO, and the status of Berlin. Occasionally the Bonn Group
                    would escalate into the Ambassadorial Group, on which we were represented by the
                    Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, Martin Hillenbrand, an old German
                    hand. One of these Ambassador Group meetings took place regarding Berlin while I
                    was in London. I was the Embassy backstopper for that, since relations with that
                    part of the British Foreign Office was in my portfolio. Jonathan Dean was the
                    political counselor at our Embassy in Bonn and our representative on the Bonn
                    Group. If you've had any dealings with Jock Dean, you know he is one of the most
                    prolific reporters the Foreign Service has ever had. His reports of these Bonn
                    meetings were always voluminous. They would be copied to the Embassy in London,
                    and I would run over to the Foreign Office with them. Invariably, they would get
                    reports of the Bonn Group meetings from me faster than they would from the
                    British Embassy in Bonn. Even when they got the reports from their
                    representatives in Bonn, they would be only a tenth as long and detailed as the
                    reports I could supply them by Jock Dean.</p>
                <p>When they had the higher level meeting in London with Marty Hillenbrand, Jock
                    came over from Bonn to participate and suggested that we divide the reportorial
                    duties. I did half the day and he would do half the day. I did the mornings and
                    would go back to the Embassy and dictate what seemed to me a very long and
                    detailed account of what had transpired. He would come in after the afternoon
                    session and dictate several times as much. Then he would look over what I had
                    done and add at least 50% more to what I had written. He was really phenomenal
                    in that respect. Although he took some notes, they were by no means verbatim,
                    and his reconstruction of the discussions was as close to verbatim as you could
                    hope to get. Those discussions culminated shortly thereafter in the new 4-power
                    Berlin arrangement that altered the situation considerably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what manner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The relationship between Bonn and Berlin, between the Allied military
                    commands and diplomatic missions in Berlin, access to the Soviet Zone in East
                    Berlin, and protection for Soviet facilities in West Berlin. Many of the things
                    that had been argued about over the 25 years since the War were then at least
                    regularized.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Personally, during the whole three and a half years there, my time in grade in 03
                    since 1963 was getting longer, and I was concerned about my future. I was again
                    in a subordinate political position, and Personnel kept telling me that to get
                    promoted to Senior grades I would need to get some management position. I kept
                    telling them, Fine, I didn't ask to come here any more than I asked to stay five
                    years in Vienna. Finally, one day I got a telephone call saying, “You really
                    mean you're available to leave London?” I said, “Yes, I've been saying that ever
                    since I got here.” They said, “Okay, we're going to assign you as charg� in
                    Niamey.” I said, “Fine, that's okay with me.” I proceeded to get the post report
                    and make arrangements to put our kids in boarding school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Niamey is where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: It's in Niger, the former French colony just north of Nigeria, on the
                    edge of the Sahara Desert, on the Niger River. I got the post report, which was
                    very interesting reading and started to brush up what little French I had, and
                    made arrangements to put the children in boarding school. A week later I got
                    another call from Personnel saying, “Sorry, we're going to have to cancel that
                    assignment because the Medical Division would not let your wife go there.” Just
                    before we left Vienna in '67 she had some sort of medical problem that at first
                    was thought to be a heart attack but then decided it was not, it was some sort
                    of circulatory problem. Anyhow, the Medical Division said she could only go
                    places with adequate medical facilities and that did not include Niamey. That
                    was as close as I ever got to being assigned outside Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The Assistant Secretary for Administration at the time, Frank Meyer, had been one
                    of our Admin Officers in Vienna. Frank came to London regularly with Congressman
                    Rooney who was Chairman of the State Subcommittee of the House Appropriations
                    Committee. Frank Meyer had a bag of money to pay Rooney's bills as he went
                    along, and look after him otherwise and try to cajole him into approving
                    whatever expenditure Rooney's staff had told him should be dropped from the
                    State Department budget. Frank, in his position, was able to see Selection Board
                    lists, and he would tell me, “Oh yes, you've climbed up, you're within the
                    promotion range.” When I got into the promotion range to make FSO-2, it was the
                    year the budget was such that they only promoted a half dozen people into class
                    02, so that didn't work. Finally, after having made known to everyone I was
                    aware of in the system back in Washington that I was available, I was not wedded
                    to staying in London the rest of my life, I got a direct transfer to Frankfurt
                    as Deputy Principal Officer. I have to credit that to the late Elwood Williams,
                    who was Mr. Continuity on the German desk for many, many years. Ever since my
                    days as Political Officer in Duesseldorf, in the mid-'50s, Elwood had kept track
                    not only of me but of anybody else who ever did political reporting out of
                    Germany, kept track of their careers, and if he thought you did good work and
                    had a contribution to make he would try to get appropriate assignments for you.
                    He called to tell me that he had proposed to assign me back to Duesseldorf as
                    Principal Officer, but that was a senior position and there were other senior
                    officers with German experience who needed assignments. I didn't get that, but
                    he was able to get me assigned to Frankfurt as Deputy Principal Officer by
                    selling me to Bob Harlan, the Consul General there. I went on direct transfer in
                    January of '72.</p>
                <p>Before I left London I got a letter from Bob Harlan welcoming me to the post and
                    describing what he wanted me to do, delegating certain areas of responsibility
                    so that I would clearly have some supervisory and management responsibilities. I
                    was not only to do the political work, but I was to supervise the Consular and
                    Administrative sections and manage the very active junior officer rotation
                    program they have in Frankfurt. He was giving parties to introduce me to various
                    elements of the community in Frankfurt and had accepted on my behalf invitations
                    that had come in even before I got there. When I looked at that list, I saw that
                    virtually every night for the first month was occupied with parties of one kind
                    or another. I thought, well, okay, this is my initial period, and it's going to
                    slow down and be more normal, such as I had experienced elsewhere in the Foreign
                    Service: that is, a couple of times a week you're either giving a party or
                    you're invited to more or less official, representational activities. As it
                    turned out, the social schedule got only heavier as the years went on in
                    Frankfurt. It was far and away the busiest post I have ever experienced in that
                    respect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would that be so? Frankfurt is basically a commercial
                        area. The politics there are interesting but not of earthshaking consequence
                        to our policy in Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>SULSER: Well, not earthshaking in terms of German—U.S. relations, but the
                    provincial governments in Germany have a great deal more influence than, say, in
                    Austria or England, the other countries I was familiar with. Not only do the
                    representatives of the provincial governments make up the Upper House in Bonn,
                    but the national governments draw on people from those provincial governments
                    for Cabinet positions and elsewhere. We had three Laender in our consular
                    district: Hesse, Rhineland-Pfalz and the Saarland, which meant some political
                    travel and representational activity to deal with three Laender governments. We
                    also had a quarter of a million U.S. forces in our consular district, which
                    provided not only a lot of consular work, registering births of children born to
                    our forces in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was baby-birth officer at some point, I think it was in
                        '57, and I think I registered about 300 a month.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Oh yes, it's a heavy duty, and the issuance of passports to our forces in
                    Germany. In addition to that consular work, it involves a lot of dealing with
                    the host communities, not only Laender but also municipal officials all over
                    that part of Germany in the interest of maintaining a good atmosphere for our
                    troops. By the time I was there, from January '72 until September of '75, there
                    was frequent friction between local authorities and U.S. forces because of the
                    growing need for housing and other facilities in Germany, with their growing
                    population, expanding economy, and our holding on to vast training areas and
                    airfields and barracks and storehouses. As you know, we keep the equipment for
                    several divisions of troops to rush over from the U.S., that takes up vast areas
                    in Rhineland-Pfalz and Saarland, all those airfields and stuff all over the
                    place. We were constantly having to deal with these community relations problems
                    occasioned by our very large troop presence in Germany.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>The other element you referred to, the very large business community. This is the
                    center of American business in Germany. The headquarters of the American Chamber
                    of Commerce for Germany. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of American
                    companies, some of them large manufacturing plants, such as Opel, owned by
                    General Motors, but many, many small companies. The business community was
                    growing by leaps and bounds while I was there, with American banks coming in.
                    Although Bob Harlan reserved to himself the management of the
                    economic-commercial activities in the Consulate, there was still plenty of
                    personal involvement on the social level for the Deputy Principal Officer. And
                    then too, the huge consulate staff. When I went there in 1972, I was told by the
                    Department that there were only ten U.S. embassies in the world larger than the
                    Consulate in Frankfurt. One of those was Saigon, which closed while I was there,
                    so I would assume there were nine embassies left in the world that had more
                    people on the staff than the Consulate General in Frankfurt. While much of that
                    staff was due to other agencies that were located there for two reasons—one
                    because we had housing for them, as originally it was assumed that Frankfurt was
                    going to be the headquarters of Western Germany, until Adenauer decided
                    otherwise, so we had a very large housing area that was no longer needed just
                    for the consulate staff. But it's also the communications and transportation
                    center for Germany, so it was a very convenient place for other agencies to
                    establish. The Federal Aviation Administration had a large staff there of 40 or
                    so people with three aircraft kept out at Rhein Main Air Base. Their job was to
                    maintain the navigation and communications facilities for U.S. Air Force in
                    Europe, but also to monitor the navigational facilities used by U.S. civilian
                    airlines all over the Middle East and Africa, as well. They flew aircraft to
                    Berlin, England, all over West Germany and the rest of Europe, down to Greece
                    and the Middle East, etc., in order to certify to U.S. airlines and the Air
                    Force that navigational facilities were calibrated properly and functioning. The
                    General Accounting Office had a staff of 50 or so there to do their thing all
                    over the Middle East, Europe and Africa. The State Department Courier Operation
                    maintains one of their two large overseas operations, one in Bangkok and one in
                    Frankfurt, again with 40 or 50 diplomatic couriers based there traveling all
                    over the Middle East, Europe and Africa. Other U.S. agencies of a smaller
                    nature, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs Bureau, Immigration Service
                    had two or three officers there and a local staff. It was a very, very large
                    government community, and the business community, and the military community, as
                    well as German officialdom and politicians that were of interest to us. It kept
                    us very busy. At the end of the first year I went through my calendar and found
                    that we had averaged something like 5.3 nights a week involved in social
                    activities. When I realized that, I made a point of keeping track every year;
                    and every year it went up by a tenth of a point or two. By the time we left, it
                    was virtually six nights a week we were busy, either entertaining or, more
                    often, being entertained by different people, and very often two or three
                    different functions in a given evening. Shortly after arriving in Frankfurt, I
                    was promoted to 0-2 after nine years in grade, one year short of maximum time in
                    class. Three years later, in 1975, I was promoted to 0-1.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I felt that my major contribution was in cultivating close contacts with
                    politicians who later became more than they were when I was there. The head of
                    the Christian Democratic Party from Land Hessen at the time, Alfred Dregger, was
                    mayor of Fulda. I visited him in Fulda, had him in my home and visited with him
                    in the Landtag at Wiesbaden. He later became Chairman of the Christian
                    Democratic faction in the Bundestag. Helmut Kohl was minister-president of
                    Rhineland-Pfalz. I became acquainted with him and he became head of the
                    Christian Democratic Party, their Chancellor-candidate, and of course has been
                    Chancellor for a good many years now. People in the Embassy didn't know him, and
                    we got Ambassador Hillenbrand to come down to the Carnival parade in Mainz one
                    year, mainly to meet Kohl, because Kohl always used to invite us to observe the
                    Carnival parade with him. When he became Chancellor-candidate, I said to his
                    chief of staff, whom I was very friendly with, “But he has no experience in
                    foreign affairs, he's been a provincial politician all his life. Who is he going
                    to have to inform and advise him on world affairs?” And he said, “As a matter of
                    fact he has hired a young man out of one of the southern German university think
                    tanks named Horst Teltchik to be his foreign affairs adviser.” So I said, “Okay,
                    then I have to meet Horst Teltchik.” I arranged a lunch with Teltchik and we
                    became very close; when Kohl became Chancellor, Teltchik became in effect his
                    national security adviser. Before I left Frankfurt I saw to it that Teltchik was
                    introduced to one of the political officers at our Embassy in Bonn, which had
                    had no contact with him up to that point. The head of the Socialist Party in
                    Saarland, Lafontaine, I became acquainted with, cultivated him, and he became
                    the Chancellor-candidate of the Socialist Party through a couple of elections,
                    unsuccessful for them. That is the sort of thing, the contribution political
                    contacts at provincial levels can make, to develop a pattern of contact, get
                    acquainted with these people, write reports about them, do biographic
                    assessments. When Kohl was making his first visit to Washington, I was then
                    assigned in the Pentagon, and the person responsible for preparing psychological
                    evaluations for the President tracked me down having looked in the records to
                    read up on Kohl, people who had sent in memcons or biographic reports on him,
                    and found me! I was the one who had written most about him, about his
                    personality, his interests, his characteristics, and he tracked me down in the
                    Pentagon and spent hours interviewing me in connection with a psychological
                    assessment of Kohl for the President's use in his first meeting with Kohl as
                    Chancellor. Those things we can do. But you're right, we were not negotiating
                    any big U.S.-German deals or anything.</p>

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SULSER: September, 1975, yes. The year before, in 1974, I was borrowed by the
                    Inspection Corps. Ken Sullivan, who I mentioned earlier was with me in
                    Duesseldorf and Vienna, was then in the Inspection Corps, was due to go out on
                    an inspection team and at the last moment decided to take leave. Jim Sutterlin
                    was then Inspector General and called Bob Harlan in Frankfurt and asked if he
                    would let me go on detail to fill out this inspection team. Bob said fine, if
                    Jack is willing and interested in doing that. Then Sutterlin called me, and I
                    said, “Sure, as long as Bob okays it, it's fine with me.” I didn't participate
                    in the briefing of the inspection team in Washington. I went directly from
                    Frankfurt to Beirut and joined the team there, inspected the Embassy in Beirut,
                    the Consulate General in Jerusalem, the Embassy in Tel Aviv and the embassies in
                    Amman and Damascus. I was gone about two and a half months, the only official
                    duty I was ever called on to perform outside of Europe. I found it a very
                    interesting experience, but professionally a frustrating one, because it seemed
                    to me the Department was expecting the inspectors to do more than they were
                    capable of doing: to put themselves in the place of the policy formulators in
                    Washington, from the President, National Security Council, Secretary of State on
                    down. The inspectors were supposed to go in and evaluate whether U.S. policy and
                    objectives were appropriate and realistic, whether the resources devoted to
                    achieve those objectives were adequate, and so on. When I was leaving Frankfurt
                    a year later, Bill Schaufele was Inspector General, whom I had also known in the
                    past. He called and said he wanted to assign me as a senior inspector to head an
                    inspection team full time. I asked him if the program was the same as the year
                    before and said I didn't think inspectors from various backgrounds were really
                    in a position to second-guess the policy makers in Washington. If that was still
                    to be the principle objective of the inspections, I didn't feel I could do this
                    adequately. So that offered assignment didn't materialize. Later I got a call
                    from Bob Houghton, who had been my career counselor way back in 1955 when I came
                    on home leave from Vienna; he was now the chief of the senior officer
                    assignments branch in Personnel and wanted me to join him as his deputy. That's
                    what I did my second time in Personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there '75 to '77. How did the Senior Officer
                        assignment system work in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>SULSER: I kept comparing it with my previous experience in Personnel, 1958-'61,
                    when Personnel authority was centralized and I had gotten a lot of satisfaction
                    out of realizing I was doing something that mattered in the Foreign Service and
                    participating in group decisions that in nine cases out of ten, or maybe even 95
                    out of 100, actually determined assignments. When I came back to Personnel in
                    1975, they had just launched what has been known ever since as the Open
                    Assignments System. Personnel was organized on a different basis, by ranks; a
                    junior officer branch, a mid-career branch, and a senior assignments branch. We
                    dealt only with senior officers; in my previous experience, a geographic branch
                    or the training branch, you would deal with people of all ranks. I found the
                    Open Assignments System, at least as it operated at the senior level, to be
                    ineffective, to say the least, from the standpoint of officers needing
                    assignment and extremely frustrating for the people who were charged with
                    administering it. Perhaps it worked better at the junior or mid-career levels, I
                    really couldn't tell. The placement panel I had enjoyed so much, the give and
                    take during my previous assignment there, functioned entirely differently. The
                    assignments were determined outside the panel; the panel was only for the
                    purpose of recording those assignments. You'd just go in and say, “We are
                    assigning so and so to such and such position.” There was no discussion, no
                    arguing, no rationale, no chance to comment or pick it apart because the other
                    members of the panel dealt with personnel of other ranks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well where was the decision made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The decisions were being made effectively in the bureaus. In the senior
                    assignments branch we were responsible for circulating the lists of vacancies
                    coming up and recording the desires of the officers based on the vacancies
                    coming up in the time they were eligible for transfer. We'd get wish-lists from
                    people based on these lists of pending vacancies. But any time we tried to make
                    assignments on that basis that were not acceptable to the bureaus concerned,
                    they would just run to our higher authorities and say, “Oh, your people want to
                    assign so and so the job, but I want this person.” Which meant the old-boy
                    network was rampant. We talked about that in my earlier PER assignment when you
                    questioned the extent of personal involvement and old-boy system that I believe
                    operated at a minimal level in those days. Now it was virtually the entire
                    system at the senior level. It was almost impossible for us to assign someone on
                    the basis of what we thought was a sensible assignment, because the bureau
                    wanted the people they wanted; the people they knew. The assistant secretaries
                    had no hesitation to run to Carol Laise, who was then the Director General of
                    Personnel, and say, “It's impossible for me to operate the bureau unless I have
                    so and so instead of the one your flunkies down the way want to assign.” She had
                    no desire to quarrel with these people; they were her opposite numbers at the
                    top ranks of the Department, and I never knew her to stand by her staff rather
                    than the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been very frustrating.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SULSER: It was, extremely so. About the only thing that was like the old days in
                    Personnel was the fact that this was expected to be only a two-year assignment.
                    At the end of those two years Bob Houghton was leaving, and the head of Foreign
                    Service assignments then, Carl Ackerman, whom I got on very well with, wanted me
                    to stay on as chief of the branch. I said, “No way, thank you; the only reason
                    I've been able to maintain my sanity in this job is that you and Bob Houghton
                    are between me and the top levels. If I had to deal with this face-to-face, I
                    don't think I could take it.”</p>
                <p>In the meantime, we had all these officers coming in who had asked for
                    assignments who were mystified as to why they were never getting anything that
                    they asked for. It was very hard to deal with, to tell your fellow officers that
                    you were powerless to do anything. Not only to give them the jobs that they had
                    expressed an interest in, that were available, but really to give them much of
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would you do? Tell them that they really had to go to
                        the bureau that they were interested in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Finally, if they persisted, you would have to tell them, “Frankly, I
                    think you would be well advised to pursue your interest through the bureaus
                    where you are known. Try it that way.” I could see the list of over-complement
                    officers growing steadily. When I was in Personnel the first time, there were
                    always a few officers who were difficult to place. We would convene a special
                    panel, after normal hours, or at least we would start late in the afternoon and
                    stay until late at night, gather the executive directors of the various bureaus
                    and say, “Look, here is a list of people who need assignments, and we have to
                    assign them.” At the end of that evening, before anybody could leave, that list
                    had to be eliminated. The bureaus knew that they would have to take their fair
                    share of these people. The European Bureau, being the largest, had to take more
                    than anybody else. There were no long-term over-complement officers. But in the
                    Open Assignment System the list of over-complement senior officers kept growing
                    and growing. I got very concerned about this and did a memorandum which passed
                    up the line, about how this had grown from month to month and what the causes of
                    it were. In addition to the one I mentioned—inability to assign people—it was
                    obvious that one of the principle causes was the so-called “stretch” assignment,
                    where the bureaus were not only asking for senior officers of their choice to
                    fill these posts, but were moving mid-career officers into senior positions, so
                    that there were fewer and fewer senior vacancies available. Well, my memo had
                    little impact. Carl Ackerman told me he had read it with interest, but when he
                    had discussed it with his superiors, they didn't think it was a serious problem.
                    About a year later, after I had left Personnel, I got a call from Carl Ackerman
                    to say my memorandum had been resurrected and people were now very concerned. I
                    gather the problem has not diminished in the years since then. I keep reading in
                    the Foreign Service Journal and elsewhere about the problem of unassigned senior
                    officers walking the halls, trying to find meaningful work to do on a temporary
                    basis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything we've talked about so far that you
                        wanted to add to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: You had asked me about Austria being an East-West intelligence
                    battleground, and I thought later about one incident when the Austrian
                    government passed a law making it a crime for Austrian citizens to work for
                    foreign intelligence organizations. Within days after that law took effect, all
                    the local employees in our Army and Air Attach� offices got new personnel action
                    forms telling them that they were no longer employed by the Army or Air Force,
                    but by the Defense Intelligence Agency. The defense intelligence system had been
                    reorganized and brought under DIA instead of the individual services. So we had
                    a little flap there, had to straighten it out, since we had just made all our
                    local employees criminals by assigning them to the DIA.</p>
                <p>I was in Vienna when President Kennedy was killed; it was late Friday when we got
                    the news so we decided that a small group of people from each section would get
                    together on Saturday morning in the Embassy at 8:00 to plan how we were going to
                    manage memorials, condolence book and so forth. I got down there at 8:00 on
                    Saturday morning. The Embassy was closed, but there was already a line more than
                    a block long of people wanting to come in and sign a condolence book. That line
                    was headed by the then-President of Austria, Adolf Schaerf, who was standing
                    there in the line waiting to come in the door at 8:00 on a Saturday morning to
                    sign a condolence book. Later, two of the Kennedy sisters, Pat Lawford and Jean
                    Smith came over to Vienna to see the places their brother had been when he was
                    there for the summit with Khrushchev. I had the pleasure of escorting them
                    around for a couple of days, taking them to those places, plus they also wanted
                    to see a school or clinic for retarded children. It was one of the Kennedy
                    family interests as a result of sister Kathleen. I made some inquiries and
                    learned about a very interesting place of that sort and took them there. They
                    were very impressed by it, by the director, the doctor who ran this clinic, an
                    Austrian physician. This clinic became one of the regular institutions supported
                    by the Kennedy Foundation.</p>
                <p>Commenting on the work of an Austrian Desk Officer, I told you about the limited
                    extent to which I was involved in the logistical planning for the summit in
                    Vienna, but I never, either as officer in charge of Austrian affairs or deputy
                    chief of the political section afterwards, saw any record of those conversations
                    with Khrushchev until last year when I was reviewing materials at the National
                    Security Council for publication in the Foreign Relations of the U.S. volumes
                    put out by the historian's office. I finally got to read all these memcons of
                    conversations between Khrushchev and Kennedy, 30 years later.</p>

                <p>SULSER: We were talking last time, I think when the tape was not running, about
                    the lack of a send-off in the Foreign Service when you leave. If you are being
                    sworn in as Ambassador or Assistant Secretary, they have a very nice ceremony,
                    the family comes and your friends are invited and they have the chief of
                    protocol giving you the oath and all this kind of stuff. But when you leave the
                    Foreign Service, no one even says good-bye or thank you or anything. I think for
                    the most part you have to get your satisfaction out of various things that
                    happened, that you did, or the experiences you had. For me, as I've mentioned
                    before, one of the most satisfying things was getting to know people at an early
                    stage of their career, recognizing them as people with potential, and then
                    seeing that happen. The satisfaction that you get from knowing that you knew the
                    prime minister, the foreign minister, the president, whatever, when he was a
                    young person about your own age. That certainly happened to me in England,
                    Germany, Austria, and to a lesser extent in Holland; I suppose because that was
                    my last overseas post and I was senior myself, so the people I dealt with were
                    already senior. But in Austria, for example, where my major responsibility was
                    covering the Austrian Socialist Party and developing contacts there, among the
                    very good friends I spent time with, not just on duty but on weekends and
                    traveling, going around to wine cellars and restaurants very informally, was the
                    Secretary of the Socialist Party in Burgenland, the easternmost province
                    bordering Hungary, and two young fellows in the Socialist Parliament faction
                    office, a secretary and an assistant secretary of the Socialist group in the
                    National Parliament. And 15 years later the fellow from Burgenland (Sinowatz)
                    was Chancellor, and the former secretary of the National faction (Gratz) was
                    Foreign Minister and his former assistant (Fischer) was the Minister for Science
                    and Research; and they were respectively Chairman and Deputy Chairmen of the
                    Socialist Party. That is a good, fun thing. When I was in Duesseldorf, I read
                    one day that the Catholic Youth Organization had chosen a new chairman. That
                    organization was headquartered in Duesseldorf, so I went around to meet this
                    fellow. Heinrich Koeppler was his name. Fifteen years later he was
                    Minister-President of Rhineland-Westpfalz and the CDU Chancellor-candidate. He
                    told me he remembered me as the first American he ever met. Unfortunately, he
                    died before he could become Chancellor. He was succeeded as Chancellor-candidate
                    by Helmut Kohl.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>In Frankfurt, I noticed one day that the Socialist Youth Organization had elected
                    a new headperson. A woman had had that job before, named Heidi Wieczorek-Seul,
                    she was a wild radical. I never had any dealings with her. She certainly never
                    gave the impression she would be accessible to any Americans at the height of
                    Vietnam and what all. But here was a new person on the scene, so I thought I'd
                    give him a try. It was a clean slate as far as I was concerned. He was very
                    cordial on the telephone, but when I suggested getting together for lunch or
                    coming to see him in his office or something he said, oh no, that his board at
                    the Socialist Youth Organization would never understand his meeting with an
                    American official because of Vietnam. He said he wouldn't mind if I called him
                    on the telephone from time to time. So I had fairly regular telephone
                    conversations with him about things that were going on in Germany and his
                    attitude, about the U.S. etc. After we withdrew from Vietnam in 1975, he was
                    perfectly ready to meet with me and did often. At that time I was running a sort
                    of school for our junior officers and our whole economic-commercial staff, which
                    was our major operation in Frankfurt. We had a Trade Center putting on exhibits
                    for the whole of Germany. Shortly before that the staff had turned over,
                    completely. All the Americans who had been there were old German hands, knew
                    their way around, spoke the language. Suddenly, we had a new crew who had never
                    been in Germany before. So the Director asked if I could run a seminar for his
                    staff to teach them about Germany. I started regular Friday afternoon classes,
                    if you will, not only for the economic-commercial staff but for the first tour
                    junior officers that we always had on a rotation program. After my own series of
                    lectures about the German government, the political parties, the pressure groups
                    that operated in politics there, I started bringing in outside speakers,
                    including the head of the Socialist Youth Organization. That was Karsten Voigt,
                    who is now the SPD Foreign Affairs spokesman in the Bundestag. That was another
                    very pleasant experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>In London, in the '68-'72 assignment in the Political Section, there were a
                    couple of things I didn't mention before. A month after Nixon became President
                    in 1969, he came to London. Embassy officers were assigned different events on
                    his program. One of the events I was assigned was the very first one on the
                    program, his arrival at Chequers. I think it was on a Sunday, so Harold Wilson
                    was at the Prime Minister's country place at Chequers. Ambassador Bruce went to
                    the airport along with Foreign Minister Stewart to meet the President and bring
                    him to Chequers. The Prime Minister and I were at the front door, waiting for
                    the President. Henry Kissinger was with him, and Ronald Nessen, and the White
                    House doctor; all the rest of the President's party went straight into town to
                    the hotel to get themselves established. We had our discussions out there, which
                    was very pleasant, a nice supper and everything. Before the President left, he
                    and Wilson went into a room for a private conversation, and Kissinger and Nessen
                    and the Ambassador and I were parked in an anteroom someplace. The journey into
                    town, of course, was all arranged; so and so was riding in this car and that car
                    and so on, a whole caravan of cars. The Ambassador was supposed to ride into
                    town with the President. Instead, when Nixon emerged, he piled into the
                    limousine and Kissinger and Nessen piled in with him. The Ambassador was left
                    standing on the doorstep, along with Wilson and myself. Of course, I had an
                    Embassy car and driver who had brought me out to the place, so I gave the
                    Ambassador a ride back into town.</p>
                <p>Nixon had other appointments at the hotel. They took one whole floor of the
                    Claridge Hotel, a block from Grosvenor Square. We brought in the head of the
                    Conservative Party, Ted Heath at the time, and the head of the Liberal Party,
                    Jeremy Thorpe, for private conversations with the President in his hotel. A
                    White House photographer would take pictures of them when they arrived, shaking
                    hands with the President, sitting down to begin their conversation. When it came
                    Thorpe's turn, the White House photographer was missing, and Thorpe was very
                    keen to have his picture taken with the President. While he was chatting with
                    Nixon, I went dashing around the hotel looking for the photographer. Never did
                    locate him. Thorpe's time with the President was up, and he had to leave because
                    the next appointment was following on. He was very upset that he had been denied
                    an opportunity for a photo with the President. Later that day when I reported
                    this to Ron Spiers, who was Political Counselor, he said he'd take care of it.
                    He got one of the White House staffers to agree to have Nixon sign a photo for
                    Thorpe. It arrived a couple of weeks later, and I took it over to the House of
                    Commons. I walked into Thorpe's office, and there on the wall was a photo
                    apparently of him with the President in the room at the Claridge Hotel,
                    identical to photos I had seen of the President with other people. He confessed
                    that he had borrowed a photo from someone else who had had an appointment and
                    had a picture of himself superimposed on it so it looked as though he had had a
                    photo with the President! Which he should have had. Shows the ego of a
                    politician who wants to be photographed with the President, and how a personally
                    autographed photo with “To my dear friend Jeremy Thorpe” written on it was a
                    poor second to what he had managed to fake for himself.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>It was during that assignment, too, that the Labor Party was tossed out of
                    office, in the elections of '70 or '71, and the Conservatives came in. Ted Heath
                    was now Prime Minister. Secretary of State Rogers came to London to attend an
                    annual conference of the American Bar Association. While he was there, he wanted
                    to have a talk with the Prime Minister. It was a weekend, so Heath was at
                    Chequers. Since I had become “Chequers attach�" in the Embassy, I took Secretary
                    Rogers out there on a Sunday afternoon to meet with Ted Heath and the Foreign
                    Secretary, Alex Douglas Home. Because it was a weekend, an informal occasion and
                    everything, I took my own camera along. I took snapshots of Heath and Douglas
                    Home greeting Secretary Rogers. Heath and Rogers went inside to have a private
                    chat, while Douglas Home and a couple of people from the Foreign Office and I
                    sat out in the garden, because it was a lovely summer afternoon. I took some
                    more pictures of Douglas Home and others out there. Pretty soon, one of the
                    staff came out of the house and said the Prime Minister wanted me to come in and
                    take some photos of him with Rogers since there was no British official
                    photographer present. I went in and took pictures of Heath and Rogers together,
                    finished up the roll of film. Next day I took it to be developed; went back to
                    pick up the prints a couple of days later, and there was nothing. Something had
                    gone wrong with the camera. There was not one useable picture. Nothing. For days
                    after that I kept waiting for the telephone to ring, somebody from Number 10,
                    saying that the Prime Minister would like to have copies of those photos. But
                    they never did call, so the incident just passed off. I had no souvenirs to show
                    for it and was not subject to the embarrassment of being asked for photos that I
                    couldn't produce. I promptly got rid of that camera and bought a much simpler
                    one.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>In senior officer Personnel, in '75-'77, I mentioned before the frustration I
                    felt trying to get anything done or any feeling of satisfaction as compared to
                    my previous assignment in the old-fashioned Personnel Operations Division. The
                    introduction of the so-called Open Assignments System in 1975 was supposed to be
                    accompanied by a re-establishment of PER's central authority. PER was supposed
                    to have the final say again, except that Ambassadors and Assistant Secretaries
                    could veto assignments of their immediate deputies and their personal
                    secretaries. In practice, they were given their choice for those positions.
                    Other senior officers were supposed to be chosen by the office of Personnel in
                    consultation with the Bureau concerned. In other words, section chiefs in
                    embassies we could assign without the ambassador's concurrence and office
                    directors or assistant directors in bureaus without the concurrence of the
                    bureau. After due consultation, of course. In fact, as far as the bureaus were
                    concerned, it did not work that way. Any time we tried to assign a senior
                    officer to a bureau that the bureau had not suggested itself, the assistant
                    secretary would run to the Director General, and we would have to undo the
                    assignment and put in whoever the bureau wanted. It worked better overseas, in
                    that we could assign principal officers at constituent posts and section chiefs
                    in embassies without running into much trouble. As a result, the three of us who
                    manned the senior assignment branch at the time were personally affected. Bob
                    Houghton had mostly Middle East background and was assigned to Istanbul as
                    principal officer. Frank Starrs had served in Spain, spoke Spanish, and was
                    assigned to Mexico City as Political Counselor. The job that I coveted, since I
                    was completing only two years in Washington and expected to stay longer, was the
                    Director of the Office of Central European Affairs—Germany, Austria,
                    Switzerland. But the European Bureau wanted Bill Woessner, who was then
                    political counselor in London. Woessner had succeeded me in London in '72 as the
                    officer covering the British Labor Party and had moved up in '76 to be Political
                    Counselor. The bureau brought him back to be the Director of Central Europe. I
                    declined Carl Ackerman's offer to stay on and run the senior assignments office.
                    On the pattern of these other assignments, Ackerman told me one day he had
                    consulted with the European Bureau and it was okay with them that I go back to
                    London as Political Counselor. That's how that transpired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '77 to '78.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>SULSER: There were two things we did in that senior assignments office that I
                    didn't mention. After Carter became President, he set up an ambassadorial
                    screening panel chaired by Warren Christopher, who was then the Deputy
                    Secretary. This panel, which included non-governmental people as well, was
                    supposed to assure that the best qualified candidates were chosen for
                    ambassadorial posts. Our office acted as secretariat for this screening
                    committee in that we wrote up the resumes of the candidates. At the beginning we
                    were invited to suggest people we thought should be serious candidates for
                    ambassadorships, but Houghton and Starrs and I soon found that that didn't cut
                    much ice. The names we suggested never seemed to make it onto the lists of
                    people we were told to prepare resumes on. The panel met more or less weekly, so
                    each week we would get a list of names we were supposed to write up for various,
                    specific ambassadorial vacancies. We were to emphasize their abilities,
                    experience, management, creative skills, policy innovativeness and all that kind
                    of thing, and to make each one appear to be the obvious, ideal candidate for
                    post x, whatever might be on the agenda for that week. There were a number of
                    people who were obviously favorites of higher ups in the Department, Carol Laise
                    or assistant secretaries around the place, who appeared and reappeared on these
                    lists all the time. If they would fail to be selected for post x, they would
                    appear next week on the list of candidates for post y. We had to rewrite the
                    resume to make them sound like the absolutely right choice for post y or post w
                    or post z, and so on.</p>
                <p>The other regular piece of work we had to do was to prepare a written report
                    monthly, to Carol Laise, on women officers who had been assigned during the
                    month to what were called “key” positions. Those were identified as DCMships,
                    deputy assistant secretaryships, principal officerships, office directorships.
                    She was keen to make sure that women were given opportunities. This was apart
                    from the Open Assignment System. It didn't matter whether these women had asked
                    for these jobs on their bid lists or not, or even whether they were completing
                    their current assignment</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>When I was due to leave Frankfurt in the summer of '75, the political counselor
                    in Bonn was transferred to a DCMship in Austria or Hungary, and Ambassador
                    Hillenbrand asked the Department to transfer me to Bonn as his political
                    counselor. But the Department came back and said I had been at that stage over
                    three and a half years in Germany, four years without home leave and that to
                    remain another assignment in Germany would be contrary to Personnel policies.
                    Besides, we had just withdrawn from Vietnam and they had several senior
                    German-speaking officers who had served in Vietnam or on the Vietnam Task Force
                    in Washington who needed assignment, and one of those (Dick Smyser) was being
                    assigned as political counselor. Hillenbrand went back and said, “Okay, then
                    extend Sulser for a year, move him up to be Principal Officer in Frankfurt,”
                    because Bob Harlan, the Principal Officer, was transferred that summer too. The
                    Department came back with the same reasoning, and in fact Wolf Lehmann, who had
                    been the last DCM in Saigon, was transferred to Frankfurt as the Principal
                    Officer. So two jobs I could have moved up to, aspired to as a new 01, were
                    taken by officers who became available because of our withdrawal from Vietnam. I
                    declined the Inspection Corps and wound up in Personnel, when Bob Houghton
                    called and asked me to work with him in Senior Assignments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then we move to London. Who was ambassador when you
                        moved to London in '77?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Kingman Brewster.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background and how did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: He had been the head of Yale University, president, I guess he was
                    called. By coincidence his resume for the Court of St. James was one of those I
                    had written up for the Ambassadorial Selection Panel. Of course, I did my best
                    to make him sound like the absolute ideal candidate for ambassador to Great
                    Britain. I'm absolutely sure my resume had nothing to do with his selection. The
                    key factor was that he had been a roommate, in college or in law school, of
                    Cyrus Vance, who was then the Secretary of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Brewster was selected as Ambassador and came in to see Bob Houghton and me about
                    the candidates for his DCMship, the minister, in London. We had prepared a good
                    list of candidates, some of whom we had chosen, some of whom had been proposed
                    by the European Bureau. He had talked to Art Hartman, the Assistant Secretary
                    for Europe, who had supported the candidacy of Ed Streator, who was then the DCM
                    at our Mission to NATO, in Brussels. Because of the European Bureau's
                    recommendation, Streator was on our list of candidates too. We spent an hour or
                    so with Brewster in Bob Houghton's office going through the files of all of
                    these candidates. To no one's surprise, he chose the one that Art Hartman had
                    recommended to him, Ed Streator. As Brewster was leaving our office he said, “I
                    understand I'll be needing a new Political Counselor as well because the fellow
                    there is coming back to the Department.” I said, “Yes, Mr. Ambassador, we'll
                    take care of that in consultation with the European Bureau.” In the end I got
                    assigned to the job myself, and that proved to be the biggest disaster of my
                    Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>It got off to a very bad start. Brewster arrived in London a couple of months
                    before I did, and Streator arrived a couple of weeks before I did. One of my
                    first days there, Streator met with me and the head of the Economic Section. He
                    said that when he was DCM in the U.S. Mission to NATO, nothing went out of that
                    Mission without him personally approving it. He realized that in London the
                    reporting volume was too extensive to require anything like that, but he wanted
                    to know what was in preparation. If there was a report being planned that he was
                    interested in, then he would get involved. He intended to meet with me and the
                    head of the Economic Section every day for us to tell him what our staffs were
                    planning to report about, what approach we were taking, sources, why we were
                    doing this, how we were planning to handle it, etc. Every day we'd meet with him
                    and report what our staffs were planning. He would occasionally suggest a
                    subject he thought worthwhile. Only very rarely would he ask to see something in
                    draft. More often he would ask to see it in final before it went out. At the end
                    of this first conversation he looked at the Economic Counselor and me and said,
                    “If you don't like doing things this way, Ambassador Brewster will use his
                    personal connection with Secretary Vance to get you transferred.” Just like
                    that. Neither the Economic Counselor nor I had expressed any objections or
                    reservations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's standard operating procedure to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>SULSER: Not unusual, I guess. Certainly nothing like that happened with Jimmy
                    Riddleberger in Vienna. He was not concerned on a daily basis with reporting,
                    nor his DCMs either. But, okay. Before we even had a chance to express our views
                    on it, he threatens us with transfer if we didn't like doing things that way.
                    Also, at Streator's suggestion, the Ambassador met with what you might call the
                    Country Team on a daily basis. Streator said that he had suggested to the
                    Ambassador that since he was new to this business, to begin with at least,
                    instead of having weekly staff meetings he might like to meet every day and have
                    a closer idea of what was going on in the Embassy. So every morning at 9:00 this
                    small group of 10 or 12 people would meet with the Ambassador. We'd go around
                    the table and report what was going on, what we were planning to do for the day,
                    what our staffing situation was, things like that, whatever we wanted to
                    mention. At the end of that meeting the Economic Counselor and I would adjourn
                    to Streator's office and we'd have our session on reporting subjects. These
                    daily meetings with the Ambassador went on every day the year I was there. He
                    never did get to the point when he might go back to the usual practice of weekly
                    staff meetings. The number of people participating in these daily meetings grew.
                    Pretty soon we were 15 or 20 people meeting every morning, including members of
                    the Economic, Political and USIS sections, rather than just the section
                    chiefs.</p>
                <p>The first time the Ambassador asked to see me, not long after I got there, he
                    called me to his office. He was there with Will Ito, his junior staff aide, a
                    first-tour Foreign Service officer who had been in the Political Section for a
                    while, and was now working out of the Ambassador's office. The Ambassador wanted
                    to know what my plans were for realigning the reporting responsibilities in the
                    Political Section to benefit what he called “some real hot shots.” He mentioned
                    Bob Blackwill, who was dealing with Western European affairs, and Jack Binns,
                    who was in my old job, covering the Labor Party, and Ray Seitz, who was covering
                    Africa and the Conservative Party. The Ambassador wanted to have their workloads
                    lightened so they could concentrate more on these particular subjects, which he
                    thought to be of key importance. I told him I had several ideas for
                    accomplishing that, but Seitz and Blackwill were both in the U.S. on home leave
                    and Binns was on extended local leave. I hadn't even met them yet. It amounted
                    to an instruction to let these favored three do only what they wanted, and the
                    other six political officers should take up the slack. I responded to the
                    Ambassador that I wanted to talk with these members of my staff personally about
                    my ideas before I made any decisions. That was all there was to that “private”
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>These daily meetings with the Ambassador were very strange, in that in my
                    recollection he never once responded to anything that was said by any of the
                    people around the table. He would occasionally ask a question, but he would
                    never indicate whether he agreed with what was being said or planned, or
                    disagreed, or whether he had some idea about how whatever subject was under
                    discussion should be approached or handled. Never any kind of a response that
                    indicated how he felt or what his desires were on any of the things that were
                    discussed there. As far as I was concerned, there was a complete lack of
                    communication, any kind of guidance or real dialogue at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Having served in London twice before I knew a lot of people in the Labor and
                    Liberal Party in the British government who were then in higher positions than
                    when I had first known them. The Ambassador being new to this business and
                    Streator being new to Britain, I was concerned that I should not try to appear
                    as the know-it-all and say I, I, I all the time, that I knew this guy and that
                    guy and therefore should be kingpin. I tried to play a low-key role, concern
                    myself with what the Political Section was doing and help them with their
                    reporting, get stuff out on time. At one of the very first conversations with
                    Streator, he said he hoped I didn't mind that he and the Ambassador liked to
                    deal directly with members of my staff. Although Woessner had warned me,
                    stupidly, I didn't object. I figured, it's their Embassy, these people are on
                    their staff, if they want to deal directly with people that are handling
                    subjects of interest to them, I certainly couldn't stop them. I suppose in
                    hindsight what I should have done was tell the members of my staff that if they
                    saw the Ambassador or Streator they should tell me about it. I didn't do that
                    either. Luke Kinsolving, who covered the Middle East, was the only one who ever
                    made a point after being asked up to the front office of coming in and telling
                    me what had transpired. Blackwill and Binns and Seitz never did. These four were
                    up and down the hallway to Streator's or the Ambassador's office quite
                    regularly. My door was usually open, and I saw them parading up and down there a
                    lot.</p>
                <p>A couple of times early on Streator, in making his calls on ministers and junior
                    ministers in the government, had asked me to go along with him. On the way I
                    would tell him what I knew about these people, their background, their interests
                    and so on, without saying I've known this guy for years and he's a friend of
                    mine, or anything like that. We'd arrive at the office, be ushered in and I'd be
                    greeted very warmly on a first-name basis which kind of embarrassed me. I don't
                    know how Streator felt about it, but after that happened a couple of times he
                    stopped asking me to go with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>So it was not a very harmonious situation. My first assignment in London, in the
                    visa section, I had thought, gee, if I were in the Political Section I'd have
                    some idea of what was going on in this huge Embassy. Then the next time I was in
                    the Political Section, and I thought, Boy, to be head of the Political Section
                    I'd finally know what was going on at the top levels of this place. The third
                    time I was head of the Political Section, and despite these daily meetings with
                    the Ambassador and the DCM I still didn't feel I was in any way privy to their
                    concerns or their political activities. EXDIS and NODIS telegrams that came in
                    were not shared with me; they went into the front office and I was never invited
                    to see them regularly. Almost every day, Streator would call me several times on
                    the telephone and ask if I had seen such-and-such telegram from the Department.
                    Once in a while that would be an EXDIS telegram, usually it was not. Whenever he
                    would call I would say, “Yes, I have seen it and this is what we're doing about
                    it.” Which was always his second question. On those rare occasions when it was
                    an EXDIS telegram I'd say, “No, I haven't seen that.” He'd say, “Oh, you don't
                    see EXDIS telegrams?” and I'd say, “No, not unless you show them to me.” Then
                    he'd have me come down and I'd see that particular telegram and tell him what I
                    proposed to do about it, if it involved Political Section activity or response,
                    which it often did. On my last day there, after a year, he called as usual
                    several times. On the last call he said, “I've been calling you about these
                    telegrams for a year, and you have always seen it, and you've always made
                    arrangements to deal with it. I don't know why I keep calling you.” Of course, I
                    wondered too. He's that kind of a very close manager. He needs to feel that
                    there is nothing happening that he is not involved in, that is not under his
                    control. Since then I've talked to people who have worked with him at NATO and
                    other places and this apparently has been SOP throughout his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for his relationship with Brewster? I
                        mean, was Brewster pushing something, or was he sort of absorbing, with all
                        this. In the first place these staff meetings sound like a tremendous use of
                        important time for the Embassy, to have staff meetings to inform the
                        Ambassador. It's all very nice, but at the same time these are all working
                        people. It's a lot of resource time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Some of my colleagues, other section leaders, used to complain about
                    having to go down there every day and spend a half-hour to 45 minutes, getting
                    nothing for it, no response or guidance, or being reined in on anything either,
                    which you'd have to expect sometimes too. That it was a waste of time they would
                    rather be spending doing something else. Other than invoking the Ambassador's
                    name to get us transferred if we didn't like the way he did business, I really
                    couldn't tell what their relationship was. I had no reason to believe it was
                    difficult in any way, or that it was really the Ambassador who was pushing any
                    of this stuff.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>It might have been Streator's idea, but the Ambassador seemed to be behind the
                    plan to convene meetings of selected U.S. ambassadors in Western Europe
                    quarterly to talk about regional things, keep in touch with each other on common
                    problems, such as European integration, NATO, and things like that. This was
                    Blackwill's area, at least as far as political-military things were concerned,
                    and he acted as the executive secretary, if you will, of these meetings. The
                    first one was held at Brewster's invitation in London, and the others were held
                    in other places. They didn't include all U.S. ambassadors in Western Europe by
                    any means, just what they considered the principal ones, France, Germany, Italy,
                    NATO. Not long after this started, probably after the first meeting, I was
                    informed that Blackwill was being detached from the Political Section and
                    henceforth would get instructions from the DCM and Ambassador. About nine months
                    after I got there, Blackwill was transferred to Tel Aviv as political counselor,
                    and Streator asked me to write his Efficiency Report, even though Blackwill had
                    worked theoretically as a member of my staff only the first three months I was
                    there, and had been six months up in the front office. I wrote a good Efficiency
                    Report and Streator put the reviewing officer statement on it.</p>
                <p>Once, during these daily meetings with the Ambassador, the Ambassador noted that
                    President Carter was not getting very good press in Britain, and did anyone have
                    any ideas what we might do to improve this. I said I knew that the Guardian, the
                    major national newspaper of an independent political sort (now—in 1994—The
                    Independent), had off-the-record editorial staff background meetings for invited
                    people. If the Ambassador was interested in doing that, the editor of the
                    editorial page was an old friend and I could arrange for him to be invited to
                    meet with the editorial staff of the Guardian to explain and defend Carter's
                    policies. As usual, there was no reaction to this suggestion. I never heard any
                    more about it until about a month later I got a telephone call from my friend at
                    the Guardian asking if I could have lunch with him the next day. He told me then
                    that the Ambassador had been in the day before for such a session. Apparently,
                    the Ambassador had decided that this was something that might be worth doing,
                    but instead of asking me, who had made the suggestion, to set this up, he asked
                    the Press Attach� to arrange it. The reason my friend, who chaired these
                    meetings, wanted to see me afterward was to ask me about the Ambassador, because
                    he said of the scores of such meetings they had had with various ambassadors,
                    government officials, business leaders, etc., this was the least informative,
                    most unresponsive such meeting he had ever participated in. He said he had
                    gotten up and walked out during the meeting while the Ambassador was speaking
                    because he didn't have anything to say. I was in the very uncomfortable position
                    of being asked what I thought about this. What could I say to an old friend? I
                    did not want to be in the position of criticizing my Ambassador, but based on my
                    own observations of him in these daily staff meetings I was not totally
                    surprised. I just tried not to respond, not to join in the criticism.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>During both of my London political tours, I gave talks on U.S. foreign policy at
                    the senior British military colleges, and I usually handled briefings for
                    visiting American groups, World Affairs Councils, university groups, whatever,
                    about U.S.-U.K. relations. On two occasions during the time I was there with
                    Brewster, people from these groups came up to me afterwards and introduced
                    themselves as trustees of Yale University and asked me what I thought about my
                    Ambassador. I tried to say nothing critical whatsoever about him, but they would
                    proceed to tell me how glad they were to get rid of him, that he had been a
                    detriment as head of Yale, I suppose because of his sympathy with the sit-ins
                    and whatnot during the Vietnam War. These trustees claimed that during his time
                    as president of Yale their fund-raising had suffered badly because a lot of the
                    alumni of Yale who normally could be counted on to contribute substantially to
                    endowment funds were so critical of him. These occasions in which people were
                    putting me on the spot were very difficult.</p>
                <p>By the time these incidents occurred, I was already a short-timer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can understand your unhappiness, but what happened? Why
                        did you leave within such a short time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: About three or four months after I got there I was attending a
                    Conservative Party conference with Ray Seitz. About the second day, he wasn't
                    there anymore. I began to worry that something had happened to him. I telephoned
                    the Embassy and learned that he had been called back to London because the
                    Assistant Secretary for Africa was in town and they wanted Ray to look after
                    him. Neither he nor anybody else in the Embassy had bothered to tell me that he
                    was being called back and that I was up there for the rest of the conference on
                    my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like...I don't know. Discipline just wasn't
                        there. Or normal courtesy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SULSER: There was no problem in covering the rest of the conference and doing up
                    the report afterward and everything. The reason the Assistant Secretary for
                    Africa was there was to meet with the British regarding plans for the
                    independence of Rhodesia, to become Zimbabwe. Dick Moose was the Assistant
                    Secretary and he was meeting with David Owen, who was the Foreign Secretary.
                    After I got back from the Conservative Party conference and could follow these
                    discussions that were going on, I was having lunch one day with Tom McNally, who
                    was another old friend. He had been one of the junior staffers in the
                    international section at Labor Party headquarters during my previous assignment
                    and then moved up to be the International Secretary. When Callaghan became
                    Foreign Secretary, McNally became his political adviser, and now when I was
                    there as Political Counselor, Callaghan was the Prime Minister and McNally was
                    his political adviser at No. 10 Downing Street. I was having lunch with him one
                    day and he asked me how I thought these talks about Rhodesia were going. I told
                    him, “Well, they seem to be going alright, but there is one little point on
                    which Moose is unhappy, thinks that Owen is doing the wrong thing, so he has
                    sent a telegram back to Washington suggesting that Secretary Vance call Owen and
                    reinforce the U.S. view on this particular point.” As I learned later, when
                    McNally went back to No. 10 after this luncheon, he ran into David Owen on
                    Downing Street, between No. 10 and the Foreign Office, and said, “Oh, David,
                    you're going to be getting a call from Cyrus Vance about these talks.” Owen,
                    apparently, went in and complained to Johnny Graham, who was Under Secretary for
                    African Affairs, one of Ray Seitz' regular contacts, that the Americans were
                    “going over his head to the Prime Minister.” He was annoyed about this, that the
                    U.S. had “gone over his head to the Prime Minister,” which I didn't see as
                    anything like that. I was having lunch with an old friend, who happened to be
                    the political adviser to the Prime Minister, who asked me a direct question on
                    how we thought the talks were going. I never have learned to lie, or at least
                    not very convincingly, when somebody asks me a question. So I answered his
                    question.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The next day, the Ambassador called me in for the second time since I had gotten
                    there and said he was afraid my usefulness at the Foreign Office had been lost
                    because the Foreign Secretary was mad at me. Johnny Graham had told Ray Seitz
                    about this and Seitz had told the Ambassador and the Ambassador called me in and
                    said he was afraid my usefulness with the Foreign Ministry was finished and he
                    was going to request my transfer. I said, “That's fine, Mr. Ambassador, I'm not
                    happy here anyhow, and I'm sorry but I'll be glad to get out of here.” I went
                    back to my office and called Carl Ackerman, who was still chief of Foreign
                    Service Assignments, and Bill Galloway, who was executive assistant to the Under
                    Secretary for Management, and told them that they would be getting a request
                    from the Ambassador for my transfer, and that this was fine with me. Of course,
                    they had not heard about it yet. In fact, it wasn't until more than two months
                    later, as I learned in due course, that the Ambassador had sent in his message
                    to the Director General asking not only that I be transferred, but also that the
                    number two in the political section, Jerry Friedman, be transferred. No
                    reference to any specific incident like this business over Rhodesia, but because
                    he wanted to move Binns and Seitz into those jobs. There were ten officers in
                    the political section then. Seitz was the most junior of them. He was an
                    old-style 04. Binns was the second most junior, a junior 03. Brewster wished
                    Binns to be the chief of the section and Seitz to be the deputy chief. I learned
                    later that the Department, after discussing it among the responsible people in
                    Washington, decided that there was no way they could prevent the Ambassador from
                    moving Binns and Seitz into these jobs on an acting basis. But since neither one
                    of them was a senior officer, they would on paper put Binns into the No. 2 job
                    and leave the No. 1 position, on paper, vacant for the duration of Binns'
                    assignment there. Which meant in effect that the political section would operate
                    one person short. They would have nine officers instead of ten. The Ambassador
                    agreed to this. I learned from friends in Washington that he had asked for
                    Friedman's transfer as well as my own, so he could give a career opportunity to
                    these relatively junior officers. It was several weeks after that that Friedman
                    finally told me he was being transferred. No one in London had told me. Friedman
                    told me when he was called in to be told they were going to request his
                    transfer, Streator had done this and had instructed him not to say anything to
                    me about it. But he reached the point when he just couldn't stomach going to
                    these daily meetings any more, and he wanted me to know why he would refuse to
                    go to them, because they were kicking him out. I told him I sympathized with
                    him, I could understand why he did not want to continue to go to those meetings,
                    but I thought he ought to know that I was also leaving—which he had not known up
                    to that point. They had not told him I was being transferred; they had not told
                    me he was being transferred and had told him not to tell me. I continued to go
                    to those meetings until my assignment to Rotterdam came through.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The day I got my orders I went on annual leave and had no intention of going into
                    the Embassy any more. Let Binns and Seitz have those jobs. Friedman did the same
                    thing. His DCMship in Abidjan came through about the same time my transfer to
                    Rotterdam did, and we both went on leave and vacated our offices. Inspectors
                    arrived at that point, for which Friedman and I had helped prepare the required
                    documents, and the head of the inspection team called me at home one day to ask
                    me to come in the office. He had formed his own impressions, had heard a lot of
                    things from different people about how the post was managed, and wanted to ask
                    me some questions about it. I still tried to be as objective as I could. Leave
                    out the personal stuff to the greatest extent I could in responding to his
                    questions. More than four months later, when I was in Washington for
                    consultations after I had been in Rotterdam for three months, I was allowed to
                    see the inspection report and found that the inspector had chastised the
                    management of the post, criticized the Ambassador for playing no role and for
                    allowing Streator to run the place with a heavy hand. The Deputy Inspector
                    General, an old London colleague from my second time there, told me that
                    Brewster had hit the roof over the inspection report and had tried to get it
                    suppressed. I was interested to note that Terry Arnold, the fellow who had
                    headed the inspection team, got a principal officership for his final
                    assignment, as well, whereas a lot of the senior officers running inspection
                    teams got ambassadorships. So I guess Brewster still had some clout around
                    there, with an old roommate of his as Secretary of State. It was a very unhappy
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To finish up here...Ray Seitz became the only Foreign
                        Service officer ever to become ambassador to Great Britain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I recognized he was an exceptional officer. Before I left London I
                    successfully recommended him for the Director General's reporting award and
                    obtained his promotion to 03 ahead of his class by stating in his efficiency
                    report that of the ten officers in the section, he was the only one I could see
                    as ambassador at his next post, having in mind a small embassy in Africa. When
                    the award and early promotion came through, he acknowledged his debt on both
                    counts in a letter to me in Rotterdam. A year later, he went back to Washington
                    as a Deputy Assistant Secretary in Public Affairs and became Executive Secretary
                    of the Department before returning to London as DCM. Then he was appointed
                    Assistant Secretary for Europe and then back to London as Ambassador. When I
                    wrote to congratulate him on being the new Ambassador to the Court of St. James
                    and the first career officer to hold that position, I told him that he now
                    joined me as the only Foreign Service officer to serve three times in London,
                    which I believe is correct. I suppose he is now out of there; I think Admiral
                    Crowe is there now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I think he's out. What about Ed Streator?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SULSER: Streator stayed on a long time. The rest of Brewster's time and through
                    the next two if not three Ambassadors he remained the DCM, then he was to get an
                    ambassadorship in Africa but failed the physical. He had had a heart attack
                    before he came to London as DCM. He had heart surgery, as I understand it, and
                    then went to Paris as head of our mission to OECD and then retired. He took a
                    job as Executive Secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce in London, where
                    he was the last time I heard anything about him.</p>
                <p>After I had been in Rotterdam for a time, my friend on the Guardian sent me a
                    clipping from the New York Times, an article by R.W. “Johnny” Apple, who was
                    then the London bureau chief, later the Washington bureau chief. It was an
                    article about Brewster called “The Silent Ambassador,” saying that of all the
                    recent ambassadors to London, Brewster seemed to be the quietest in terms of his
                    involvement, almost nonexistent in terms of impact.</p>
                <p>Shortly before I left London, Richard Perle, who was well known as the political
                    military adviser to Senator “Scoop” Jackson, came to London on a CODEL visit,
                    and we organized a luncheon for him in the Ambassador's private dining room with
                    McNally and a couple of other influential young Brits. During the course of the
                    conversation McNally said this might be his last chance to see Binns, whom he
                    knew must be leaving pretty soon. Binns, visibly embarrassed, said no, his
                    assignment had been extended. I made sure I saw McNally out and I told him, “You
                    touched on an embarrassing point because Binns is not leaving, I'm leaving.
                    Binns is taking my job.” McNally was very upset and said, “Why are they doing
                    this? There couldn't possibly be any better Political Counselor from our
                    standpoint than you,” and that sort of thing. (Bill Woessner had told me that
                    when McNally learned at Woessner's farewell party that I would be replacing him,
                    McNally responded very warmly and told the Ambassador they couldn't possibly
                    have a better person for the job than me.)</p>
                <p>I told him it went back to the luncheon I'd had with him about Zimbabwe, and that
                    I gathered he had run into David Owen and mentioned our unhappiness with one
                    particular issue and that Owen had been upset that we had “gone over his head,”
                    as he put it, and had passed it on to Johnny Graham, who passed it on to Ray
                    Seitz, who told the Ambassador. As a result he was booting me out of there.
                    McNally got very upset and said, “They can't do that! I will see that the
                    Ambassador never gets to see the Prime Minister again; I can prevent that, I can
                    see that he is never in No. 10 again,” and so on. I said, “Please, don't do
                    anything like that. U.S.-U.K. relations are a hell of a lot more important than
                    the career of Jack Sulser. Please don't do anything like that. In fact, I am
                    glad to be leaving here. I'm not enjoying working with these guys. I am out of
                    here!”</p>
                <p>This has been kind of a confessional for me. I am putting on this tape things I
                    have never said to anybody in the 16 or 17 years since this happened.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well obviously, I think it's very important to understand
                        some of the things that go on. This is both organizational, how things are
                        done. I knew very little about Brewster except that he had the reputation at
                        Yale of turning the asylum over to the lunatics. Yale had a very bad
                        reputation during the Vietnam War of not being sound, in other words, there
                        was a great student rebellion and all of that but most other universities
                        and colleges seemed to weather this fairly well by allowing people to say
                        their piece, but Yale seemed to have gone completely overboard. And Brewster
                        seemed to have gone for student popularity as opposed to what I would call
                        “soundness,” saying that everybody has the right to talk, even free speech
                        was curtailed at Yale, from what I understand. I'm only speaking
                        hearsay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: That was more or less what these two members of the board of trustees
                    said, whom I met very casually; they had no hesitation about giving me their
                    view and how they hoped that with him gone their fund-raising would improve
                    again. But I never had an argument with him. The closest I ever came to having
                    an argument with Streator was shortly after I arrived and had just come out of
                    Personnel management in Washington. There was an officer assigned to the
                    Political Section out of the Department. Streator wanted me to use what he
                    presumed were my connections in PER to get the assignment canceled, and instead
                    to get so-and-so, who was a friend of Streator's. Having just come from PER,
                    where I fought endless and largely losing battles to keep people from operating
                    that way, I refused to do this. I think he may have tried on his own, but it
                    didn't work and I didn't help him. Otherwise, on the face of things, our
                    relations were always okay, and I went through these daily meetings with him and
                    the Ambassador for more than six months after I had one foot out the door. I
                    kept up appearances. Some of the things I said today I never even told my wife,
                    and here I am putting them on tape.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning now to Rotterdam. You served in Rotterdam from '78
                        to '82. What was the situation? The Vietnam War was all over, which had been
                        a major irritant with the Dutch. What was the situation for American-Dutch
                        relations during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: They were fine. This was not only a great relief after my year in London,
                    but I had the almost 100% sheer pleasure that goes with a post of your own.
                    There are always things that cause some groups of people, at least, to protest.
                    At that time it was El Salvador. We had a few demonstrations, people climbing up
                    on the roof of the Consulate and hanging banners over the side about various
                    things they objected to. Somebody in some country was killing somebody on our
                    behalf and, they thought, at our direction, that kind of business. Occasional
                    parades, we had the Tehran hostage business while I was there, plus there were
                    Iranian student groups in Holland that Dutch intelligence forces thought were
                    occasionally interested in doing something about me or the Consulate. So from
                    time to time I had some police protection there.</p>

                <p>Rotterdam was nice and quiet. Rotterdam really is an exceptional town. I was so
                    pleased these past two days watching the Davis Cup match out of Rotterdam,
                    because they showed many scenes of the place. It was a thoroughly pleasant post
                    and unlike Amsterdam in almost every respect. It's just as Dutch, just as
                    international, but is much more sober, a real business-oriented town. It's the
                    largest port in the world, by far, much larger than Kobe-Osaka, which is second,
                    and many times larger than New York, Hamburg, Marseille, San Francisco, all very
                    small compared to Rotterdam. It's a post-oriented city. Although it's only 20
                    minutes or so by car from The Hague, it is very different from The Hague. It's
                    enough of a distance from the Embassy so that I really was very much on my own
                    there. I went to weekly staff meetings at the Embassy, and the Ambassador and
                    DCMs were always very cordial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: The Ambassador during most of my time there was Geri Joseph, a woman from
                    Minneapolis, former newspaper columnist, former co-chairman of the National
                    Democratic Committee, friend of Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale. A very, very
                    pleasant and capable woman. And Tom Dunnigan was DCM, whom I had known in my
                    first London days—my wife was his secretary, as a matter of fact—so he was my
                    wife's boss at the beginning of our Foreign Service and he was my boss at the
                    end of my Foreign Service. Then with the change of administration Bill Dyess
                    became Ambassador, but that was only about the last year I was there, so there
                    was less connection. We had had a Consulate in Rotterdam for nearly 200 years.
                    In fact, we celebrated the 200th year of Netherlands-U.S. diplomatic relations
                    during my last year in Rotterdam. The longest period of uninterrupted relations
                    the United States has had with any country in the world. There were year-long
                    festivities which were very pleasant to participate in. One of the events was a
                    yacht race from Rotterdam to New York, done in two phases, the larger ones that
                    could go straight across and the smaller ones that needed to stop at the Azores.
                    They had two different starting dates. One of my good contacts, who was head of
                    one of the three elements of the Christian Democratic Party in Holland, also was
                    the CEO of a large insurance company that sponsored one of the yachts in the
                    direct race to New York. I had never had anything to do with yachting before but
                    learned that, when you sponsor a yacht in a race such as this, the sponsor has
                    the right to re-name the yacht for the period of the race, which he did. He put
                    it in the name of his insurance company, Stad Rotterdam, which means City of
                    Rotterdam. He invited me to do the christening of this “new” yacht. Ambassador
                    Joseph was invited to christen one of the competitors. The yacht I christened
                    won the race, which was a special pleasure. One of the local companies, De
                    Kuyper distillery, sponsored a reception to start the race, hired a big cruise
                    ship, a river boat paddlewheel kind of thing with a couple of hundred guests to
                    go down the river from Rotterdam to the mouth and witness the official start of
                    the race. There was also a destroyer of the Royal Netherlands Navy. It was a
                    very gala affair, a lot of fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>The city government in Rotterdam was Labor Party; the Lord Mayor was one of the
                    vice-chairmen of the Labor Party who joined the Cabinet when the government was
                    reorganized, shortly after. I had very easy relations with City Hall and with
                    several Christian Democratic and FVP businessmen, lawyers in town. I was a
                    member of the Rotterdam Golf Club, which was good fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Dutch view the Germans at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I'm glad you mentioned that because I would have hated to record my
                    impressions of Holland without getting on to that subject. Rotterdam is the
                    largest port in the world because it is the major port for Germany, not because
                    of Holland. It's at the mouth of the Rhine, and most of the stuff that goes in
                    or comes out of Rotterdam is destined for or originates in Germany. The Dutch
                    are so sensitive to being second cousins to the Germans—the Dutch language is
                    really a dialect of German, although they would argue with me if they heard me
                    say that; it's very close to Plattdeutsch but is officially recognized as a
                    language. If you speak German you can be understood in Holland and you can learn
                    Dutch after learning a few words that are different in the two languages. But
                    the Dutch are so concerned about being overwhelmed by the Germans that some of
                    my Dutch friends, while they preferred German wine, would drink it only in the
                    privacy of their own homes. They didn't want to be seen drinking German wine in
                    restaurants or public places. Although Rotterdam really is at the mouth of the
                    Rhine, the Dutch call it the Maas because shortly after the river crosses the
                    border from Germany into Holland it's joined by two smaller rivers coming out of
                    Belgium, including the Meuse or Maas, and the Dutch choose to name the river
                    Maas from that point, although the Rhine is contributing three-quarters of the
                    water into this combined stream. One minor little tributary that empties into
                    the North Sea at Leyden, they call the Rhine. The chairman of the port promotion
                    council during the time I was in Rotterdam was a German citizen, head of a
                    German-owned shipping company there in town. But you never see in any public
                    references to him or the sort of official bio that's available from the port
                    promotion council that he is in fact a German citizen.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The German Consul General during my time was a very unusual person. He was
                    bilingual in Netherlands, which is not so unusual, but really was at home in the
                    language because he went to school in Holland. His parents were anti-Nazi and
                    didn't want him educated in schools in Germany during the Nazi times. When
                    Germany invaded Holland in 1940, most of the kids at the school, which was a
                    Friend's boarding school, were evacuated to England, but the headmaster of the
                    school told him, “Look, if you go to England, you're going to be an enemy alien
                    there and be treated as an enemy-alien. I think you'd better go back home to
                    Germany.” So he went back home and not long after was drafted into the German
                    Army. At some point during his military service, in a routine inspection I
                    think, anti-Nazi literature was found in his duffel bag and he was imprisoned by
                    the Nazis. You'd think with that kind of background he'd be welcome in Holland
                    as a representative of the new Germany, and feel comfortable there. But in fact
                    he told me he was very uncomfortable there, and his wife refused to live there.
                    She stayed in Germany because when she first came to Holland she felt she was
                    being treated badly by the Dutch.</p>
                <p>Our Dutch friends used to make jokes about the Germans all the time, and I
                    witnessed several very amusing incidents. We would have Dutch friends over or go
                    to Dutch friends' houses for a party and there were other Dutch friends there
                    who would arrive after we did, and delighted, so excited, to arrive at this
                    party because on the way they had been stopped by some German car full of
                    tourists to ask for direction. The Dutch would deliberately mislead them, give
                    them the wrong directions. A few minutes later they would arrive at the party
                    and be all excited because they had pulled a trick on these damn Germans. It's
                    unfortunate. I understand their feeling; it's sort of the way Canadians feel
                    about Americans, being overwhelmed by this much larger cousin next door who
                    speaks the same or similar language and threatens to take them over economically
                    or commercially. Unlike the Canadians, the Dutch did suffer a difficult
                    occupation for four years or more.</p>
                <p>Rotterdam has a special place in that context, because it was the only place that
                    offered any significant resistance to the German invasion in 1940. Then, as now,
                    the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps is headquartered in Rotterdam, and it had a
                    sufficiently deep channel so that Dutch warships can steam up into the center of
                    the city. When the Germans reached Rotterdam, there was a brigade of Dutch army,
                    the Dutch marines and one or two ships of the Dutch Navy that fought them off,
                    put up some real resistance, held up the German advance for several days. That
                    was when the Germans got annoyed, called up the Luftwaffe, and blew the place to
                    smithereens. The whole medieval city center was wiped out in one day of German
                    raids, and then the Dutch government surrendered, the Queen fled to England and
                    that was the end of it. So the Rotterdamers have something to be proud of in
                    that connection, but they have a very sensitive attitude toward the Germans that
                    I, living in Germany and Austria for 13 years and having been a POW, which is
                    nothing like the occupation the Dutch went through, never felt. But the Dutch
                    certainly did and I suspect still do.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned the differences between Rotterdam and
                        Amsterdam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Amsterdam gets all the tourists and all the congressional delegations. We
                    had, I think, two congressional delegations during my four years in Rotterdam,
                    both of them serious affairs. They were people coming to look at port facilities
                    because they were trying to develop ports in their constituencies in the United
                    States, to see how these things are done in Holland, some of the modern
                    equipment that's available, that handles ships of tremendous size and loads and
                    unloads them in a matter of hours, etc. We had one other more social CODEL, Tom
                    Railsback, from my home district, then the congressman from Illinois where I was
                    born and raised, came to Amsterdam. He and Henry Hyde, a friend of his, came
                    down to visit us in Rotterdam, which had not initially been on their itinerary,
                    because I knew him. They talked to our police chief about the drug scene.
                    Amsterdam has all the tourists and the CODELs and the trouble that goes with it,
                    such as lost passports, and the drug scene with American citizens in jail.
                    During my four years in Rotterdam we only had one American citizen in jail, and
                    that was somebody who had been arrested and tried and imprisoned in the
                    Amsterdam district but for some reason or other got transferred to a jail in our
                    district. One of our consular officers had to go from time to time to visit him
                    and see that he was being treated alright, allowed to communicate, bring him
                    reading material and such. That is not a problem in Holland; there is plenty of
                    English reading material, plenty of English programs on the television, because
                    it's not a large enough language area to justify dubbing, so you see the
                    American programs in the original language, unlike Germany where it is dubbed
                    into German.</p>
                <p>Amsterdam had repeated violent demonstrations with damage to the Consulate. We
                    never had any damage that amounted to anything. Once, somebody squirted some
                    stuff into the keyhole of our front door so that we had to get a locksmith to
                    open up the next morning; but otherwise no significant damage. In Amsterdam
                    every window in the Consulate was broken many times over...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what did you ascribe this? You must have sat down with
                        the consulate in Amsterdam to try and figure out why are people in Amsterdam
                        treated this way and in Rotterdam they're not. Because Amsterdam is renowned
                        within the Foreign Service. We nearly closed the place down one time just
                        because of violence.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, Amsterdam was closed for brief periods several times while I was in
                    Rotterdam in order to repair damage and get the place back into operation. One
                    time, Maury Bell, who was the Consul General there during this time, the damage
                    was so bad and he was so fed up with the repeated incidents that he said he was
                    not going to reopen the post until he had the kind of assurances from the local
                    government and the kind of police protection that he felt the place needed to
                    give it adequate security. Whenever Amsterdam would shut down, we'd have to pick
                    up the slack. Rotterdam did all the immigrant visas for the country anyhow, so
                    the consular work that was a problem was the non-immigrant visas, passports,
                    etc. In my four years in Rotterdam I don't know that we ever had a lost passport
                    case, whereas in Amsterdam they had some every day and every Monday morning
                    they'd arrive to open the post and find half a dozen people sitting on their
                    front doorstep. Americans who had lost their passport, been rolled or whatever
                    on the weekend who needed immediate attention. I think the difference is that
                    sort of drug and hippy atmosphere in Amsterdam. The red light district in
                    Amsterdam with the women sitting out in the glass show windows and whatnot. This
                    is a well-known feature of life there. I was surprised to find there is such a
                    district near the port for the sailors in Rotterdam too. But Rotterdam doesn't
                    attract the tourists, and the sailors, I guess, know how to deal with these
                    things without causing so much trouble. While Rotterdam is to some extent also a
                    drug transit place, it just did not have the kind of violence they did in
                    Amsterdam. They'd send their visa applicants and their passport applicants and
                    stuff down to us when they were closed. One time it went on for a couple of
                    months when we were the only consular post in the country. The Embassy in The
                    Hague has no consular section, and The Hague is in Rotterdam's consular
                    district.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far away is Rotterdam from Amsterdam by train?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Oh, by train, 45 minutes. Nothing is very far in Holland, particularly
                    between Amsterdam, The Hague, and Rotterdam. You get into some of the northeast
                    areas, Friesland and whatnot, it gets a little more isolated. But the major
                    cities are all very close to each other. You can get to The Hague in 15 or 20
                    minutes from Rotterdam, and a half hour from there to Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left Rotterdam in 1982, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, in 1982, after four years there. When I got there from London, my
                    predecessor, Joe Christiano, filled me in on efforts ever since the war to get a
                    building of our own for the consulate in Rotterdam. The prewar consulate had
                    been bombed out and ever since then we had been in rented quarters. One
                    principal officer after another, occasionally with an Ambassador's assistance,
                    tried to find some way to get a building of our own. During the years we had a
                    large AID program in Holland, some of the counterpart funds were used to acquire
                    a site from the city of Rotterdam right in the center of town, on one of the
                    main harbor inlets, on which the consulate was supposed to be built. But money
                    was never appropriated to build it. We had this prime piece of property at the
                    bottom of the main business street in Rotterdam, where it meets the river.
                    Christiano had worked out a scheme with a local builder to put up an apartment
                    house there. We would lease him the land at no cost, he would build the
                    apartment house, sell or rent the apartments, and give us the three lowest
                    floors to house the consulate. The U.S. would get a consulate to which it would
                    have title at no cost. Just for making the land available. The Department had
                    not yet approved this proposal, but Christiano said maybe I could get the
                    Department to approve it. I went to Rotterdam on direct transfer because the
                    deputy there was going on home leave the same time Christiano was being
                    transferred to Tokyo. Three months later, when the Deputy came back from home
                    leave, I got orders for consultation in Washington. While I was there, I managed
                    to get the Department to approve this scheme. Before anything could be done, the
                    housing market collapsed in Holland and the builder was no longer interested in
                    going ahead.</p>
                <p>During my last year there, through the contacts I had in City Hall, I learned
                    that the city was planning to build a maritime museum on the adjoining property.
                    I went to the official responsible and said, “I understand you're going to build
                    this museum next door, and you can have a much nicer building if you incorporate
                    our property as well and give us a corner of the thing.” He thought that was a
                    great idea, because he thought the city-owned space wouldn't be sufficient for
                    the kind of museum he contemplated. He got the architects to design a new museum
                    that would have a corner for us, had models built, and then discussed it with
                    his colleagues on the City Council. All this was at the time of El Salvador and
                    the violence in Amsterdam and peaceful demonstrations in Rotterdam, and his
                    colleagues on the City Council didn't think it would be a good idea under these
                    circumstances for the city to do such a public thing for the United States as to
                    give us a corner of a public building. But by that time he was so keen on having
                    our property for his museum he said if we can find a building somewhere else in
                    town that would meet your needs and buy it for you, would you give us that piece
                    of property. I said, in principle, sure, why not? The search began. The City had
                    real estate companies looking for office buildings that were for sale. Every
                    time they'd find one I'd get the DCM, the Admin. officer or whatever from The
                    Hague to come down and look at the property. “No, this wouldn't suit us; No,
                    that wouldn't suit us.” We were being very picky because the city really wanted
                    to have our property.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>Eventually they found a building that was large enough and in an accessible
                    location that would meet our needs. FBO sent somebody over from Washington, did
                    a survey of the thing. The city spent about a million dollars to acquire the
                    property for us. FBO and SY between them spent about another quarter of a
                    million adapting the property to our use. It wasn't quite ready for occupancy
                    when I left, unfortunately, so I didn't get to enjoy the benefit of my lobbying
                    with the city government to get this thing done. Don Junior, who was my
                    successor, came out of my old job in Senior Assignments, incidentally, got to
                    move into the building. About three years later the post was closed. My proudest
                    achievement in Rotterdam in the end came to naught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's move to your last assignment. This was in '82 and
                        you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: I had decided I would retire after Rotterdam. A few months before I left,
                    a big pay raise came through and it took me only a moment with paper and pencil
                    to figure how much good this would do to my annuity, to hang on another couple
                    of years—which was all I had. While I was in Rotterdam, the Senior Foreign
                    Service was established and I was moved into it at the Minister-Consular level,
                    but because of the years I had spent already in class 1, I had only four years.
                    The transition was done in 1980 and I had only til '84. I could serve only two
                    more years, but it made a big difference. But I had no assignment. I came back
                    on home leave, for the first time in my career as one of those over-complement
                    people I had tried to draw to the Department's attention when I was in Senior
                    Assignments. For the period of my home leave I was over complement, and then the
                    Senior Assignments people asked me if I'd be interested in detail to the
                    Pentagon. I said, “Sure, anyplace where I can work, so I don't have to walk the
                    halls,” which I hadn't done yet because I was on home leave. They told me the
                    job was Soviet/East European desk officer in the office of the Secretary of
                    Defense, which appealed to me because that was my original interest when I came
                    into the Foreign Service. I had done Russian and Balkan history at Wisconsin and
                    wrote my Master's thesis on U.S.-Albanian relations, but of course that
                    background played no part in the assignment whatsoever, because that was ancient
                    history. When I went over to be interviewed by the Brigadier who was acting
                    chief of Europe-NATO affairs at the time, he said, “You're kind of senior for
                    this position, aren't you?” And I said, “Yes, I am. But I don't mind. It's an
                    area I'm interested in and unlike you guys, we don't wear our rank on our sleeve
                    or our shoulder-boards. So it's okay with me.” With their consent, the
                    assignment went through.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I went over there in September of '82, at the conclusion of a couple of months of
                    home leave. It was just after Reagan had signed a new National Security Council
                    directive on differentiation among the Warsaw Pact countries. We were to treat
                    Romania better than the others because she was independent of the Soviet Union
                    in foreign policy, although a member of the Warsaw Pact. The Brigadier asked me
                    to set up a DOD-wide task force to see what the various elements of the Defense
                    Department was doing to implement or at least to observe this National Security
                    directive—giving me the impression that he had reason to suspect that some parts
                    of DOD were probably not. In fact, I found out later that the office to which we
                    belonged had opposed this directive; went along with it very reluctantly and in
                    fact did everything it could to undermine the policy of differentiation. As far
                    as they were concerned, any member of the Warsaw Pact, was equally bad.</p>
                <p>I put together a task force with representatives from the Army, Navy, Air Force,
                    DIA, other parts of OSD, including the part that dealt with strategic trade
                    controls, which was the part that had been most opposed to this policy. We had
                    weekly meetings. I would prepare an agenda, assign subjects, and we'd get
                    together once a week. I chaired this task force, which started out with all the
                    representatives at the colonel level, the typical action-officer level in the
                    Pentagon. As the months wore on, these colonels started sending lieutenant
                    colonels and majors. DIA was very good and kept up a good level of
                    participation. I would write up papers for discussion and the day before the
                    meeting run them all around that huge building, putting a lot of miles on my
                    shoes.</p>
                <p>Over time, we put together a sort of inventory of what each of these elements of
                    the Defense Department was doing with regard to the Warsaw Pact countries. And
                    some discussion of to what extent these operations or actions conformed with the
                    differentiation policy. By the time we worked through all this information and
                    discussed its relevance to the policy, it was clear that several of the offices
                    didn't like the policy and were not supporting it in any way, were ignoring it
                    as much as they could. I drafted a paper about what would need to be done to
                    bring all these different programs into compliance with the directive. From a
                    couple of the offices the answer came back that unless their bosses were
                    convinced that my bosses were serious about implementing this, they were not to
                    participate any longer in the task force. I wrote all this up. It went up to
                    Perle, who was the Assistant Secretary for Defense; Richard Perle, the same one
                    who had been at the luncheon in London several years before, and then to go on
                    to his boss, Fred Ikl�, who was the Under Secretary for Policy. It never got
                    beyond Perle's office. I could never get them even to look at it because I don't
                    think they were that interested. The strategic trade control office, which was
                    really the main offender of this policy, came under Perle as well and acted with
                    his full blessing. Steve Bryan, who was an associate of Perle's on Capitol Hill,
                    ran the strategic trade control office. While my immediate bosses in the
                    Europe-NATO shop were sympathetic, and indeed had launched the whole project, at
                    the next level up, the Perle level, there was no interest. The whole thing died
                    on the vine just about the time I finished my assignment over there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue? Romania was a country without much
                        economic power, were we supposed to be selling things to Romania that we
                        weren't selling to the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes, that was specifically provided for in this National Security
                    directive. That the Romanians could be trusted to protect technology that we
                    were not willing to sell to other Warsaw Pact countries. One of the specific
                    issues was that Nixon, when he went there as President, told them the United
                    States would provide Land-Sat, one of the satellite technologies useful in
                    mapping out agricultural areas, mineral resources and whatnot, through the
                    photography from this Land-Sat satellite. That we would provide them an imaging
                    station and give them access to all the data generated, which could in any case
                    be purchased commercially in the U.S. The Office of Strategic Trade Controls
                    over there opposed it. The principal but unstated reason they were opposed was
                    not because they honestly believed Romania would pass this technology on, but
                    because of Romania's record on Jewish emigration. Perle claimed to be the author
                    of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perle himself was Jewish, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Yes...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and was a very strong...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: Steve Bryan also. The Romanian government was letting Jews emigrate only
                    upon payment of large sums to reimburse the country for their education, because
                    they said that Jewish emigration constitutes a brain-drain of some of the best
                    educated people in the country, and that education cost Romania a lot of money.
                    Now they were going to take their education abroad. They charged them large sums
                    before they could get an exit permit to go here or emigrate to Israel. In most
                    cases, those payments had to be paid either by relatives or by Jewish
                    organizations, and this was the issue which I believe was most important to
                    Perle. The military services were not opposed because they said Land-Sat
                    technology was outdated, and the Soviets already had much more advanced
                    satellite imagery. Our DIA participants had evidence that the Romanians were not
                    sharing intelligence or industrial information with the Soviets or any of the
                    other Warsaw Pact countries. But Romania had this terrible blot on its shield on
                    Jewish emigration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Romania, in retrospect, had probably one of the
                        worst human rights records of the whole bloc under Ceausescu but, was this a
                        factor particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>SULSER: Jewish emigration was one aspect of this, but it was the aspect that
                    particularly concerned this office, because of the fact that under Jackson-Vanik
                    you cannot provide MFN treatment to countries that don't permit free emigration.
                    So Romania suffered under that. DOD was supported in this by our Ambassador
                    there, much to the chagrin of the State Department. Funderburk was the
                    Ambassador, spoke the language from having gone to school there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SULSER: He sympathized with this stonewalling position of the Pentagon. The State
                    Department was not happy with his position at all because he was not supporting
                    established NSC policy, White House policy signed by Ronald Reagan!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Pentagon view the Soviet threat in those days,
                        '82-'84?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SULSER: They put out these annual publications, “Soviet Military Power,” which I
                    was involved in editing the first year I was there. They brought a woman over
                    from CIA to edit it the next year. Everybody from Weinberger on down had a very
                    strong position on the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact and did not to any
                    extent see the East European countries as being in any significant way free of
                    Soviet influence or penetration. They regarded the military forces of those
                    countries as 100% additions to Soviet power. On the other hand, the intelligence
                    community, including DIA, was regularly turning out studies on the reliability
                    or lack thereof of the other Warsaw Pact countries to the Soviet Union.
                    Weinberger, for example, referred to Jaruzelski as a “Russian general in a
                    Polish uniform” without regard to intelligence community assessments that in
                    imposing martial law in Poland he may well have averted a Soviet military
                    takeover, a Soviet invasion of the country. In other words, they had no room for
                    any doubt as far as these Eastern Europeans were concerned. They were all part
                    of the enemy, and they were non-cooperative to the maximum extent. I never felt
                    that my position over there as Soviet-East European desk officer was of any
                    importance or relevance at all, because Weinberger, Ikl�, Perle, were convinced
                    they knew all they needed to know about that part of the world, and certainly
                    didn't need any advice from any Foreign Service type.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself treated with almost suspicion?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>SULSER: No, not really. Lack of interest, yes. The people in my immediate office,
                    the Europe-NATO shop, treated me fine, but at those higher levels there was
                    never any desire to hear any advice from me or anything like that, or any
                    evaluation even, much less advice. However, when I retired I was awarded the
                    Secretary of Defense medal for meritorious service, accompanied by a beautiful
                    citation signed by Weinberger recounting my “achievements.” For the most part I
                    was restricted to arranging appointments, briefings and things like that for our
                    ambassadors going out to those countries to call on Weinberger, or Carlucci, or
                    sometimes on Perle or Ikl�. I'd arrange appointments and briefings for them with
                    DIA and whatnot about the military situation in the country they were going to.
                    And then this little task force that never amounted to anything. Carlucci made a
                    visit to Yugoslavia very early on during my time there. I did a briefing book
                    for him. That was not part of the Warsaw Pact, so it was not technically covered
                    by the policy of differentiation, but was a country that we had supported under
                    Tito for a good many years in order to maintain their independence from the
                    Soviets and their Warsaw Pact neighbors. We had military assistance programs
                    there which were not being implemented because these very hard-liners in the
                    Pentagon were convinced that Yugoslavia was training Palestinian terrorists.
                    There was some evidence that Palestinians went to military training schools in
                    Yugoslavia, so as long as the Yugoslavs were providing assistance to the
                    Palestinians, the Pentagon was not interested in implementing this long-standing
                    U.S.-Yugoslav military consultation or assistance program.</p>
                <p>Poland during the martial law was another big thing. I represented the Pentagon
                    on several inter-agency task forces to plan how we were going to exploit the
                    first anniversary of martial law. We had numerous meetings, came up with all
                    sorts of ideas and memos and contingency plans, only to have the Poles cancel
                    martial law on the eve of the anniversary! Must have disappointed an awful lot
                    of people in some of these agencies.</p>
                <p>But no, I never felt any attitude of suspicion there. Once in a while I'd be
                    instructed not to say something to my colleagues in the State Department. I was
                    told from the beginning that the State Department was not to know about this
                    task force. I never did mention it to anybody in the State Department while I
                    was still in the Service. I was loyal to my masters, as far as that was
                    concerned. As I say, I felt they didn't need me for anything but the most
                    routine activity. But for me it was an interesting way to spend my last year and
                    a half in the Foreign Service and to be reading all the telegrams from all the
                    posts in parts of the world where I had once had a major interest. Astonished to
                    find how little had changed in all those years, still the same systems, the same
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Since retiring in 1984, I've been astonished at how rapidly things have changed.
                    Not for a few years, but certainly from 1989 onwards.</p>

                        excellent.</hi>
