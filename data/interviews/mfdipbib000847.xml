                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. Peter K. Murphy, of Massachusetts, is a retired Senior
                        Foreign Service Officer (Minister Counselor) whose career encompasses three
                        assignments in France, three in Italy, Argentina, Germany, the Holy See as
                        well as in the United States. Mr. Murphy retired from the United States
                        Foreign Service in 1991 and is now employed with a private firm - Stanley
                        Associates, Inc. of Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. Murphy lives in Boston and
                        works in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Peter, it is good to welcome you on this lovely spring day.</p>
                <p>MURPHY: Thank you, Bill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are here to record some of your memories of your days
                        in the Foreign Service of our nation. Let's start first with your
                        explanation of what brought you to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well...for that - we should go back a bit in time. I'm originally from
                    the Boston area. I was born in Medford, Massachusetts - a suburb of Boston - and
                    was raised and educated in the nearby town of Winchester. Strange as it may
                    seem, throughout my grammar school years - and continuing right through high
                    school and college - I had an interest in foreign lands, cultures and peoples.
                    When I was in the fifth grade of grammar school - together with two school chums
                    - I joined the International Friendship League on Mount Vernon Street in Boston.
                    Through this organization I was put in contact with students my own age around
                    the world. I recall writing regularly to a fellow in Tokyo - who later turned
                    out to be a rather noted Japanese baseball player. A young man I also wrote to
                    in Le Havre, France became a lifelong friend - as is an Italian lawyer I
                    corresponded with for years in Rome. I have visited both of these friends over
                    the years - and know them and their families well.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I guess you could say that my interest in “lands beyond the sea” was also
                    manifest in my decision to leave Boston College - in Chestnut Hill,
                    Massachusetts - at the end of my sophomore year to enter a Catholic missionary
                    order - the Maryknoll Fathers. I remained ass a seminarian at the Maryknoll
                    Seminary (The Venard) in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania for only one year before
                    concluding that I had no real vocation to the priesthood. I have, however, no
                    regret whatsoever at having spent that year of study in Pennsylvania. I learned
                    a lot - and also met interesting men from around the country - some of whom have
                    remained life-long friends. My studies in Clarks Summit were geared to overseas
                    living; life among other peoples and cultures. This part of my studies
                    fascinated me - more so than the heavy dose of Latin - although I am sure that
                    the concentrated study of the Latin language assisted me with my French,
                    Italian, Spanish and German in later Foreign Service life!</p>
                <p>A key catalyst to my interest in foreign affairs and cultures was Dorothea Wool.
                    Dorothea Wool was a Foreign Service Officer from the Boston area....the first
                    FSO I had ever met. Her cousin, Clifton Keane, was our next door neighbor in
                    Winchester, Massachusetts. From time to time, Dorothea returned to the Boston
                    area on her Home Leave. During those periods when she was visiting her family in
                    Winchester, she spoke at length to me about her work in our embassies Indonesia,
                    India, and France ....and other exotic places. I was perhaps in the seventh or
                    eighth grade at the time - a most impressionable age, Bill! So - - it was
                    through Miss Wool that I first became interested in the Foreign Service as a
                    possible career choice. When I graduated from Boston College with a Bachelor of
                    Arts degree in English literature, I made application to the Department of
                    State. The whole process seemed very complicated to me at the time but our then
                    Senator - John F. Kennedy - was most helpful sending me the necessary
                    information to make application to enter the State Department. I recall that he
                    sent me a follow-up letter of encouragement after my application was made.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>During the long waiting period to enter the Foreign Service, I did a variety of
                    things. For a few months I was a “sales management trainee” with DuPont Paint
                    Company. Following this experience (which quickly convinced me that I wanted
                    nothing at all to do with sales of any sort!!) I became a substitute teacher of
                    French and Latin in Lexington, Winchester and Medford, Massachusetts High
                    Schools. These were “filler” jobs until the date arrived for me to embark on a
                    five month trip to Europe. In order to make this trip, I was obliged to receive
                    the permission of my local Selective Service Board to leave the country - and
                    promise that I would enter military service upon my return! To tell the truth,
                    Bill - this first trip to Europe was like a dream come true for me! To earn the
                    funds for such a voyage, I worked for three months in the summer as a bartender
                    in an exclusive club on Cape Cod (Oyster Harbors Club in Osterville) and saved
                    every penny for my great adventure. I also spent many hours during that long,
                    hot summer on Cape Cod planning my “trip of a lifetime.” I booked passage (for
                    $175) Third Class from New York to Southampton, UK on the SS Liberte of the
                    French Line (Compagnie Generale Transatlantique ....which no longer exists -
                    alas!) Off I went with $1,200 in my pocket - a fortune in those days! I guess I
                    thought of myself as a reincarnation of Richard Haliburton - whose travel books
                    I had devoured as a child. Aboard ship I had with me a newfangled European
                    railway ticket which was called a Eurail Pass. Prior to leaving Boston, I saw an
                    add in the New York Times and purchased what turned out to be the third
                    Eurailpass ever issued - - for a total of $125 - for a three month validity.
                    (They surely lost money on me!!) The crossing of the Atlantic was an adventure
                    in itself: new food (wine with every meal - can you imagine the impression for a
                    young guy from Boston!), new friends, many students - both American and foreign.
                    Very little sleeping was accomplished on the crossing - - but there were lots of
                    parties and even more dancing. (I was not very good — and never improved much in
                    that field!)</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>I shall never forget my impressions of arriving in Southampton at 4:00 AM in the
                    cold, damp fog of an October morning and climbing into a tender to go ashore -
                    (too few passengers were disembarking at that port to permit a formal call
                    inside the port at quay-side.) My first steps onto the soil of the “Old World”
                    remains vividly implanted in my mind even to this day! I recall the kindness of
                    the British customs officers who offered me and my four companions from the ship
                    a mug of hot English tea - which tasted so good that early in the morning after
                    a week of little sleep on the ship! The views of the English countryside - of
                    Eaton (where the “battles of the Empire were won on those playing fields”!)- and
                    farmlands - and the quaint English villages and houses with thatched roofs which
                    raced past our window as our train rushed towards London! To me - this was
                    really traveling!! Today's travel by jet aircraft - while admittedly far easier
                    and swifter - does not lend itself to the adventure of actually traversing the
                    miles to a foreign land. I spent a lot of time exploring London, several weeks
                    at Jesus College at Oxford University - where I took a literature course - and
                    also visited family friends in Kings Lynn in Norfolk. Every day was a new
                    adventure - from bring treated by the English Heath System at no charge! — to
                    visiting the Boston “Stump” (as the tower of the Cathedral at Boston is called)
                    and the ruins of old Castle Rising in Norfolk - - and the Abbey and Shrine at
                    Walsingham - - and the unforgettable Christmas Carol Service I attended at Kings
                    College at Cambridge. All these memories of my first taste of life in a foreign
                    land became an intimate part of my being...and convinced me - (if I needed more
                    convincing) that the Foreign Service was for me!</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>From England I crossed the English Channel (by ferry, of course! There was no
                    Chunnel in those days!). I visited my pen-friend in Le Havre for a week. I was
                    received as a member of his family - - in spite of the fact that his mother - a
                    noted French artist - had died three weeks previously. I visited the city of Le
                    Havre and was struck at how much of it was destroyed in World War II - - and
                    especially how ugly the reconstructed city was! Henri Michel Guerbette and his
                    friends showed me much of the beautiful province of Normandy - from Etretat,
                    Fecamp to Bayeux and Caen. Everything was a wonder to me - - including the newly
                    constructed Pont de Tocqueville over the Seine. From Le Havre I went to explore
                    the wonders of Paris, Amsterdam, Germany - skied in Garmish Partenkirchen in the
                    Bavarian Alps. I saw the beauty and experienced the mystery of Vienna, which, in
                    1959, still had Soviet troops, stationed in the city mounting an honor guard at
                    an imposing monument to their fallen colleagues in World War II. Then - on to
                    Italy which fast became my first love - and remains such to this day. I began in
                    Venice and, in the brilliant sunshine of late November - explored every nook and
                    cranny of that fascinating city. I took the “vaporetto” everywhere - including
                    the island of Murano and also out to the Lido of Venice. After all - I didn't
                    want to miss the scene of “Death in Venice”. From Venice - to Florence - where I
                    explored that city by foot for four days. Then I took the train to Rome and
                    arrived at the Stazione Termini (Mussolini's grand construction) about midnight
                    on the first day of what happened to be the first day of a State Visit by
                    President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The city was at its most glorious and fully
                    decked out in American and Italian flags. I easily found a cab driver near the
                    station. The driver agreed to give me a midnight tour of the city .....for a
                    pack of Marlboro cigarettes! All the historic Roman monuments were lit for
                    Eisenhower's visit and they sparkled in the soft rain. I remember driving into
                    St. Peter's Square and viewing Michelangelo's masterpiece for the first time in
                    the shimmering light through the falling rain. To me - just being there in that
                    historic city was like a dream come true but I also recall the acute sadness I
                    felt at not being able to share my happiness and wonder with members of my
                    family - or good friends.</p>
                <p>After seeing the Roman Forum and other sites of the city, I arrived at my hotel -
                    - a student hostel called the Palazzo Salviati - located on the banks of the
                    Tiber near the Vatican and the Castel S. Angelo. The palazzo had formerly been
                    used by Mussolini as a training school for officers - and later was turned into
                    a student hostel. I remained in Rome for three unforgettable weeks and, given my
                    curious nature, I don't think I missed too much!! Again - I want to emphasize my
                    one constant regret at the time - - that I was in Rome alone and could not share
                    my experience. I did try - by writing home often - but it was never the same.
                    Whoever wrote that joy must be shared to be fully enjoyed, was right on the
                    mark!</p>
                <p>On a sun-filled Roman November morning, I stood in St. Peter's Square with
                    hundreds of other onlookers as President Eisenhower arrived for his historic
                    meeting with Pope John XXIII. Little did I know it that day, but years later I
                    would work closely (both in Rome and again in Bonn) with the President's
                    interpreter for the meeting with the Pope that morning at the Vatican - -General
                    Vernon A. Walters.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>A great guide to Rome was my old pen-friend from grammar school days who had
                    recently become an attorney, married and completed his military service...Avv.
                    Carlo Martino. Carlo introduced me to members of his extended family which was
                    originally from Salerno where his father had been the mayor of the city -
                    including his brother - Renato R. Martino. Renato was then a young
                    priest-student at Papal Ecclesiastical Diplomatic College for Nobles (as it was
                    then called) - an elite school for the training of papal diplomats. He was also
                    a graduate of the famed Collegio Capranica. Renato seemed to have more free time
                    than his brother (priests usually do!) and was my guide in Rome and also the
                    “Castelli” towns around Rome. As he spoke not a word of English, we conversed in
                    French (mine was rather “fractured French” in those days!) Before leaving Rome
                    to return to England, I bought Renato an Italian-English dictionary. I presented
                    it to him with the remark that if he really wanted to become a successful Papal
                    diplomat, he had better learn English! He took my advice. Today Renato is a
                    Papal Nuncio (Nuncio is how Papal ambassadors are styled — from the Latin “to
                    announce”) at the United Nations in New York assigned as the head of the Holy
                    See's Permanent Observer Delegation - a culmination of a career of service for
                    the Holy See at diplomatic posts in Lebanon, Brazil, Canada, and Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now that you have outlined what brought you to the
                        American Foreign Service, Peter, tell us a bit about the “early days” in
                        that Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: When I first joined the Foreign Service in February of 1962, the State
                    Department's budget was very tight. (Insiders who will read this statement will,
                    no doubt, comment “So what else is new”!) There was no money that year to send
                    us abroad - - - so, together with four colleagues, I was sent to work for the
                    first six months in the Service to the New York Passport Agency. For me, at
                    least, this assignment was almost akin to a foreign assignment! The city of New
                    York was overwhelming and the work at the Passport Agency was beyond belief. I
                    normally arrived at work about 8:00 AM to find a mob of at least 200 people
                    waiting at the doors. The Agency was located just opposite St. Patrick's
                    Cathedral on Fifth Avenue - - in the building with the heroic statue of Atlas in
                    the front.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think this was the Foreign Service or did you
                        think this was the Civil Service?</hi>

                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>MURPHY: All I can tell you, Bill, is that it was all “foreign” to me!! Within
                    three weeks of my arrival in the city, my photo - together with Mr. Krishna
                    Menon, the then Prime Minister (or was it Foreign Minister?) of India - ended up
                    in the New York Times! In the photo, Menon was pictured hitting me over the head
                    with his walking cane. Let me hasten to explain! The Director of the New York
                    Passport Agency at the time was a well known character named Joseph Callahan.
                    Everyone in New York state knew Joe Callahan and he was invited everywhere,
                    including, of course, to most diplomatic functions in the city. One evening
                    Callahan was unable to attend a reception for Mr. Menon at the Indian Embassy
                    (to the United Nations) and he asked if I would like to go in his place.
                    Naturally, I was delighted - - but I recall thinking at the time that it was a
                    bit odd to be attending a reception for Menon who, at the time, was most
                    anti-American in his public statements and actions. He was highly criticized in
                    the American press. It so happened that Menon arrived at the Indian Ambassador's
                    residence just about the same time as me. Quite a large pool of journalists and
                    photographers had gathered by the steps of the building. As Menon was climbing
                    the steps, the press screamed questions at him. I was walking up the steps just
                    after him. Menon turned suddenly as he reached the top step. With his walking
                    cane, he took a swipe at the journalists while, at the same time, yelling an
                    obscenity. I was stunned by the flash of the photographers cameras - - but
                    continued into the building after him. In the photo which was published in the
                    papers the next day, it looked as if Menon was about to take my head off with
                    his cane! No other proof was needed, said the article, to prove the
                    anti-American sentiment of this arrogant Indian Minister! Needless to say, the
                    article caused a lot of comment from Washington and my hometown!.</p>
                <p>I only remained in New York for about four months, and assisted the Passport
                    Agency during its “busy crunch season”. Four months was quite enough; I resolved
                    never to work in a Passport Agency again - if I could help it!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those were the days that the Passport Office was managed
                        in Washington by somebody who didn't necessarily associate herself with the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. My authorization to adjudicate passport applications was signed
                    and sealed by Miss. Frances Knight - a very close friend of J. Edgar Hoover,
                    Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Miss Knight, as Director of U.
                    S. Passport Services was technically under the jurisdiction of the Administrator
                    of Consular and Security Affairs (the actual title in those days) in the
                    Department of State. In reality - Miss Knight answered to no one. She ruled the
                    Passport Office with an iron hand and tales of her modus operandi are
                    legion.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>I really received a very negative impression of the State Department by being
                    first introduced to work in the New York Passport Agency. Its was like hell
                    going to work there everyday. Lines of applicants - winding around Rockefeller
                    Plaza - waited for us each day. They must have formed at 7:00 AM - because by
                    the time I got to work at 8:00 AM, there must have been 200 people in line.
                    Later in my career, of course, I learned that 200 people waiting for a service
                    was just a drop in the bucket....when one considers lines in Havana, Warsaw,
                    Santo Domingo or Manila.! What really shocked me was the rudeness of the
                    government employees.... the permanent employees, the Civil Servants ...of the
                    New York Passport Agency. They would most curt with the public and treated
                    people as if they were doing them a favor to speak with them. I guess I had lead
                    a very sheltered life - up to that point - because I seemed to find just about
                    everyone in New York very rude!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just back to one point. You said that at the Passport
                        Agency in New York, and other passport offices, were part of the Bureau of
                        Consular Affairs. I would think that this experience in consular work would
                        have turned you off. Why did you continue your career in the “consular
                        field”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I've always enjoyed working with people. I certainly could see no other
                    part of the Foreign Service in which one works so closely with the public than
                    in the consular field. I believe that was the main attraction for me. I think
                    also that I had an ulterior motive: I figured that if you are going to live and
                    work in a foreign land - the very best way to get to know the native mentality
                    is to be with the natives of that country as much as possible. Asking around the
                    State Department, I found that the other sections of the Embassy did not have
                    the daily contact with the public that was available to a consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Despite this negative first impression in New York?.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. It really was a negative first impression. First of all, if I can go
                    back a bit: it was not simply the fact that we worked in a sweat-shop atmosphere
                    for eight hours a day or that the working conditions were horrendous - and the
                    “customers” constantly agitated. There were other factors which made our lives
                    in New York City most difficult. If you can believe it, Bill, it took the
                    Department of State three months to send us our first paycheck to New York. All
                    four of us who were sent there on TDY were young, aspiring - and very poor
                    members of the Foreign Service - - living in one of the most expensive cities in
                    the world. We depended heavily on our families to help us out and shared many
                    rather basic home-made meals together during the long three month period.
                    Looking back - - we did have a great time. One of the fellows was from New York
                    so it was natural that he became our ring leader. We were rarely in bed before
                    2:00 in the morning!! We went to Broadway shows and various concerts- always
                    buying the cheapest tickets. Together we explored the wonders of Greenwich
                    Village and Soho. I began to think that New Yorkers never slept. This shows you
                    how provincial we were in Boston at the time! All this was very new to me.
                    So...although we worked hard - we also played hard. What the heck - we were
                    young, Bill!! If you can't enjoy yourself then - when can you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as a reward for this extraordinary effort - you got
                        Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well....I don't know how it came about but - yes - I did get Paris!I had
                    studied French both in high school and at the university - - but, as you know,
                    Bill, American language students of that era might have known something of the
                    foreign language - - but were far from fluent! So - - after a few short weeks in
                    Washington and no additional language training ....I was off to my first Foreign
                    Service post —Paris, France! I flew from Boston via Shannon, Ireland. I well
                    recall my first day in the city - a warm October (10/11062) afternoon. After
                    checking into my hotel - the Hotel de l'Arcade just around the corner from the
                    church of the Madeleine, I took a long stroll through the Jardins des Tuilleries
                    and up and down the Quais along the Seine to Notre Dame Cathedral. My first meal
                    - a three course pris fixe cost just 11F50......you can tell by the price, Bill,
                    that it was a long time ago!</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>You'll recall that I earlier spoke of a Foreign Service Officer - Dorothea Wool -
                    who first interested me in the Foreign Service. Amazingly enough - Dorothea was
                    stationed at the Embassy in Paris at the time of my arrival. On my first day at
                    work in the Embassy, I walked into her office. Dorothea, at that time, held the
                    position of Publications Procurement Officer within the Political Section. This
                    was a rather unique position which I doubt exists in any embassy these days. She
                    was responsible for the purchase of publications, maps, books on political and
                    economic subjects which would be of interesting to official Washington
                    readership - e.g. Department's Historian, the Department's Office of
                    Intelligence and Research, the Central Intelligence Agency or the National
                    Security Council. Dorothea's territory encompassed not only Western Europe - but
                    most of the Communist block. She was, as a result, on the road much of the time.
                    When I walked into her office at the Embassy and she said, “My God, Peter, it's
                    good to see you. What are you doing these days?” She about fell over when I told
                    her that I had joined the Foreign Service and was now assigned to Paris. In the
                    early days of my tour, Dorothea was a fount of information and advice. I often
                    regret not having followed one of her suggestions: she had purchased a small
                    apartment in Paris and used the government Housing Allowance we all received to
                    pay off her mortgage. Would that I had done the same in 1962; think of its value
                    today!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Miss Wool never knew that she was the inspiration which
                        caused you to enter the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, I don't think that I every really came out and told her that. She
                    died, unfortunately, of cancer a few years later. My first assignment at the
                    Embassy was to the Passport and Citizenship Office of the Consular Section. At
                    that time, the office was located on the ground floor of the main Chancery at 8,
                    Avenue Gabriel on the historic Place de la Concorde. I still get a thrill just
                    thinking that I once went to work every day in such a historic location! We are
                    indeed fortunate in the Foreign Service, aren't we!! How any of our peers from
                    university days can boast of such “work” experiences, Bill!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very true! Were you assigned to the Passport
                        Section of the Embassy based on your experience in the New York Passport
                        Agency?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I suppose that was the logic of the assignment - if there is indeed logic
                    to most Foreign Service assignments!! I seem to recall that the Office of
                    Personnel in the Embassy had a lot to do with the assignments of new employees
                    within the Embassy in those days. At that time, the Consular Section in Paris
                    was an enormous entity. We had a total, I believe, of 18 or 19 officers and at
                    least 30 Foreign Service National employees, or “ Locals” as they were called
                    then... (since we are recording history)!</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>The Consul General was Herbert Fales. To a newly arrived officer at such a large
                    Embassy, the Consul General was a daunting personage indeed ! We peons rarely
                    saw him in the office - - and, I soon got the impression that his job seemed to
                    consist mainly of acting as the Embassy liaison with the large and influential
                    resident American community in Paris.....at those days about 52,000 strong in
                    Paris and the surrounding area. You must not forget that this was before NATO
                    was invited to leave French territory by General de Gaulle. I had the distinct
                    impression that the Consul General spent much of his time at luncheons and
                    attending receptions and formal dinners. Come to think of it - - I don't think
                    that it was far from the truth!!</p>
                <p>Fales had a deputy named John Gossett, the Deputy Consul General (his actual
                    title). It was he who was responsible for the daily operation of the Consular
                    Section. There was also another interesting officer - whose name I have
                    forgotten - who was a professional psychiatrist. This fellow was assigned by the
                    Department to Embassy Paris at the insistence of Miss Frances Knight (of
                    Passport fame!) to examine cases of lost passports in an attempt to determine
                    the main reasons why young American tourists and students were losing their
                    passports with such frequency. You remember, Bill, that we are speaking of 1962
                    - about the beginning of the discovery of Europe by American university
                    students. The Embassy in Paris was experiencing the first wave of American
                    student backpackers - and visitors to European Youth Hostels. European youths,
                    Germans especially, had been traveling and seeing the world in this manner for
                    generations - but our young Americans were just beginning to arrive in droves.
                    The days of the “Grand Tour” - both for the British and the Americans had come
                    to an end. Transatlantic fares were beginning to become more reasonable. Passage
                    by ship from New York was even cheap as I have noted in my personal experience.
                    The State Department seemed to be at a loss to understand why these young people
                    managed to lose these “valuable documents” - passports - with such frequency. We
                    tried to explain - - via Airgram - the normal mode of communications at the time
                    - that most of the young people we saw in Europe carried their passports
                    sticking out the back pockets of their blue jeans or shorts - - and were thus
                    easy pray for pickpockets. The Bureau of Consular Affairs (Passport Directorate)
                    thought there must be more to it - so the psychiatrist was sent to Paris.
                    Needless to say, I don't believe it was a very successful study. The numbers of
                    Lost Passport cases simply increased in leaps and bounds during the next ten
                    years..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that behind this was an assumption that the
                        young people were selling their passports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, there was a suspicion of sale of passports, but I never did see
                    much proof of widespread sale - in Western Europe, at least. The document was,
                    of course, quite valuable in the Middle East and in certain parts of Asia. Our
                    goal in Paris was to attempt to devise ways to impress the traveling public -
                    and especially the youth - the value of the Passport and to suggest ways it
                    should safeguarded. We attempted to encourage CA to mount a media campaign in
                    the United States - to no avail. Such a step was considered, at the time, to be
                    far too revolutionary.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work, Peter? And what was your other work in
                        Paris like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: When we finished interviewing a person who had lost their passport and a
                    determination of citizenship made - the applicant would then go on to a second
                    interview with our in-house psychiatrist. It was his task to attempt to discover
                    the reasons the applicant thought so little of the document that he/she did not
                    guard it with his life!</p>
                <p>Life in the Consular Section in Paris was a far cry to what it is today, Bill.
                    For example, we young officers were never allowed to sign a letter destined to
                    the United States. Such letters were signed only by the Consul General or by the
                    Deputy Consul General. I am sure you well remember how it was: one simple reply
                    to a logical question reached the desk of the responsible “signer” with 1) the
                    original letter 2) the draft reply 3) the original reply with about five back up
                    copies containing the names of the drafting officer plus those who had cleared
                    the letter and permitted it to be typed in “final form”. There was an Embassy
                    File Room - which kept track of every piece of paper generated by the entire
                    mission!! How often those letters were returned to the drafter with a request of
                    a word or phrase change. Thank God for Word Processors! It is so much easier
                    today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this process a local Paris directive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - I believe it was local. When a letter arrived at the Embassy, it
                    took almost two to three weeks for an answer to get out because it was typed in
                    the bowels of the Consular Section and slowly wound its way up to be approved by
                    various officers before it reached the desk of the Consul General or his Deputy
                    for signature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this restriction over fear that you might say
                        something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I think it was. I think basically we young officers were forbidden to
                    sign letters out of a fear that we might state something on paper which was
                    contrary to government policy. I guess it was thought that such a letter might
                    end up in the hands of a Member of Congress ! We were, however, allowed to write
                    directly to Americans resident or traveling in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe it really did have something to with
                        Congressmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Maybe so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this only in the citizenship and passport world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, this procedure was in effect throughout in the entire Consular
                    Section.</p>
                <p>I worked in the Passport Unit of the Consular Section for almost a year. I liked
                    the work very much. If you can picture it - - we were six officers interviewing
                    all Passport applicants at desks! Our customers sat before us - - and we quizzed
                    them - especially regarding possible Loss of Citizenship. We had a raft of
                    questions we posed: regarding voting in foreign elections, acceptance of foreign
                    citizenship, seeking the “benefits” of a foreign citizenship in the form of
                    privilege, position or financial benefits (French Social Security, for example).
                    I had very interesting customers from time to time. Several were elderly members
                    of the “Lost Generation” who had been in Paris since the turn of the century.
                    Most of them were dying off by the time I arrived - but a few characters were
                    still about. Picasso also came in to the office one day - and I recall that a
                    colleague asked for his autograph on the back of a check. The artist obliged
                    with a small sketch - which must be worth a fortune today! I met John Marquand,
                    the writer; Lionel Trilling, the critic, as well as many of the noted artists
                    and actors of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many resident Americans would you say there were in
                        Paris in the early ''60s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Residents.... at least 50,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not just students passing through?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, these were businessmen , their families, the large US military
                    contingent at NATO Headquarters plus a very large population of wealthy citizens
                    who had lived there for years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And died there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: And were born there and died there; and fell ill, and were thrown in
                    jail, and were robbed and married......every facet of consular work was
                    represented.....even Shipping and Seamen - - as the port of Le Havre was within
                    the Consular District and, of course, the large steamships were still crossing
                    the Atlantic to New York in those days.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>The remnants of the “Lost Generation” who visited the Embassy were very colorful
                    - and really extraordinary characters. Several used to line up each month to
                    collect their Social Security checks. (This was in the days before direct bank
                    deposits were in effect!) I well remember the periodic visits of Raymond Duncan
                    - brother of the actress/dancer Isadora Duncan. Raymond was about 78 years old
                    at the time and he would traipse in to the Consular Section with a group of
                    followers to collect their checks. It was indeed a sight to behold: six to ten
                    men and women - in the dead of Paris winter - dressed in wool saris hand-woven
                    by themselves at the Isadora Duncan Cultural Center (rue du Dragon) on the Left
                    Bank near the Sorbonne. The French got a big kick out the spectacle. To me they
                    seemed like a group of Old Testament Prophets strolling the city streets. We had
                    many strange visitors to the Embassy.</p>
                <p>The Passport and Citizenship work in Paris was very heavy - especially due to the
                    presence of the US Military at the NATO bases near Paris. The Military even
                    stationed three enlisted men within the Consular Section to help us with the
                    hundreds Reports of Birth and new Passport applications received from the bases.
                    (You must remember that this was the height of the Baby Boom era - - and the US
                    military were certainly contributing!).</p>
                <p>Each action carried out in connection with the Passport and Citizenship work was
                    recorded (by manual typewriter) on a 6 x 8 card for our permanent files.
                    Thinking back on the system of keeping track of citizenship cases, it seems
                    extraordinarily old-fashioned. You must remember, however, that there were no
                    computers, FAX machines or instant communications. For example: a case of
                    suspected loss of nationality was investigated in Paris; written up on an
                    Operations Memorandum (OM) and dispatched by diplomatic pouch to CA in
                    Washington. By the time the Passport attorneys got around to answering the
                    communication - at least four months normally passed. In the meantime, if the
                    person had to travel, a Limited Passport was issued - “To be Extended in
                    Validity upon Receipt of a Determination of U. S. Citizenship from the
                    Department of State in Washington, DC”</p>
                <p>I learned much about citizenship law during my time in that unit in Paris. I also
                    learned a lot about the State Department bureaucracy - - as well as the press. I
                    vividly recall my boss being recalled to Washington for a major gaff involving
                    passport/citizenship work. The British-born, naturalized American actress -
                    Elizabeth Taylor - had informed the Embassy that she wished to renounce her U.
                    S. citizenship. In order to accommodate her wishes that there be no publicity
                    about this act, the Consul (Aaron Coleman) actually went to her hotel room to
                    have her execute the necessary documents of renunciation. Such a legal act
                    should have taken place on the Embassy premise, according to the lawyers in the
                    Passport Division of Consular Affairs. The affair was reported in the
                    international press and Mr. Coleman was reprimanded and ordered to return to
                    Washington. (You can see - Bill - there was no fooling around in those days! If
                    you broke the rules, you paid the price! Personnel would never have the
                    “audacity” to take such punitive action these days, don't you agree?)</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>After about a year in the passport and citizenship unit, I was assigned as number
                    two officer in the Office of Deaths and Estates. (I'll be there were not many
                    embassies at the time with a separate off ice dealing only with deceased
                    American citizens!) My supervisory colleague in that office was Margaret
                    Barnhart. The office was comprised of Peggy, myself and a French secretary. Poor
                    Cecile Tallibart - our secretary! She shed tears with every widow or widower who
                    walked through the door!. She was very sympathetic to all of our clients. When I
                    first was assigned to the job, I thought I would be bored silly as I didn't
                    think we'd have all that much business.... but in no time at all, I found
                    business to be booming!. I'd wager we had an average of three or four deaths a
                    week at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it wasn't simply the death or the widow? It was the
                        estates and the complexities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Even more than that, Bill. I don't know if this system existed elsewhere
                    in Western Europe at the time, but in Paris we worked with what we called
                    “Living Death Cases”. Americans - usually resident in Paris - would seek us out
                    to introduce us to their American or French attorneys and also to leave with our
                    office a copy of their Last Will and Testament. We were often given instructions
                    on the disposition of the physical estate in France - - and also detailed
                    instructions for the disposition of their remains and subsequent memorial
                    service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had some responsibility, I presume, over their wills
                        and their estates.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - according to regulations, we were obliged to protect the estates if
                    no family member was present. We were also charged with dispatching remains in
                    accord with the family's wishes. From time to time, I recall some of the odd
                    experiences I had in that position.</p>
                <p>You'll enjoy this little anecdote: a very strange and very wealthy women who
                    lived for many years near the Quai d'Orsay came to see me one day. She insisted
                    that I visit her apartment - together with her French Notaire - to take an
                    inventory of her estate and to review her Last Will and Testament. She wanted to
                    be absolutely sure that her government fully understood her Last Will in detail.
                    No sooner had we three gathered in her luxurious apartment overlooking the
                    Seine, than she started giving instructions: “This piece of furniture, this
                    Louis XV chair, will go to the Louvre; and this table or painting will go to the
                    National Gallery in Washington. We went through the entire apartment, taking
                    note of the disposition of her possessions. When we arrived at the beautiful,
                    mahogany-paneled library, and she said, “Now, Mr. Murphy - you see those volumes
                    of Shakespeare on the left. The third volume contains my husband's ashes. When
                    my time comes, I'd like the Embassy to give the funeral director orders to
                    cremate my remains. Then I want my ashes to be mixed together with those of my
                    late husband - - - and then flush us both down the toilet!” I was absolutely
                    speechless - - but later was assured by her Notaire that it was all perfectly
                    legal under French law - and that her Will contained exactly those
                    instructions!</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I feel I should comment here on an extraordinary event which occurred in November
                    of 1963 while I was assigned to Paris - the assassination of President John F.
                    Kennedy. We all recall “where we were” when we received this momentous and
                    devastating news. I had been invited, along with a few others from the Embassy,
                    to attend a reception at the British Embassy on the Faubourg St. Honore. A group
                    of us arrived at the Chancery at approximately 8:00 PM to be ushered into a room
                    full of perhaps 150 people - and which was as quiet as a morgue! Not having
                    heard the news of the shooting in Dallas, we thought it all very strange - -
                    until our host informed us of the news flash that had been received at the
                    Embassy a few minutes before we arrived. We, of course, left the party - and
                    went back to our chancery on Avenue Gabriel - where we received confirmation of
                    the shooting - and eventual death of President John F. Kennedy. The next few
                    days were frantic at the Embassy - for the entire staff. Endless lines of people
                    formed outside the Embassy - to express their condolences to our government and
                    the American people by signing a Condolence Book which had been opened in the
                    office of the Consul General - just inside the main Chancery of the Embassy. The
                    Ambassador asked the six youngest officers of the Embassy greet the public for
                    the four days before the funeral in Washington. Being one of the officers
                    chosen, I shall never forget experiencing the sincere sympathy and general
                    outpouring of affection for our nation as I spoke with French people from all
                    walks of life during those very sad days. Everyone waited in the same line....no
                    matter what their station in life. The entire French Cabinet came as a body; Mme
                    Yvonne De Gaulle, the Cardinal Archbishop of Paris, and hundreds of others. I
                    especially recall the presence of many of the old mayors of small towns along
                    the Normandy coast - (towns liberated by American Forces during World War II) -
                    who told me, with eyes full of tears, that they would never forget the heroic
                    sacrifices of our men during those dark days in French history. The day of the
                    State Funeral in Washington, the French government and diplomatic corps attended
                    a Funeral Mass held at the Cathedral of Notre Dame - the very heart of France
                    and the central focus of French history throughout the ages. . Together with
                    other Embassy officers, I served as an usher at the cathedral on that
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>It was also during this trying period that I first met my wife, Jacqueline
                    (Senouillet). Working in the Embassy Personnel Section, she, too, was pressed
                    into service with the reception of the French public visiting the Chancery. Thus
                    - this very sad occasion held a silver lining for me!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, let me stop here. As the reader will discover from
                        your subsequent assignments - many of them in consular affairs - that you
                        have seen tremendous changes in the Consular Function over the years. I
                        would like you to cite some of the differences between those days in Paris
                        and today. One - we've just cited some incredibly, almost if not illegal,
                        functions that you performed. Secondly, you experienced a tremendous
                        bureaucracy at the time in Paris, by having your letters delayed and delayed
                        in getting to the American recipient. And, thirdly, a sort of direction, I
                        would argue, that failed to involved the officers and the troops in the
                        leadership of the Consular Section. Do you want to summarize at this point,
                        or look forward from the days in Paris, where you just stopped the clock and
                        gave us some very wonderful insight into what it has evolved into today, at
                        least in terms of those things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The differences between then - and now - in the consular field are
                    tremendous - as you say, Bill. As I was fortunate to have served twice at our
                    Embassy in Paris, I am in a rather unique position to make a comparison. Even
                    today, I am relatively familiar with the personnel composition of that Mission.
                    One of the major differences between my first and second tour in Paris, Bill, is
                    the size of the staff - both American and French. Layers of useless bureaucracy
                    have been eliminated - very justly so, in my opinion. While consular workloads
                    have indeed increased greatly - the number of people providing the public with
                    service has diminished. You might ask: What has been lost with these cutbacks?
                    For one thing - no consular officer in Paris (or in any large post these days)
                    receives the public in a private office - at their desk - as in the “old days” -
                    Granted.....a certain charm and graciousness has indeed been lost. However -
                    budgets do not allow for such niceties. Of necessity, the Department of State
                    has had to cut back. “ Speed - efficient provision of services” - are the key
                    words these days. “Diplomatic form”, if you will, is sorely lacking in most
                    consular sections around the world today. The pace and tenor of the work has
                    also changed. The days of the Grand Tour of Europe are over. Today's charter
                    flights from Dulles Airport, JFK, Logan and O'Hare are filled to capacity with
                    young - and also older - Americans seeking the pleasure of a holiday or study in
                    a foreign land. Nowhere is too remote or too uncivilized for many Americans
                    today. Often - the more remote and uncivilized - the better!! The services our
                    government offers the public have - of necessity - been reduced. We no longer,
                    for example, accept the public's Last Wills and Testaments for “safekeeping”; or
                    hold their mail in the consular section until they get around to picking it up;
                    or arrange for them to be invited to the Ambassador's garden party. Those
                    “extras” have long gone out the window. The American Consular Service today
                    provides the American public with direct assistance when they are in serious
                    need- - and when no other source of assistance is available on the spot. Heroic
                    lengths are often gone to in order to provide the citizen with adequate
                    protection. Think of the work in which we have both been involved over the
                    years: the Jonestown suicides, various airplane tragedies, the drug arrests -
                    and overdoses; horrible automobile accidents, heart-rendering suicides,
                    abandoned families, orphaned children, tragic deaths. Most of the citizens we
                    have aided in such circumstances are most grateful at the moment for our
                    invaluable services - - and then never want to hear our name again. This is
                    natural, of course, as we remind them of a very black chapter of their
                    lives.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>A second major change in Consular Services is the inclusion of all officers in
                    formulating solutions to meet an extraordinary situation. As I mentioned
                    earlier, in 1962 no one in the Embassy ever asked my opinion or advice about any
                    subject whatsoever. It is perhaps symptomatic of the evolution of American
                    society that in today's normal Embassy - while there is still a sense of decorum
                    and order in the ranks - all officers are more likely to actively participate in
                    the work-life of the Mission rather than carry out a function with unquestioning
                    obedience. In addition, today all Embassy officers participate in “Consular
                    Duty” - that is, being available in off-duty hours in order to provide
                    assistance in emergency situations. Formerly only consular officers participated
                    in such work; today it is a given at any Mission that all officers - even from
                    AID or USIS - share the extra work involved.</p>
                <p>Embassy Paris - in 1962 - 1963 - was one enormous bureaucracy which had been
                    added to constantly since the end of World War II. Every agency of our
                    government was represented: from the Agriculture Department - - to the Federal
                    Bureau of Investigation. My professional life at the time was confined to the
                    Consular Section - providing assistance to Americans in difficulty; serving as
                    Consular Officer duty officer - - and also, by the way, having a wonderful time
                    as a bachelor in the city of Paris!! Only once in my entire tour did I attend
                    Ambassador Charles (Chip) Bohlen's weekly staff meeting. I recall sitting
                    against the wall - far from the Ambassador - wondering who half of the attendees
                    were! In those days, it was considered rather an innovation to invite at least
                    one - and sometimes two - junior officers to such a “high power” staff meeting.
                    I guess the purpose was so that we could observe “first hand” how Embassy policy
                    was formulated! In any event - I recall being appropriately impressed by this
                    gathering of these wise men (signs of the times - not a woman was present out of
                    a group of about 30 people). I also recall almost choking on the cigarette and
                    cigar smoke which filled the Ambassador's conference room! Needless to day - I
                    was not invited to say a word - and, of course, would not have dared offer an
                    unsolicited comment! It simply was not done in the early ''60s. How times have
                    changed !!</p>
                <p>To return to your question, Bill: it is obvious that today's U.S. diplomatic
                    Mission is smaller in size than those we knew at the beginning of our careers.
                    Over the years, our national financial constraints have dictated a major
                    reduction - - but, I believe that even if funding was not a constraint, our
                    embassies in post World War II in Europe were far too large. We often
                    overpowered host nations with the sheer size of our official presence in their
                    country. I saw this in country after country. The most shocking example - at
                    least to my mind - was our Embassy in Havana, Cuba. The chancery is a seven
                    story building dominating the city and the ambassadorial residence is almost on
                    a par in opulence with the White House. I am convinced that a smaller Mission
                    allows all officers to fully participate in the work of their own Sections - -
                    and also to learn what is going on in the rest of the Embassy. This kind of a
                    situation offers the individual officer more responsibility - and a greater
                    opportunity to expand his/her knowledge of the various Foreign Service
                    functions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also some modern devices have come to help some of
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly, Bill. The major improvement, of course, is in the field of
                    communications. A United States embassy no longer sends Dispatches or Airgrams
                    or Operation Memorandums (OMs) - all those antiquated means of communication
                    which were sent to Washington via Diplomatic Pouch.....with replies returned
                    months later! I do believe that most posts retain, however the One Time Pad as
                    it is reputed to be the most secure means of cryptographic communication in
                    times of emergency. I recall having slaved over the OTPs for hours in Cordoba,
                    Argentina. This was our sole means of secure communications with either Buenos
                    Aires or Washington. Such antiquated forms of communication were not in evidence
                    in Paris, however - - although they might have had them stacked up in the
                    classified communication areas!! In the Paris Embassy, we had a central Embassy
                    File Room, and a copy was kept of every written communication that went out to
                    Washington or to any other post in the world. This was an enormous bureaucratic
                    process which no longer exists. Today, of course, everything is
                    computerized.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Paris, Bill I would like to comment on one aspect of the Mission
                    which I feel was unique and which - in all large Missions today - I believe is
                    lost forever. I am speaking of the Personnel Office - - and especially two
                    Personnel Officers: Shirley Green Fine and Eileen Kerley. At a large Embassy
                    like Paris, new arrivals experience great difficulty getting settled after
                    arrival. I well recall how much time and effort I personally expended in
                    assisting three young newly arrived secretaries who were staying in my hotel
                    after arrival at post. I was in the hotel for about a month before finding
                    affordable lodgings - - but these young women, none of whom spoke a word of
                    French - spent many months in the hotel. I know that they were initially very
                    homesick and often cried themselves to sleep at night. None had ever been abroad
                    before and so I felt obliged to do what I could to assist them. But my resources
                    - and wallet at the time - were both limited. The Personnel Officers at the
                    Embassy, however, went out of their way to make newly arrived personnel feel at
                    home. I am sure their kindness towards newcomers was nowhere found in their
                    official “job description” - but these officers arranged evening get -together
                    for all the new arrivals; they set up luncheons with other young people at the
                    post; new arrivals were often called on weekends to see if they were in need of
                    anything or invited for an impromptu evening supper. Everything possible was
                    done to assist them find housing. In short - - the Personnel Officers at the
                    Embassy did what today's Family Liaison Office is supposed to do - - with the
                    exception that they had a full time job on their hands. I shall never forget
                    their assistance and kindness to me!</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>While we have taken a short break from this chronological history, Bill, I would
                    also like to add a few comments on modern communications. Just take this project
                    you are engaged in - for example - Diplomatic Oral History. Can you imagine how
                    much our national history has been lost over the decades simply because this
                    history was never recorded? I really admire and encourage you and Stu Kennedy in
                    your Georgetown University project - - as it is most necessary and will, no
                    doubt, be of great value to future historians. It is not, of course, what we
                    record individually but what the historians eventually piece together from the
                    bits and pieces they gather from a reading of several such reports. We all know
                    full well that when a cable or report is sent to Washington from a post in the
                    field, the text is never the “full story” of the subject involved. It is tainted
                    not only by the author's own cultural, educational and social baggage ....but
                    often such reports are geared to elicit a hoped for reply. Operational reports
                    of whatever nature are often falsified, exaggerated or just incomplete.
                    Intelligence dribbles away as it moves up the chain of command! Some reports
                    from the field, as we know Bill, are written to please the recipient!! I'll bet
                    even Marco Polo's reports from China to the Doge back in Venice were written
                    “with an aim to please the Master and to tell him what he wanted to hear.” As
                    proof of this - we have only to take a close look at the tone - and often the
                    content - of cables sent directly to the White House or to SecState - and often
                    marked EYES ONLY!!</p>
                <p>How often have you really been “debriefed”, Bill, upon returning to the
                    Department from years spent abroad?I am sure you'll agree that no one in the
                    State Department ever has the patience or the time to speak at length about
                    political, social or cultural happenings in foreign lands - which took place
                    last year.. Besides, their IN BOXES are always overflowing!! The desk-bound
                    State officers have more to do than to listen to officers passing through
                    Washington. I 'll admit that I too felt the same way when I was assigned to
                    Washington - - and was obliged to receive officers fresh from the fields for
                    “debriefings”. I'll wager the same holds true for officers returning to
                    Whitehall and at the Quai d'Orsay! In my 32 years of service, the only valid
                    debriefing I participated in were conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency.
                    No one in State had the time to listen - unless there was some major crisis
                    involving either the Congress or - God forbid - the White House!! Following my
                    initial assignment to the Vatican in the mid-80s, I spent two full days at
                    Langley participating in some of the most interesting de-briefings imaginable.
                    The people with whom I spoke were intimately familiar with my reporting - and
                    knew all the characters about whom I reported. I spoke with experts from all
                    geographic areas of the world - - and I consider that the majority were true
                    experts in their fields. (What they did with all of their information I provided
                    is another matter! I haven't a clue!.) I was, however, most impressed with the
                    sessions - - and also personally gratified that someone else in the world felt
                    that the reports I had written - or had authorized - had some value and
                    contributed in some small way to the formulation of United States Foreign
                    Policy. (Perhaps this is a rather selfish way of looking at things - - but
                    doesn't everyone like a bit of job satisfaction!!)</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very true - and a good observation, Peter. To get
                        back to Paris: The Embassy bureaucracy was there, in your view, because of
                        what? The antiquated days in which we lived, or was there some reasoning
                        behind this extensive bureaucracy in protecting the individual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, I think that our government - as all governments - was hell-bent on
                    keeping records. Records are necessary for the good and benefit of the
                    individual citizens. The importance of maintaining accurate birth, death,
                    marriage, citizenship, passport matters, visa records is quite obvious in the
                    conduct of an orderly society.In the early '60 - while I was in Paris - I
                    experienced the cumbersome manner in which records were created and stored
                    during that era - and then sent on to the National Archives. Today - all that
                    has changed - as I am sure it will change again by the year 2,500.!Modern
                    communications - with the advent of computers, satellite communication,
                    Internet, e-mail, have all improved to such an extent that we are no longer
                    bound by mountains of paperwork. How much easier it all seems in today's
                    world.....except when your computer crashes!! In addition, Bill, the bureaucracy
                    was a remnant of the “war years” - when all governments in the Western World
                    directly controlled the destiny of its citizens. At time of war - it is logical
                    that government grow in size and in power - as individuals are incapable of
                    facing such a disaster alone. The key is to know when to downsize following a
                    national emergency! I think that the past twenty years for our nation has been a
                    period of “forced downsizing” not just in government but also in the private
                    sector. “Uncle Sam” must take a back seat during peacetime and allow the people
                    to have more say in their own lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after the Embassy in Paris..... What came next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: As I mentioned I met my wife in Paris. I made application to the Under
                    Secretary for Management - as one did in those days - for permission to marry a
                    “foreigner who may turn out to be a major security risk” - - and, at the same
                    time, submitted an official Letter of Resignation from the United States Foreign
                    Service - lest the security checks found that my then fiancee was not acceptable
                    to our government! From Paris I was assigned to the Embassy in Managua,
                    Nicaragua. I left Paris in October of 1994 to return to Washington, and
                    proceeded to study Spanish at the Foreign Service Institute for the next four
                    months. Armed with the approval of the Department of State to marry, I returned
                    to Paris. Jacqueline and I were married in March at the Mairie of the 16eme and,
                    subsequently, at the Eglise de Notre Dame de Grace de Passy. We never did make
                    it to Managua, Nicaragua however!</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>Following our marriage - and a few days in Barbizon - the beautiful artists
                    village near Fontainebleau - we left France for Estoril, Portugal. While on our
                    honeymoon in Estoril, I received a phone call from a close friend in the
                    Personnel office in Paris (Shirley Green) who informed me that my assignment had
                    been changed by the Department. (Can you imagine a thing like that being done
                    today, Bill!! Not a word to me - but just a change of orders issued and
                    dispatched to post!!) The “needs of the Service” - as we used to say - dictated
                    that my presence was needed in Cordoba rather than in Managua. “ Great” - said I
                    - “we can drive from here”.” She replied, “No, no, .....not Spain, but
                    Argentina. And it's not summer, it's soon going to be winter.” I hadn't a clue
                    where Cordoba was located in Argentina - - or indeed why we had a Consulate
                    there. But - orders were orders - and they were paying my salary!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jackie was learning about the Foreign Service early!.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. She really did learn early! But we were both young - and a
                    bit unconscious!</p>
                <p>So back we went to Boston, my hometown, to visit with the family for a few days.
                    From there we went to Washington - - to have Jackie naturalized - which was also
                    required in those days. (A spouse was not given a choice. All foreign-born
                    spouses were obliged to become American citizens as soon after marriage as
                    feasible.) In addition, an exception had been granted by the Department to allow
                    me to go on to another foreign post. Normally, officers with foreign spouses
                    were required to spend at least the first two years following marriage in
                    Washington in order for the spouse to become “Americanized”. As Jackie had lived
                    nine years in Texas in her youth, the Under Secretary of Management (Crockett,
                    at that time) decided that additional residence in the United States was
                    unnecessary. Thus, we flew from Washington to Caracas - where we visited friends
                    of Jackie's parents and an old school chum of mine who was then an exchange
                    professor at the University of Caracas.</p>
                <p>Following a week of briefings at the Embassy in Buenos Aires, we finally arrived
                    in Cordoba - - our home for the next two years. And....what an exciting two
                    years it turned out to be !!!</p>
                <p>It started off with a bang! Right at the Cordoba airport before we deplaned. (By
                    the way, I am glad you have assured me, Bill, that this history will not be
                    available to the general public for at least 50 years - - because I could
                    perhaps be taken to court for some of my revelations!!)</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I should describe our arrival in Cordoba, because of its unusual nature. Very few
                    of our Foreign Service colleagues had ever been to Cordoba, Argentina. It is a
                    lovely city of 800,000 people - and the second or third in size in the nation -
                    depending if you are speaking to a native of Cordoba or Rosario!! More than half
                    the city's population is of Italian origin. The Consulate was very small - a two
                    man post with two national employees.The main reason for the Consulate's
                    presence in the city was the presence of the Argentine Military Schools in the
                    Province of Cordoba. The city and that area was politically important; it was
                    there that the revolution to overthrow Juan Peron had been hatched by the
                    military. Cordoba was the only consulate in the Republic and the consular
                    district was almost as large as one-fourth the territory of the United States.
                    In the late 19th century, the United States had a consulate in Rosario and also
                    one in Cordoba - - but both had had been closed years before my arrival in the
                    country. I never did discover just when the old consulates closed. The Consulate
                    in which I worked had only been opened during the presidency of Juan Peron. I
                    recall a fellow coming to my office one day and presenting me with the two lead
                    seals of the old American Consulate in Cordoba. His great-grandfather, so he
                    claimed, had been entrusted with the seals of office at the time of the closing.
                    I sent the material off to the Historical Office of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:What is the reason for these small Consulates, Peter. Was
                        the one in Cordoba really established because of Argentine military schools?
                        What was it you were doing? Political listening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY. Political listening - - yes. In effect we were sort of a listening post
                    far from the hub of things - in Buenos Aires. I believe that there was a valid
                    reason for the post: the Argentine military - as the military of most Latin
                    American nations - were a powerful force in the life of the nation. It is good
                    for our country to know these leaders - and, if possible, to acquaint them with
                    our ideals and interests. My work at the post, however, consisted mainly of
                    Administration, Consular, Commercial - with some Political reporting thrown in.
                    We did come to know many Argentine military leaders over the period of our
                    Argentine tour of duty. There was no way to avoid this: they were the leaders of
                    the society and you met them at every function you attended!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The American presence was minimal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: In reality - the American presence in that part of Argentina was very
                    little. We had a few Roman Catholic and Mormon missionaries. The only US
                    business related enterprise was a Kaiser automobile plant. Kaiser automobiles
                    were produced there and I'd say there were about 30 American businessmen and
                    their families connected with the company in residence in Cordoba. It was a very
                    small post - as I mentioned. My boss, the Consul, was a fellow named Temple
                    Wanamaker...no relative of the Philadelphia Wanamakers, he used to say!.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Let me continue with my description of our initial arrival at post, Bill. This is
                    really too good a story not to record for posterity as well as a fine
                    illustration of the situations young officers sometimes face in living and
                    working abroad. After our long journey from Paris - to Portugal - Boston -
                    Washington - Caracas - Buenos Aires.....Jackie and I finally boarded a small
                    plane in Buenos Aires bound for Cordoba. The Cordoba airport, in those days (and
                    perhaps even today!) consisted of a dirt runway - with a small building which
                    served as the Airport Terminal. A brilliant sun was setting as we taxied up to
                    the terminal. Looking out the small window, I noticed a jeep parked on the
                    tarmac. In the setting sun, I saw a rather plump woman leaning against the jeep.
                    I commented to my wife, “My God, look at the way the natives dress.” The woman
                    in question had long, blond hair sporting a small orchid, and was smoking a
                    cigarette in a long cigarette holder. Best of all, she was dressed in a flowing
                    muumuu. As she was against the setting sun, it was perfectly obvious she had
                    nothing on under her muumuu. You guessed it, Bill - - she turned out to be my
                    Boss' wife. After welcoming us she said , “Oh, you certainly can't go to a
                    hotel. You have to come and stay with us until you find a place of your own.. We
                    have a large home.” What could we do - - but accept! She drove directly to their
                    spacious home and, on the way, remarked, “Unfortunately, my husband is quite
                    busy today; he's in the process of completing hiFederal Income Taxes and won't
                    be able to join us until dinner time — - about 11:00 PM.” It was perhaps 7:00 PM
                    at that point. “He'll join us for dinner.” I though to myself. “My God, there
                    are only two of us at this post, and he can't find the time to come out to say
                    Hello”. I thought this a rather inauspicious beginning of anew tour of duty!
                    Sophie Wanamaker added, “Please do join us in the pool as it is so hot.” We went
                    up to our room. I glanced out the window and saw a magnificent swimming pool. I
                    then got the shock of my life: there were about eight people sitting around the
                    pool - all stark naked! It was at that point that I discovered that my new boss
                    and his family were nudists! There is nothing wrong with being a nudists but -
                    at that point in our lives - as a newly married couple in the mid-60s - the
                    revelation came as rather a shock. My wife and I quickly changed plans - and
                    rested in our room until the dinner hour!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it that they did clothe themselves eventually.....
                        in Cordoba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes indeed ! As you can well imagine, we did find a huge difference in
                    life in Cordoba - and at the Consulate - from the previous experience in Paris.
                    It began with the physical setting of the Consulate - - located on the seventh
                    story of a twelve-story commercial building in downtown Cordoba. It was the
                    highest building in the town. The one unfortunate thing about the Consulate was
                    that we could count on having electricity only about two or three days each
                    week. Thus - you took your life in your if you took the elevator up to the
                    office!. After getting stuck for hours one day - I never entered the elevator
                    again! The population of the city of Cordoba was about 800,000 as I mentioned -
                    and over half the residents were of Italian origin. Thus - the Spanish spoken
                    there turned out to have a very peculiar accent - with Italian words also thrown
                    in from time to time. We enjoyed the people very much and quickly made friends
                    throughout the community. Many of these people remain close friends to this day
                    - and have come to visit us in the United States and at other posts
                    overseas.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italian served you well later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. Now .....for the work of the Consulate. As I mentioned earlier,
                    the scope of the work was mainly political reporting but we did do some consular
                    work as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give us a sample of the kinds of work you did, Peter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: My assignment was as Admin/Consular Officer. As such, I was responsible
                    for all of the administrative work of the consulate; the communications work
                    (including classified communication by means of the one-time Pad - which just
                    about drove me crazy!!); plus the consular operation. In addition, I also did
                    reporting on some economic and commercial matters in the area - in addition to
                    political reports, from time to time. I was also responsible for overseeing the
                    AID work in the consular district. (Alianza para el Progreso - as it was known
                    in those years.) This was my initial assignment; .....two months after arrival
                    in Cordoba, everything changed with the shooting of my boss, Temple
                    Wanamaker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's put some dates on this period again, Peter. You were
                        there what period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Let's see, we arrived in March 1965 and we left Cordoba in the fall of
                    1967. Prior to leaving Cordoba, I actually closed the post - and a Consular
                    Agent was appointed by the Department. This event was, in effect, the aftermath
                    of the shooting of my boss which, as I've noted, occurred a couple of months
                    following our arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the gentleman who was so busy doing his
                        taxes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. Temple Wanamaker was attacked returning from work in the
                    one government car at the post. That afternoon, I was taking a Spanish lesson at
                    a nearby seminary. Normally, I would have been with him in the auto as we lived
                    in the same neighborhood and drove to work together each day. The police
                    interrupted my lesson to tell me that my boss had been shot. There were eighteen
                    bullets in the consular station wagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fatally shot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, following a month of hospitalization in Cordoba, he was taken back to
                    Washington by US Military aircraft for a long stay in the Walter Reed Hospital.
                    He eventually recovered from the three gunshot wounds - to his neck and
                    cheek.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the end of his career, I take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: He actually returned to work three years after the shooting and served as
                    a USIS officer in Costa Rica.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the cause of this attempt to kill the man? Was
                        this aimed at him? At the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Bill - this was a very unusual occurrence in those days in Latin America.
                    Never before in history had an American diplomat been attacked in the area. This
                    was the first time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: At the time of the shooting, some sheets of anti-U.S. propaganda were
                    discovered - - condemning the intervention of the United States Marines in the
                    Dominican Republic. You'll recall that President Lyndon Johnson had sent US
                    Marines to Santo Domingo in 1965 in order to “restore order”. The shooting in
                    Cordoba was thus supposedly in retaliation...... at least that's how it was put
                    to me by our security people at the Embassy in Buenos Aires and the Argentine
                    government. In the aftermath of the attack, the Argentine Federal and local
                    police rounded up over 600 “suspects”. I was instructed by the Department of
                    State to attend some of these interrogations. Never in my life could I have
                    imagined such brutal interrogation. Electric shocks were applied to the genitals
                    of the suspects. They were interrogated following beatings with tin cans on
                    their heads. At one point, I told the Colonel conducting the interrogations that
                    I would confess to the shooting if they tried the same tactics on me! I watched
                    this travesty for a portion of two days....to satisfy Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed on as sort of the Charg�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I stayed on alone as the only American officer at the post - - until the
                    Embassy sent a TDY officer (Calvin Berlin) to assist weeks later. An officer
                    from “another agency” also arrived after the shooting. We were pretty much on
                    our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We this at this point, let's pause a moment, Peter,
                        because of Burundi and Kigali, etc., going on now, how important our
                        security it, and how troops come to defend us etc. What was the security
                        that you had?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>MURPHY: It's very interesting that you mention that. There was no security at
                    that time. The Consulate itself, its premises, was a suite of maybe four or five
                    offices with a large waiting area for the public. We had two local/national
                    employees. One of them was the nephew of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
                    in Argentina. Of course he (Belindo Martinez Gavier) had been hired by the
                    Consulate at the time because of his family connections. He was absolutely
                    useless as a national employee. I found him one day attempting to have an
                    Argentine fill out a U. S. passport application for a visa. He never did learn
                    the difference between a U. S. passport and a U. S. visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had connections?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Connections he did have! He didn't last very long because he'd go home
                    for lunch - followed by a two hour siesta - and return to the office a half hour
                    before we closed for the day. Poor Belindo simply couldn't understand why we
                    insisted on eight hours a day. It was beyond him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You told him about the taxes that your former boss was
                        paying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY:Ha ! But security...... you asked about the security, Bill. We had none at
                    all in the Consulate. We simply locked the front door when we left at night. The
                    windows were all just plain glass, nothing special - no bulletproof materials!
                    The official vehicle we used there - the one which was shot up - was a large
                    Chevy station wagon. You can't imagine how much it stuck out in the town. It was
                    the only American stations wagon for hundreds of miles around Everyone knew who
                    was driving that car!.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It had flags on it?</hi>

                <p>MURPHY: No, no, we didn't need any flags. Cars in those days were precious
                    commodities in Argentina. If anyone had a car, they were considered very, very
                    wealthy because of the taxes that had to be paid to the government when
                    purchasing a car. To give you an example, Bill - - prior to going to Argentina,
                    we were told by the post, “Oh you don't need a car. There's an official car
                    here. You don't need a private car at all.” Well, that was a lot of hogwash as
                    far as I was concerned. We got there and we found we had to live twenty miles
                    from downtown. You couldn't get anywhere without a car - — and there was one a
                    official vehicle at post. You can just guess who used that!</p>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. I mentioned the Kaiser factory in Cordoba. This was the
                    largest American institution or business in our consular district. So.... I
                    wrote my father ( in those days you never telephoned for such business) and
                    asked him to buy me a second-hand car. He bought a Rambler (made by Kaiser) for
                    $300. Our car arrived in Cordoba about three months later. The day after its
                    arrival , I was offered $26,000 for the car at a local gas station! I know that
                    this sounds unbelievable but there were absurd Argentine taxes on all cars
                    coming into the country. So high - in fact - that you could have bought five
                    cars at a normal price in the US for the price on one in Argentina. Of course,
                    it was for this reason that ruling was put into effect by State regulating the
                    sale of cars abroad by diplomats.</p>
                <p>In any event, following the shooting, the Argentines certainly beefed up security
                    around our house. We had a very small house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beefed it up from zero?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: From zero..... we had nothing before. For the rest of our tour (almost
                    two years) we lived with Argentine military guards sitting in our front garden
                    manning machine guns. These people were quite dangerous. They were mostly
                    Indians who spoke no Spanish. They were normally drunk, and they chewed cocoa
                    beans all day long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To keep?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: To give themselves a high; they were usually kind of “spaced out” during
                    their duty hours.</p>
                <p>MURPHY: As I would wander around the town going about my business, every so often
                    I would have plain clothes people..... kind of hippie-like cops..... come up,
                    grab me by the arm, and say, “Don't worry, we're here to protect you.” This
                    would almost produce cardiac arrest on the spot - as you can imagine, Bill!</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Before we leave, I absolutely must mention one other incident connected
                    with this “shooting” of Temple Wanamaker. As you can well understand, Bill, my
                    wife and I spent almost two years in Cordoba - living in fear for our lives; we
                    constantly thought we might be the object of another “terrorist attack”. I am
                    convinced that that, as a result of this fear, Jackie had two miscarriages
                    during our first two years of married life. As we prepared to leave Cordoba for
                    re-assignment - I at last began to get a glimmer of the duplicity - as well as
                    inhumanity - of the government of the United States of America! It began this
                    way: The State Department sent me a glossy photo of Temple Wanamaker at a State
                    Department ceremony accepting a Superior Honor Award - from the Secretary of
                    State himself. The award was made, said the caption accompanying the photo - -
                    for his courage in the attack he underwent during his service in Cordoba,
                    Argentina. I was asked to publish this photo and accompanying article in the
                    local press - which, of course, I did. About a week later, the Cordoba city
                    government officials hosted a farewell party in our honor. As usual, all the
                    local and regional leaders were present. One friend who attended was the Jesuit
                    Rector of the Universidad de Cordoba - one of the oldest universities in the
                    Western Hemisphere. This gentleman was Belgian - a relative of the King of
                    Belgium. We got along well during the two years I was there and he provided me
                    with a good insight into higher education in the area. As the reception drew to
                    a close, the Jesuit came up to me and said “I read in the paper last week about
                    that ceremony for Wanamaker in Washington” Laughingly, he added, “You people
                    give awards for all sorts of activity, don't you!” He emphasized the words “all
                    sorts . From that instant, I began to understand that there was something
                    strange about the “terrorist shooting” of Temple Wanamaker - - but I wouldn't
                    know the truth until I visited the Security Division at the State Department in
                    Washington a month later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got an award for getting shot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: For getting shot.... and for his courage in the face of adversity -
                    supposedly. I shall never forget the face of my Jesuit friend at that reception
                    - he sort of smiled knowingly and walked away. Upon my return to Washington for
                    “consultations” before going on Home Leave and entering Italian language
                    training for preparation for my next post (Milan, Italy), I visited the Security
                    Division of the Department . I asked for a full explanation of the Cordoba
                    shooting. In a very matter of fact manner, I was told - “It was obvious why the
                    guy was shot! He was fooling around with the very young daughter of a local
                    military commander. This happened before your arrival at post.” When I recovered
                    from the shock, I asked why I was not told - and why they asked me to
                    participate in such a cover up by the placing of the photo in the local press. I
                    was told that it was in the “national interest” and the decision was certainly
                    not that of DS.Little did they care that my wife and I lived in constant fear of
                    our lives for two years. Looking back - all I can say is “ it's a good thing
                    that we were young!!”</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right....that and also having to live two years of our lives in
                    fear. I was so embarrassed after having spoken to my Jesuit friend. I
                    immediately realized that there were people in that room who knew a lot more
                    than I did about the situation - although I was the chief United States
                    government representative in that area of the world for over eight months. I
                    even attended the “interrogation” of suspects - at the direction of the State
                    Department. Q: Why do you think those reasons were given - - by the Argentine,
                    we can understand - - but why by our own government? Couldn't we have just said,
                    “We don't know?”</p>
                <p>MURPHY: I have no idea. I have no idea why the cover-up was made. I'm sure it was
                    made at a high level in Washington; by someone not wishing to admit that human
                    error had been made by a U. S. official. Let's hope, Bill, that the “national
                    security interest” justified the situation into which we were forced!!</p>

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>MURPHY: I should make mention of Evita Peron before ending my tale of our days in
                    Argentina. I, of course, was quite familiar with the history of Juan and Eva
                    Peron but never fully realized her impact on the nation until I arrived in
                    Cordoba. She was a frequent subject of conversation. You really couldn't forget
                    about her - because each day, at the very moment of her death, the radio
                    stations observed a moment of silence “because this was the moment when Evita
                    passed into eternity”. Strange as it may seem, years later, in Milan, I was to
                    run across Eva Peron once again! I was friendly with a young undertaker - Mario
                    Cal - who had an funeral establishment in Milan which we often used when the
                    need arose at the Consulate General in that city. Mario, as his family name
                    indicates, was from Venice. He and his wife became very friendly with Jackie and
                    me. One evening at dinner he told me that he was going on a long trip the next
                    day - and that I would read all about it in the local press. He adamantly
                    refused to tell us (even his wife!) his destination. Imagine our shock to read
                    the next day that he had escorted the remains of Eva Peron from the Monumental
                    Cemetery in Milan to the residence of her husband - Juan Peron - in Madrid where
                    she was interred once again! Eva Person had been buried under a false name in
                    the Milan cemetery for years - due to anti-Peron sentiments in Argentina at the
                    time. The Italian government was very upset that a foreigner had been interred
                    in Italy under false pretenses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an order
                    to all diplomatic establishments in the country instructing that a consul be
                    present - for identification purposes- before a coffin of one of their citizen's
                    could be sealed. I found this to be a most disagreeable task - and often teased
                    Mario that it was all his fault!</p>
                <p>MURPHY: I believe so. When we left the post, I closed up shop. The post has
                    remained closed since that day. A Consular Agent was named; he was a retired
                    American businessman who, unfortunately, was killed by a bullet in the streets
                    of Cordoba six months later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The consulate was closed for the good of the American

                <p>MURPHY: For the good of the American taxpayer. Bill ....I must record here that,
                    in spite of everything, my wife and I really did enjoy living in Argentina.
                    Friends, as you well know, make a place. We still have some very wonderful
                    Argentine people who are lifelong friends. We remain in contact today. I hope
                    someday to return to Cordoba and visit the spots which brought joy to our
                    youth!!</p>
                <p>Now, to go on. We enjoyed our normal Home Leave....showing off proudly our
                    first-born - Paul Robert Murphy, born August 16, 1966 in Cordoba, Argentina.
                    Jackie and Paul left for Paris to visit with her family while I stayed in
                    Washington to see if the FSI could help me learn a little Italian for my Milan
                    assignment. In spite of the ordeal of returning to the FSI in Rosslyn, I must
                    admit that they did a wonderful job in only 8 weeks of putting Spanish out of my
                    mind - substituting Italian. Following the two month course, I flew to Paris to
                    join my family.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, no, to visit with my wife's parents. I then left Paris (August 1967)
                    for Milan to begin my new assignment and to look for a place to live.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it looked like your career was going to be doing more
                        consular work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It looked that way. I was assigned as number two officer in a rather
                    large Consular Section at the Consulate General in Milan. Our consular district
                    covered most of Northern Italy - including the former Venice consular district
                    and the provinces north of Venice. It was a tourist-filled area - with a large
                    sprinkling of American businessmen living in the Milan-Como area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this something you were happy about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I was delighted. I always wanted to get to know Italy; I believe all
                    Americans feel a great affinity for Italy - and for Italians in general. It is
                    almost like a second country for many Americans. With over 26 million
                    Italo-Americans in the USA - who can wonder!!Also, my work in Argentina was more
                    Administrative and Political in content - with very little consular work. I was
                    eager to get to know consular work better. I guess the main reason was that I
                    like people - and like to be with them, talk with them - and, if they are in
                    difficulty, help them out! (This sounds like a good mix for a consular officer,
                    don't you think?) I was interested to work in a medium-sized consular section,
                    as opposed to a place like Paris where you were stuck doing the same job for a
                    two year tour. (This was, Bill, before “rotational assignments”.).</p>
                <p>In any event..... my work there in Italy. Let me described a bit the Consulate in
                    Milan . Q: Maybe in terms of what it was like in Paris, to give the reader sort
                    of a comparison of the two posts?</p>
                <p>MURPHY: Sure......I couldn't even wager a guess how many officers there were in
                    the entire Embassy in Paris when I was there in 1962. But, as I noted
                    previously, we had a total of 18 officers in the consular section alone.</p>
                <p>In Milan we had a total of 21 officers in the entire Consulate General. The
                    consular section was an important element of the post because of the numbers of
                    Americans in and around Milan and also the US-NATO bases in the area at Aviano
                    and Vicenza. The city of Milan, as you are aware, is the financial and business
                    capital of the Italian Republic. In addition to the Consulate General proper, we
                    had a large USIA operation and a permanent Trade Fair at the Milan Fair Grounds
                    - which was operated by the Department of Commerce. Not a month went by when
                    there was not an international show of some sector of business - and always a
                    large American contingent present.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that number was the total American...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I'd say about 18 American officers and staff members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...including foreign service nationals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, just the Americans.</p>
                <p>In the consular section itself, we had eighteen Italians and five officers. I was
                    the number two officer. My boss at that time was a fellow named Charlie Selak. I
                    don't know if you've ever run into Charlie. He was originally a Political
                    Officer. Charlie who took a consular assignment to Italy as he always dreamed of
                    living in Italy. He was, by inclination and education, a rather good historian.
                    Charlie was certainly not a consular officer. He disliked intensely having to
                    deal with the public - American or Italian! This caused innumerable problems, as
                    you can well imagine!. He told me the only reason he accepted the consular
                    assignment to Milan was because of the location of the city - and the fact that
                    he was able to live in Italy!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he been at all...the experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: He had very little consular experience, but as he wanted to come back to
                    Italy, he somehow arranged the Milan assignment. He retired in Milan - having no
                    family back in the United States. Years later I learned he was seriously ill and
                    is presently living in Sri Lanka - being taken care of by faithful servants who
                    were with him in Milan - but came originally from Colombo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: A reward, yes....I suppose. His assignment most unsuccessful. Charlie was
                    a very nice person - and quite knowledgeable. He is a very shy person, and did
                    not like speaking with the public. We had a cross-section of applicants... visa
                    applicants ...in that post. Many Iranians who resided in Milan, many Third World
                    nationals. The Italians we had were usually visitors to the United States We did
                    not issue immigrant visas; at that time they were issued in Genoa. But I must
                    say that the business of non-immigrant visas was booming, absolutely booming. We
                    had at least ten locals, Italian nationals, working on visas.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: The dates that I was assigned to Milan: 1967 until 1972.</p>
                <p>The Consulate in Venice had recently closed, so we had jurisdiction over Venice
                    and that area of Italy. It was very nice for me, because during the busy summer
                    tourist months, I went twice a week to Venice and took care of consular matters
                    in Venice ... of which there were many.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mostly American services oriented?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: American services oriented, or deaths, or hospitalizations. There was a
                    mental hospital on one of the islands in the port and we always seemed to have
                    Americans in residence. In addition, I visited the local jails, hospitals - and
                    looked in on the various “Junior Year Abroad” headquarters of several large
                    American universities. In those days, there was considerable open drug abuse - -
                    so, I had my hands full.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But no visa work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, we did not issue visas in Venice. There was, however, lots of welfare
                    work. I recall that there was an American Anglican priest, - who had studied in
                    England and was ordained in the Church of England - and who was very kind in
                    helping us out from time to time. He resided in Venice (Victor ??) I remember
                    that he had a very British accent and lived in very comfortable quarters right
                    in the center of Venice. Victor was almost like someone out of a novel. I would
                    leave him money from our small Welfare Fund - and if I couldn't make it to
                    Venice, he would assist American citizens with real emergencies by lending money
                    - or visiting the sick. I used to encourage him - telling him it was a great
                    opportunity for practicing the Corporal Works of Mercy! (In effect - that is
                    kind of what Overseas Citizen Services work is all about, isn't it, Bill!) The
                    Venice Fire Department kept our motor boat for us. We were fortunate in having
                    motor boat which had belonged to the old Consulate in Venice. Whenever I visited
                    the city, I had great transportation. A fireman would meet me at the steps of
                    the train station.....and off we'd go - down the Canale Grande!</p>
                <p>The building itself, the Consulate building, which was on the Grand Canal - just
                    next to Peggy Guggenheim's museum - was let by our Embassy in Rome for $1 a year
                    to Wake Forest University. This school was the alma mater of Graham Martin, who
                    was Ambassador in Rome at that time. That situation lasted for about a year,
                    until one day I was passing this building and saw smoke pouring from the library
                    window. Upon investigating, I found a group of students bombed out of their mind
                    on drugs. They built a fire in the middle of the floor of the library.</p>

                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Very high !</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stop here. Maybe Venice is a very good point to tell
                        the reader more about the kinds of assistance that you give to destitute
                        Americans, or troubled Americans, or “drugged Americans.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I'll try to explain what we were doing. I always found it a bit difficult
                    doing work long distance - from Milan to Venice. When you are far from your
                    office - you don't have the assistance, phones, secretaries, communications with
                    Washington, etc. You are forced to become inventive as well as ingenious. We not
                    only helped Americans who were ill - by arranging for medical assistance and
                    visiting them in the hospital. We also spent a lot of time visiting prisoners in
                    Venice. We spent much time with lawyers and in the city jails ...and at several
                    police stations around the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Visiting druggies mostly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Mostly drug related cases - yes. And helping them with their legal
                    representation, engaging attorneys. I also had several death cases in
                    Venice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Death in Venice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - Bill - Death in Venice. But I began to think it was mostly “Suicide
                    in Venice”. I had a number of rather complicated suicides in Venice. And some
                    were very messy suicides. And of course, we secure the estate for the relatives,
                    and dispatch the bodies back home.</p>
                <p>But, in addition, we also did commercial work.....a lot of it, in fact! We would
                    look into commercial complaints. I'll never forget one day Bloomingdales of New
                    York, ordered XXX number - a rather large quantity - of hand -blown glass
                    figurines to be sold in Bloomingdales. Now - - these glass figures were all of
                    Jewish characters. They were rabbis, cantors and representatives of typical
                    Jewish characters living within the ghetto in Venice in the Middle Ages. There
                    still exists a rather large ghetto in Venice - just near the main train station.
                    Located in the ghetto are two or three Jewish glassblowers who produced these
                    magnificent figurines. Many American companies believe these pieces of art are
                    mass produced. They figured they could receive - let's say 2000 of these glass
                    figurines - within a six month period. They complained to the Consulate when
                    they didn't get their order filled on time. So I'd go to see these artisans....
                    and they would - of course - simply laugh. They'd explain, “Look it takes me
                    nine hours to make one of these figures, and we just can't make 2000 in a short
                    period. We've tried to explain it to these customers in New York - -they'll just
                    have to wait.” We got involved in a lot of this type of commercial work
                    especially with the Murano glass works on the island off the coast.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Commercial. I was going to say, you might make that
                        distinction clear to the reader that the Commercial Section in an Embassy
                        doesn't normally handle commercial complaints. How did the other things vary
                        from what you were doing in Paris? Was it the same kind of thing that you
                        were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The work in Milan was much more varied - - as I was involved in
                    everything....all aspects of consular work. I mentioned the fact that Charlie
                    Selak had no real interest in consular work and disliked having to deal with the
                    public. Charlie retired a year after my arrival in Milan - and I was promoted to
                    his position - as Chief of the Consular Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were a lot of American businessmen in northern Italy
                        at the time, were there not? So you had financial people there, economic
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. They managed to keep our Section quite busy. For example,
                    in our Notarial Unit, we had about two national employees just to do the work
                    involved in notarizing documents, arranging for the taking of Court depositions,
                    legalizing documents for use by American and Italian Courts. Much of the work
                    was related to the enormous business interests which continues to exist between
                    the two nations.</p>
                <p>And then, we had, as I mentioned, a lot of Non-Immigrant Visa work, in addition
                    to considerable passport and citizenship work in connection with the American
                    business community and - above all - the presence of two large United States
                    Military Bases within the consular district. There were at least 10,000 American
                    residents of the city of Milan and surrounding areas. The Federal Benefits work
                    (Social Security, Veterans Benefits, Black Lung, Railway Retirement, etc.) was
                    also heavy - as was fraud within this area. Fraud investigations took a lot of
                    our time. Our district extended all the way from Milan over to Venice, and in
                    this area there is a lot of commerce. As we all know, the Italians are very
                    clever and artistic people and they produce beautiful products. From that area
                    of Italy the furniture, glasswork, china, silverware, firearms are all
                    exceptional.</p>
                <p>In addition, during my service in Milan we had several very difficult deaths of
                    American citizens - caused by accidents, suicides as well as natural causes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A lot of these were Italian-Americans perhaps, or people
                        with dual-citizenship?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Many were Italian-Americans. We had very complex situations involving
                    cremation - a process little known in Italy in those days (pre-Vatican II). The
                    cremations I was involved in were usually carried out in nearby Switzerland. I
                    recall one particular death case of - - lets call him Mr. Jones. He died of old
                    age in Venice where he and his wife owned a rather large Palazzo.One day Mrs.
                    Jones called to let me know that her husband Jim had died. She said, “Jim died
                    the way he would have wished to go. He was out in his gondola with their servant
                    Giovanni at the helm”. He simply had an acute heart attack. Mrs. Jones proceeded
                    to tell me she had contacted the local undertaker - who would be coming to see
                    me in Milan in the morning. Sure enough - at 9:00 AM in comes the undertaker -
                    who happened to be the one the Consulate usually used in the city of Venice.
                    Dressed entirely in black, and rubbing his hands together in that “Digger
                    O'Dell” sort of way, he proceeded to tell me that he feared that he was not able
                    to carry out Mrs. Jones' wishes in regard to her husband's final disposition. He
                    then informed me Mrs. Jones had asked him to have her husband cremated - and “
                    scatter his ashes over the Grand Canal in Venice.....the city he loved so much.”
                    You can imagine the reaction of my Italian staff to this particular situation !!
                    They were absolutely shocked to think of scattering human remains around the
                    city of Venice! I managed to convince Mrs. Jones that the Italian Ministry of
                    Health in Rome would never give permission for such a disposition of her
                    husbands ashes. With resignation, she accepted the reply - and informed me that
                    she would bring Jim's ashes to London - “because he was fond of that city,
                    too!!”</p>
                <p>We had many strange cases relating to the death of foreigners. For example, as
                    the result of the clandestine burial of Evita Peron under a false name in the
                    main Milan cemetery, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs directed that henceforth
                    all foreign corpses had to be personally identified by the deceased's consular
                    representative prior to burial or shipment to another country. From that day on,
                    once or twice a week, I would go to the local city morgue to identify my fellow
                    Americans - using the late citizen's passport photo as means of identification.
                    I was usually joined - early in the morning - by some of my foreign diplomatic
                    colleagues at the Milan City Morgue for the purpose of identifying corpses!! I
                    assure you it was a very unpleasant task!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, before you leave Milan.......... just in
                        comparison to Paris particularly. You saw in Paris an enormous bureaucracy,
                        a lot of closed doors, a lack of communication, and incredible detail to
                        sort of cover themselves, if you will.</hi>

                <p>MURPHY: The “old Foreign Service ways” were still alive when I was first assigned
                    to Milan - but after a few years - things did improve in a dramatic way. Upon
                    arrival in Milan, I found that the Consul General at post was treated as a God
                    by the staff. His staff meetings were most unpleasant; in effect, he used his
                    time to berate officers in front of their peers. As an example of his
                    “management style” I'll provide an example: when I arrived at the post, I found
                    a pile of three month's work of mail awaiting me. This had built up during the
                    three months I was in transit (Home Leave, FSI training). Each piece of mail was
                    opened - - and the stamps removed with scissors!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The mail was actually opened so it could be read, or was
                        read?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, I have no idea if it was read or not. I asked the Deputy Principal
                    Officer, Chuck Johnson, what was going on. I was told that the Consul General's
                    father-in-law in Switzerland was a stamp dealer. Thus, the Consul General took
                    the liberty of opening all the incoming mail and cutting of the stamps for his
                    father-in-law. Evidently the American staff was quite accepting of this fact -
                    or else they were so intimidated by Mr. Earl T. Crain that they said nothing. I
                    told Chuck that I objected to having anyone open my mail and that I intended to
                    raise the matter at the first public opportunity. I was strongly counseled not
                    to do this - for fear of reprisals. At my first staff meeting, with the Consul
                    General and with eighteen or twenty Americans in the room, I proceeded to tell
                    then what I had found on my arrival at Post. No one could believe I had the
                    nerve to mention this fact. The Consul General was beside himself; he disclaimed
                    all knowledge of the situation - - and directed the Administrative Officer to
                    “look into the matter”. I am happy to report that from that day not a piece of
                    private mail was opened at the Consulate General!! Q: We probably still have
                    prima donnas in America, people are people, but in those days they were...</p>

                <p>MURPHY: YeMilan is a smaller post. I learned a lot;, we enjoyed our life in
                    Milan, a place full of cultural amenities. The people at the post all worked
                    together very well; everyone helped each other out in difficult situations. You
                    know how it is in a small post. You become very friendly — we still remain
                    friendly with many of the officers assigned with us to Milan. As a matter of
                    fact, last night I had dinner with someone who served at the post with me.</p>
                <p>That was the time of, well let's see the interesting people at the post. Bradford
                    Bishop comes to mind. I don't know if you remember Brad Bishop.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The name I indeed remember. The man who disappeared after
                        the murder of his family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. He murdered his entire family while on assignment in
                    Washington following his posting in Milan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has never been found.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Very strange. Here we have a Foreign Service Officer, a Yale graduate,
                    very bright - - with excellent career prospects. He was an Economic Officer in
                    Milan. He had a wife and two children. He was the only son of a wealthy widowed
                    mother - who came to see them often in Italy. His children were a bit older than
                    ours but, on one occasion, we all went skiing together for a week in Bormio -
                    north of Milan, near Sondrio. Aside from being short tempered - and very
                    critical of his wife, who came from a “less fortunate” background than he, Brad
                    appeared to be a nice fellow. We were all shocked to hear of the tragic killing
                    of all his family members - including his mother - a few years later in
                    Washington.I recall inviting Annette and Brad to dinner, sometime towards the
                    end of our tour in Milan - together with another couple - the French Consul
                    General in Milan and his wife - Mr. et Mme. P. Amanrich. Strange as it may sound
                    - six or seven years later this French Consul General also murdered his entire
                    family! Following his Milan assignment, he was named Ambassador to the Holy See
                    by President Pompidou. I recall that he, too, was a very intelligent - and most
                    ambitious diplomatic officer. His wife, as I remember, was from a “good French
                    family from the 16eme Arr. in Paris” which had lost most of their money - and
                    she was thus forced to take a secretarial job - in the Quai d'Orsay. There she
                    met her future husband. He was overjoyed with his appointment to the Vatican. As
                    you are aware, Bill, this appointment is perhaps the most prestigious in the
                    French diplomatic service. However, the joy did not last that long in Rome! In
                    less than two years - immediately following the election of President Valery
                    Giscard d'Estaing - Amanrich was recalled to Paris. It was reported that he was
                    crushed after his relatively short tour at the Vatican. Following his return to
                    Paris, he “walked the halls” of the Quai d'Orsay for the next six months, during
                    which time he turned down ambassadorships to several nations that he considered
                    beneath him and his professional qualifications. After all, the ambassadorship
                    to the Holy See for a French diplomat is a top assignment. Amanrich's
                    predecessors were some of the most influential and noted men in France. After
                    more than six months without an assignment in Paris, ....one evening while
                    watching the TV news, Amanrich shot and killed his wife and children; went to an
                    apartment on an upper floor in the same Paris apartment building and shot his
                    mother-in-law. He then drove around the city all night and, in the early hours
                    of the morning, gave himself up to the police. A few weeks later, he hanged
                    himself in his prison cell.</p>
                <p>Although we cannot be absolutely certain that Brad Bishop killed his family, all
                    evidence points to the fact that it was he. It is an unbelievable coincidence
                    that we had these two couples to dinner together in Milan years before these
                    tragic events.</p>

                        you also were involved in the Vatican.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right, Bill. A strange coincidence indeed, wouldn't you say?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after Milan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Following Milan we returned once again to Paris - for three and a half
                    more years!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this unusual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I suppose it is. However, I bid on the Visa job which was open at the
                    Paris Embassy - and was assigned to it. I did know the DCM at the time - Perry
                    Culley - but he exerted no influence to bring about my reassignment to France.
                    It was indeed a very interesting period to be in Paris - during the great
                    student uprisings of the early ''70s. Many of the public student demonstrations
                    at the time were in protest of our Cuban policy - as well, of course, as our
                    involvement in Vietnam. Many of these large and vocal demonstrations greeted us
                    as we left work in the evening - and attempted to walk home through the Place de
                    la Concorde. At the same time, there was also the “Algerian question” which was
                    consuming the French - the national animosity against the pied noir living in
                    France as well as the many Algerians themselves - and the resulting bombs
                    plastiques which continually exploded in the streets of Paris. I remember
                    getting caught in one such demonstration one evening in the Latin Quarter - and
                    being chased by the police through the streets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What years were you there, Peter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: This was 1972 to 1975.. There was also great “unrest” also in the
                    consular world because of the fact that Vietnam fell during that period. France
                    was heavily involved because of its strong ties to Indochina. As a result, many
                    of the former south Vietnamese government officials came to France......although
                    their ultimate destination was the United States.</p>
                <p>In Paris, I worked with Alice Clement in the Visa Section. Remember Alice
                    Clement?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I do indeed, but the reader perhaps doesn't. She needs a

                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Alice Clement was a consular officer from the Washington, DC area. A very
                    distinguished woman from a socially-prominent Washington family, Alice was the
                    Chief of the Visa Section at that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things hadn't changed that much when you got back?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The staff was smaller - but the work was still there. The lines for
                    consular services of all types were never ending. We were cramped in our Visa
                    quarters - which, at the time, were located in the Hotel Talleyrand - a French
                    government building leased to our government. It was located at the corner of
                    the Place de la Concorde - across from the Jardins des Tuilleries. As you well
                    know, Bill, the building was not at all designed as an office building - but
                    rather a luxurious town house ( or, rather, palace!) for Talleyrand. It was most
                    impractical for the Visa Section - with the USIS offices being located on the
                    upper floors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't this the former headquarters of the German SS when
                        the Nazis occupied Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. That's the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With prisons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I never did go down to the basement to see the reputed Nazi interrogation
                    chambers and cells..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, I never did visit that area of the building. I heard of it often
                    enough from the Marines but never ventured down there. Alice was the head of the
                    Visa Section and I was the Deputy. I also had a “political hat” and this
                    centered around working closely with our Political Section regarding the “Peace
                    Talks” with the Vietnamese. As you recall, these talks took place in Paris.
                    You'll also remember, perhaps, the months the two delegations spent discussing
                    the shape of the conference table. - and similar important matters!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Kissinger there at this conference?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Henry Kissinger did eventually did show up for the final phases of the
                    negotiations. It was a very interesting period for me. It was also around the
                    time we began our secret talks with the People's Republic of China - prior to
                    Kissinger's secret visit to Beijing - via Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you involved? You mentioned you were assigned to
                        the Visa Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The question of visas was a central part of our government's initial
                    talks with the Chinese. You will recall that our first talks with the PRC
                    involved the exchange, first of Ping-Pong players - and subsequently of
                    personnel in the medical field. These exchanges naturally involved the issuance
                    of visas to the Chinese - and this was all arranged at our Embassy in Paris. Not
                    having any US diplomatic offices in the PRC, the Chinese participants were
                    obliged to visit our Embassy in Paris prior to travel to the United States. I
                    visited the Chinese Embassy on several occasions - and the Chinese diplomats, in
                    turn, came to see me at my office in the Hotel Talleyrand - just off the Place
                    de la Concorde. After three or four meetings regarding this subject, I was
                    joined by Ambassador Thomas Watson (our ambassador in Paris - of the IBM Watson
                    family) who would speak with the Chinese Ambassador while I discussed the
                    initial exchanges with my counterpart. Each visit to the Chinese Embassy was
                    very closely controlled by Washington. Watson did manage to get into difficulty
                    the first couple of times - because he drank too much of the Chinese wine - or
                    whatever it was that they insisted on offering to us!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would go as a representative of the Consular
                        Section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. These meetings were all held very closely. There wasn't a word in
                    the press at the time that the two countries were speaking. The direct result of
                    the talks was, of course, the eventual secret visit of the then Secretary of
                    State Kissinger to China (via Pakistan, I believe) to prepare the way for the
                    historic visit to the PRC of President Richard M. Nixon..</p>
                <p>My talks with the Chinese were very, interesting both to Washington - and I am
                    sure - to Beijing as well. It was the first time they were talking to us
                    'imperialist dogs.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your relationship with your counterpart was
                        normal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, yes Bill, it was quite a normal relationship. As a matter of fact, it
                    developed into what might in those days be called a 'friendship'. As you can
                    imagine, it was quite difficult to become friendly with a Chinese communist in
                    those days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ping-Pong players were the symbol of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. When I left Paris, the Chinese Consul General gave me a
                    gift of a rather inexpensive Chinese screen wall hanging. But I'm sure it was
                    one of the first gifts that was given by the communist government to a United
                    States government official by a PRC representative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you dare tell anybody you got it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, yes. Everyone in the Embassy knew it. In fact - just the acceptance
                    of this token gift was the subject of telegraphic exchanges with Washington! I
                    was instructed to reciprocate in kind! I don't know where the wall hanging is
                    today. I believe I threw it away - during one of our many moves around the
                    world.</p>
                <p>In any event, it was a very exciting period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that through those three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, throughout the three years. Well, I think that period was probably
                    about a year and a half.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of that job was also interviewing all these ex-officials in the
                    Vietnamese government. All these Ambassadors from all kinds of countries,
                    Ministers of government, etc. Many of them had been directed by our Ambassadors,
                    our Embassies in various parts of the world, “Oh, go to Paris. They'll take care
                    of you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Take care of you” in what sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, take care of you and get you a visa. They'll get you to the States.
                    “You'll feel much more at home in Paris. You can study there. You'll speak
                    French.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Get out of my territory.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. “Go to the next consular district.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But a Consul could have functioned in any place in the
                        world with these people. They were refugees, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>MURPHY: They were, in effect, refugees. One time, I'll never forget, one day my
                    secretary said to me, “You have twenty-nine people waiting to see you.
                    Twenty-six are Ambassadors, and the rest are Ministers.” I said, “Well, qu'est
                    ce qu'on peut faire?” “We have to begin. Should I take them in order of
                    seniority?”</p>
                <p>It was most difficult to work in those conditions because Kissinger and company
                    were promising the moon to all these people and we would have to say, “No, I'm
                    sorry you don't qualify for immigration. You're going to have roots in your own
                    garden.” Or, “You don't qualify for refugee status,” whatever it is, and then go
                    away and two days later we would get a direct cable from State saying “Minister
                    Ngynon Vong Dong Meging Yeon (or what ever his name was ) has been offered a

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...because they were allowed to live in France, is that

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: They were. They were accepted as refugees by the French government. But
                    many of them came to our Embassy thinking they could claim refugee status in the
                    United States as well. So we would have to convince them that they'd been
                    resettled in France and therefore had no claim for resettlement in our
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And maybe many of them had French nationality because
                        they'd lived in ...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - some did, Bill. It was amazing to me to learn how many of these
                    people had very close friends in the highest echelons of our government. They
                    figured that just by mentioning certain names, we would give them visas.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. Hundreds of these people - former Vietnamese government
                    officials - came through our Embassy in Paris - on the way to new lives in the
                    United States. Many more, of course, settled in France and in the Midi there are
                    entire villages which are Vietnamese.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: I think that those people, you mentioned your barber, those people were
                    ordinary Vietnamese that had nothing to do with the government so they could
                    qualify for refugee status. They went to neighboring countries like Laos, Hong

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was a very interesting period. It was also indeed very sad. I thought
                    constantly of the thousands of our fellow citizens who had lost their lives in
                    Vietnam. Such a useless loss of life! There was a lot of sympathy on the part of
                    the French government for the Vietnamese refugees, of course, because of their
                    history in that part of the world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The French accepted many of the people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: You'd be amazed how many they did accept! There are entire villages in
                    France - even today - which are Vietnamese.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, exactly. But I must say that I admire the Vietnamese people greatly.
                    They are a very clever people, extremely family oriented, very intelligent and
                    very hard workers. All you have to do is look around Washington, DC at
                    successful businesses- - or look at the list of Phi Beta Kappa graduates at our
                    universities these days! The campuses of Harvard and MIT are full of Asian
                    faces. I believe they are the hope for the future of our nation and are destined
                    for great things. I would not at all be surprised if there were an
                    Asian-American elected President of the country by 2050!</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Oh - I should mention a rather particular visa case I encountered during this
                    period in Paris, Bill. It involved the noted Soviet musician (cellist) Mstislav
                    Rostropovich - his wife Galina Vishnevskaya and their two daughters. One cold
                    winter day towards the close of business at the Embassy - dark, windy and very
                    cold - as only a Paris winter late-afternoon can be - I was about to see my last
                    appointment of the day - Mrs. Arthur Rubenstein. I believe this was in the
                    winter of 1978. I went out to the waiting room and found her engaged in deep and
                    animated conversation with a short, pudgy Russian who was introduced to me as
                    “Slava” Rostropovich. I confess I did not recognize the name but Mrs. Rubenstein
                    told me he was a well known musician in the Soviet Union. She also offered to
                    translate for the gentleman as he spoke no French or English. It turned out that
                    the Soviet government had given Rostropovich, his wife and children permission
                    to come to Paris for a series of concerts - but he was obliged to return to
                    Moscow immediately upon their conclusion - which was in a week or so - from the
                    date of our meeting. Rostropovich had, in the meanwhile, received an invitation
                    (which he showed to me) to perform three concerts at Lincoln Center in New York
                    City. He had been that morning to visit the consular section of the Soviet
                    Embassy in Paris to request that his passport be amended to permit a week's
                    travel for himself and family in New York. The Soviet authorities laughed at him
                    and said that it would take the Foreign Ministry at least two months to reply to
                    such a request - and the answer would surely be NO! Rostropovich was really
                    worked up at this point in the conversation and threw his passport on my desk.
                    “You tell them they can keep it”, he said to me. “I want to be stateless. I'll
                    give up my Soviet citizenship if they won't let me go to New York.” I calmed him
                    down and told him that I knew my colleague - the Soviet Consul General - and
                    would speak with him in the morning. Rostropovich arranged to return to my
                    office - with Mme. Rubenstein - the following day. In my conversation the next
                    morning with the Soviet Consul General, I explained what I knew of the situation
                    - and told him that his nation would lose one of its greatest musicians if he
                    was unable to obtain permission for the short visit to New York. Needless to
                    say, permission arrived form Moscow in two days - - and off the family went to
                    New York City.....never to return to the Soviet Union! Their flight was
                    denounced in the most vile of terms by the Soviets and the family was stripped
                    of their Soviet citizenship. A couple of years later, Prince Ranier of Monaco
                    granted the family Monegasque Service Passports to enable them to travel at
                    will. We often saw Slava and Galina over the years - and where ever he was
                    performing, my wife and I had gratis front row seats. When he became director of
                    the National Symphony in Washington (Kennedy Center) we often heard him perform.
                    We were invited to both daughters' weddings. Also, at the palace in Monaco,
                    Slava performed for a select group for the 25th Wedding Anniversary of the
                    Prince and Princess. We were guests in the Palace at that time for the weekend
                    of celebrations - having come from Genova where we were posted. Jackie got to
                    hear the concert but, alas!, I was obliged to leave half way through the weekend
                    as that was the time the President Ronald Reagan was shot coming out of the
                    Hilton Hotel in Washington DC......but that is another story. I would only like
                    to say that Slava and his wife are among the most delightful people I have ever
                    met. They will be ever grateful to me for my small part in their escape to the
                    West - at a time when travel was extremely difficult for Soviet citizens - —
                    even world famous Soviet citizens!</p>

                <p>To continue - - - - From the Embassy in Paris, I went on to my next post as
                    Consul in Nice and U. S. representative in the Principality of Monaco.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, one last thing before we leave Paris. You were
                        in the Visa Section all the time in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The entire time, yes. But as I mentioned, much of my work was political
                    in content in addition to being consular. You'll recall that those years were
                    very “political years” - with Vietnam, public protests against U.S. policy in
                    Asia, etc. I worked very closely with our Vietnamese peace delegation meeting in
                    Paris; with our Embassy Political Section, and with other sections of the
                    Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you notice... one last question....... again to
                        compare Paris:had the Embassy improved in terms of the management of the
                        consular section, in terms of the openness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, actually it was a breath of fresh air to see the changes made in the
                    ten year interim period. As a matter of fact, I thought sometimes the
                    Administration of the Embassy had become a bit too relaxed!! David Betts was the
                    Consul General when I arrived in Paris to begin my second tour there. Ruth
                    McClendon was the Consul head of the Overseas Citizens Unit. And, of course,
                    Alice Clement. We did have officers of great experience in the consular function
                    in Paris at that time. I must confess that I sometimes had a difficult time with
                    some of the junior officers, in that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had a generation phase begun?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, it was certainly a generational phase. And also, for the first time
                    in my career, I ran into young officers who were in complete disagreement with
                    our Immigration and Nationality laws. Some of these young officers completely
                    disregarded the laws and regulations - - and had no qualms telling me that they
                    did so! The openness towards superiors was astounding to me. One day a young
                    officer came to my office and said, “I think you should know before I begin to
                    work for you I am listed as a “some-time marijuana user” according to the
                    Medical Unit of the Department of State.” Of course, I was floored. I'd never
                    heard young FSOs make such statements before. I figured that I had better adjust
                    - - but it was not easy!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your leadership and you, aware that this new
                        generation was coming,......that the generation of the '60s had been brought
                        in...... how did you and your leaders face this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Looking back on that period....... All the directives coming out of the
                    Department in those days, especially from the Office of Personnel, encouraged us
                    to help younger officers “develop and grow” at post. In my own case - I
                    appreciated this guidance. I had been out of the United States for almost ten
                    years - - and tremendous changes had taken place on our university campuses. The
                    Department's guidance, in my opinion, was really appropriate. It may not have
                    been timely - and certain disasters occurred before the DOS issued such
                    directives and guidance for managers in the field - but the Department came
                    through in the end. I think this was very necessary at the time. Some of my most
                    pleasurable moments, when I look back, are the manner in which I was able to
                    work with and to encourage junior officers to grow in a professional way. Some
                    of these officers were very discouraged working in the enormous visa mill - that
                    was Paris at that particular period. They were usually first-tour offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe they didn't know the French language that well....in
                        order to enjoy the local...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right, Bill. The city was new to some, them - the language - the
                    loneliness. I am thinking of one particular officer.... the son of an
                    Ambassador. He would come to me almost in tears at the end of a busy work
                    day....and tell me he couldn't stand it anymore. He told me he didn't join the
                    Foreign Service out of choice; he was pushed into it by his parents. He claimed
                    he didn't know his parents well but was raised and educated by nannies and maids
                    at embassies around the world. His parents, he said, were people who were
                    forever going to cocktails, receptions and dinner parties every evening of the
                    week. There was a lot of resentment built up in this young man.</p>
                <p>I simply listened to him and tried to encourage him. I told him that his next
                    post would certainly be much better. I explained how my posting in Cordoba was
                    so different from Paris..... and how you grow at each post; you have different
                    responsibilities.... the work is more interesting in one place than another.
                    Sure, I could understand why he was discouraged in this huge mill in Paris. The
                    lines build up at 5:00 in the morning to get visas....and it was his job to
                    listen to sad tales all day of people attempting to enter the United States. He
                    found it very difficult to refuse a visa application....the sadder and more
                    heart rendering the tale, the more he was inclined to issue the visa!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To me that is true human management. Were you given help?
                        Were your leaders given help from the establishment, from the Department of
                        State, to advise the junior officers this way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I can't recall any specific guidance. We were certainly encouraged to
                    advise young officers .....but no one told us how to go about it. This was left
                    to our own devices. I would often have long talks with these young men and
                    women. Just listening to them was, I think, most beneficial.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>To go back to this particular young man, Bill:when I encouraged him to stay in
                    the service and just accept the next assignment, which I thought for sure was
                    going to be better, he came to me one day and pushed a telegram in front of my
                    face and said, “Now what do you think of that, Murphy?” He was assigned to
                    Lubumbashi!!!.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Yes, before the invasion. So, I had to quickly think of something good
                    about Lubumbashi to encourage him to go there. He did - and he eventually met
                    his wife there. I am really happy to say today this officer is still in the
                    Foreign Service. He is now one of our most distinguished Chinese experts and
                    holds a position of leadership in the Department.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: It's true, Bill: the boss IS very, very important. You have to pay
                    attention to people's gripes: and even if you don't agree with them..... they
                    gripe about work, the way it's done, the way an Embassy is managed, the

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>MURPHY: The assignment from Paris to Nice came about in a most unusual way! I did
                    know Ambassador Watson - via our Chinese talks - fairly well. Normally, as you
                    well know Bill - a consular officer in a large Embassy like Paris would not come
                    to the attention of the ambassador too often !!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Above all, ....an IBM Watson.... an a political appointee,
                        at that!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, that's for sure. Above all, not Watson. But I got along well with
                    him. He did have a serious problem in Nice. Eleanor Hicks, a second tour
                    officer, was our Consul on the Cote d'Azur. Eleanor caused all kinds of
                    headaches for the Embassy in Paris. The story goes that this officer was chosen
                    personally by President Richard M. Nixon to be our Consul in Nice. She was a
                    young black girl who was quite bright and was serving at the time at our Embassy
                    in Bangkok. During a Vice Presidential visit to Thailand, “control officer”
                    Eleanor Hicks came to Nixon's attention. She was assigned from Bangkok to Nice.
                    In spite of her obvious high IQ, I believe the assignment was just a bit too
                    much for her. She was in over her head.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was qualified in the sense that she...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Very bright young lady.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...had French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: She spoke beautiful French. However, she was out to enhance her own
                    image, rather than the government's. It was evident in everything she did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Many people do that!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>MURPHY: That's true!!. But Eleanor was most successful at it. She appeared in
                    every newspaper and magazine in Europe as well as many in the United States.
                    Henry Kissinger once asked me to describe her abilities and to explain what made
                    her so attractive to the European press. He said that at times Eleanor got more
                    press coverage than he did!! As our meeting was six months after he left his
                    position as Secretary of State, Kissinger immediately thought better of his
                    question. He said, “No, they wouldn't let me speak to her when I was Secretary
                    of State, so I really don't have the right to ask you now.” In any event,
                    Eleanor Hicks had her very own Public Relations firm in Nice - and also a
                    contract with a national firm in Paris. She made a movie in Yugoslavia and also
                    she played musical instruments in the Casino bands on the Riviera! Strange
                    behavior for an American diplomat, don't you agree? In short - Eleanor Hicks was
                    the most unconventional consul in the Foreign Service at that time. The final
                    straw for the State Department ( and the immediate cause of my assignment to
                    Nice!) was Eleanor's involvement in a hit-and-run accident on the road between
                    Nice and Cannes. Apparently she ran down an elderly man while she was driving to
                    keep an appointment with the Captain of a US Naval vessel in the harbor of
                    Cannes. She was charged with manslaughter by the local Court. For that reason,
                    she had to be pulled out of the post immediately - especially since French
                    Government were starting to express “concern” at her non-diplomatic
                    activity.</p>
                <p>As you can well imagine, Bill, Eleanor Hicks did not do much diplomatic work at
                    the office. She had no time!! To get the “real story of Eleanor Hicks” you
                    should interview ex-FSO Bill Tilney - recently Mayor of San Antonio, Texas - who
                    served as Eleanor's Deputy during that rocky period in Nice! His stories would
                    make your hair curl!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one small point here. Comparing that tragedy, I mean
                        it is in a sense a tragedy...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I, too, consider the whole episode a tragedy for us as Americans - -
                    especially the damage done to our country's throughout the South of France.
                    There were, at that time, about 16,000 American's residing in the Nice Consular
                    District as well as a huge foreign community. America has considerable influence
                    in that part of France - and many of the third country nationals who lived there
                    were involved with commerce with American partners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pressures are tremendous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: What was most difficult for my wife and I was starting to work in the
                    Nice area. This resulted from the fact that Eleanor Hicks never paid her
                    personal bills on time. Her bills were everywhere - - her residence, the gas
                    company, the phone company, dress shops, etc. The consular was constantly being
                    visited by bill collectors.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Thousands of dollars worth of telephone bills, water bills, gas bills,
                    that were her personal responsibility, but they reflected on the United States
                    government. My wife, who was looking for a residence at the time, was rebuffed
                    at every turn. Real estate agents said, “No, no, the American government - - we
                    can not rent to you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “You don't pay your bills.” But in comparison to the

                        won't call it a “cover-up story”.... but how did the Department handle this
                        tragedy in Nice? Did they talk about Eleanor Hicks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No public announcement regarding the officer was ever made by the
                    Department. Eleanor Hicks was pulled back to Washington very quickly.
                    Unbelievably, within six months she was promoted! The Ambassador in Paris at
                    that time, Kenneth Rush (former Ambassador to Germany and former president of
                    Union Carbide) telephoned me in Nice and said, “Peter, I don't understand how
                    this could happen. How could she get promoted?” I told him that I fully
                    understood the reason! Her superiors at the Embassy never commented on her
                    extra-curricular activity in her annual Efficiency Reports sent to Washington.
                    When a Promotion Board has a report in front of it indicating how wonderful an
                    officer is ...”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You promote her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: “you promote her.” So, that's the reason!.</p>
                <p>From the start of my tour in Nice, I decided that dramatic action had to be taken
                    in order for me to begin to work in that part of France . Eleanor Hicks'
                    outstanding bills just had to be paid before I could begin to do a proper job. I
                    sent a cable directly to the Director General of the Foreign Service, Ambassador
                    Carol Laise - describing the situation and asking that either the Department
                    elicit money from Ms. Hicks for these bills or to give me permission to publish
                    in the local press a statement to the effect that these were private bills of an
                    official American and had nothing to do with the U.S. government. Within three
                    days, I got an answer from Washington saying the check was on its way. It did
                    arrive in Nice - I paid off the debt. The Embassy in Paris was absolutely
                    stunned with this action - especially since I hadn't even sent them a copy of my
                    cable to Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, you went off to Nice because of an emergency.
                        Certainly, it isn't normal for one to be transferred from Paris to a
                        constituent post like Nice after a number of years already in France;
                        usually they like to send you off to the pits of the world. But, because of
                        this emergency, they did appoint you Principal Officer in Nice and United
                        States diplomatic representative to the Principality of Monaco. When you got
                        there, you had first hand experience with France - after all the years you
                        lived and worked there - but tell us now from your vantage point what you
                        considered the assignment to Nice to be in terms of the uniqueness and the
                        pressures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, I'll admit that the pressures were certainly there! I have already
                    explained to you the circumstances surrounding our arrival in Nice and the
                    difficulties we experienced in lodging ourselves in the beginning. What did I
                    think of the assignment to the South of France? I believe that the city of Nice
                    and the surrounding area, Cannes, Monte Carlo, are today - as they were then -
                    unique in the world. I considered myself most fortunate to have been assigned to
                    this historic post - which, incidentally, was at the time the oldest functioning
                    American diplomatic mission in the world! We had a very large American community
                    resident in the area. There were many retired Americans living in the consular
                    district: Many Foreign Service Officers, many former ambassadors, top-ranking
                    military, especially Navy people - who had been formerly assigned to with the
                    Sixth Fleet and, who, following retirement from the military, went to work in
                    that part of the world. I am sure you recall that prior to De Gaulle's expulsion
                    of NATO forces from France, the Sixth Fleet Headquarters was the town of
                    Villefranche s/Mer - where eventually we lived during our tour of duty in the
                    South of France. Many of the families in town had American connections - as
                    there was much inter-marriage between the local population and the U. S. Navy
                    personnel stationed in that beautiful town.</p>
                <p>There were also many wealthy Americans who maintained secondary homes all along
                    the Riviera - from Menton to Toulon. Of course, the natural beauty of the
                    surrounding area is absolutely breathtaking. In the entire Mediterranean basin,
                    I don't think you can find a more beautiful place to live. Some overbuilding has
                    taken place in recent years, especially in the Principality, but, in general, it
                    is still a choice area of the world. Looking back - I still think it is
                    unbelievable that my family and I were able to live on the Riviera - with its
                    beauty, its history....the Lost Generation, the noted painters, the White
                    Russian aristocracy, the glamour and glitter. In addition to the Americans who
                    resided there, there was also an enormous British community ....as well as
                    Swedish, Scandinavian, German, Italian, Belgian.....very international. During
                    my time in Nice, many international meetings were held there....always attended
                    by large Washington delegations. (Who, Bill, in Washington, would want to miss
                    “official business” on the French Riviera!!) We were posted to Nice, for a total
                    of two years..... a little over two years.</p>

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>MURPHY: The time frame was from - let's see - from 1975 until 1977. You'll
                    realize that period includes our Bicentennial year. The year 1976 proved to be a
                    killer! It was great for the United States and promoted and solidified
                    Franco-American friendship and cooperation in that part of the country! After
                    many years in France, Bill, you yourself know that the usual canard - The French
                    do not like the Americans - is simply not true!! It is my opinion that you could
                    not find a more pro-American area outside of our nation - than the Nice Consular
                    District - - which included the Alpes Maritimes, the Hautes Alpes, Alpes de
                    Haute Provence, Monaco and the island of Corsica. Just as an example of the
                    pro-American feelings of the local people: - when our Bicentennial Fourth of
                    July celebrations of 1976 rolled around, the city of Nice as well as the city of
                    Cannes closed for three full days, shops, etc., in celebration of our
                    Independence Anniversary. Months of preparation went into these events, which
                    included, concerts, religious services, the visits of a US Navy aircraft
                    carrier, the Flagship of the Sixth Fleet, several parades with both US and
                    French military participation; receptions given by the Mayor of Nice, the Mayor
                    of Cannes, the Prince and Princess of Monaco, street dedications in Bar-sur-Loup
                    - the birthplace of Admiral DeGrasse - a French hero of our Revolution. The list
                    goes on and on........!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the French did play an important role in our
                        Independence, didn't they?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's exactly it..... and many of the heroes of the American Revolution
                    came from that area of France. Several of Admiral DeGrasse's men, for example,
                    who fought in the battles of the Chesapeake Bay and Yorktown came from the
                    Riviera and especially the island of Corsica. The historic connections between

                        of Monaco, didn't you, Peter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - of course - with the presence of Princess Grace of Monaco - - the
                    former Grace Kelly of Philadelphia.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The Principality of Monaco is an independent country but dependent on the
                    French for its defense as well as ....its water!</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, well, I guess we can call it an independent country - “up to a
                    point”! Monaco has a semi-autonomous foreign policy. The Sovereign Prince,
                    Rainier III, sends his own ambassadors to several European countries; throughout
                    the rest of the world, he appoints Honorary Consuls General in major cities. As
                    a general rule, however, Monaco follows the French in foreign policy matters -
                    including voting in the United Nations, in which the Principality now has full
                    membership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But how were you accredited to Monaco - - through Paris,
                        through the French connection, or separately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I was accredited separately - - directly from the Department of State to
                    the Ministry of State in Monaco via our Embassy in Paris and the Monegasque
                    Embassy in Paris. I have kept copies of these diplomatic Notes - as I found them
                    quite unique!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it's a separate accreditation when you're assigned as
                        Principal Officer in that country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. ....entirely separate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Nice an expensive place in which to live?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was all a bit overwhelming for us at first, Bill.......mainly because
                    of all the expenses involved in the required representation work. We left that
                    post paupers!! We were never able to save a dime during our years there! The
                    Embassy (read “the ambassador”) was far from generous with the annual allocation
                    of Representational Funds. I recall that we had a grand total of $1,200 for the
                    second year we were in Nice - and that was intended to cover all official
                    entertaining! Even in 1975 such a paltry sum did not go very far!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>MURPHY: To put this into context, Bill....... twelve hundred dollars for the year
                    would actually pay for perhaps ( we're talking about 1975-1977 ) two cocktail
                    parties. That's about what the sum would cover. During our assignment, I
                    received VIP visitors from Washington: Former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller
                    and his wife, Happy, came several times. Henry Kissinger, along with his wife
                    Nancy, came for a week in 1975. Lady Bird Johnson, a delightful lady, came each
                    summer with her friend Mary Lasker from New York City. They rented a very large
                    villa on St. Jean Cap Ferrat which is near Nice and were usually there for a
                    total of six weeks at the height of the summer season. When these people were
                    entertained by the local residents - or by prominent members of the
                    international community visiting the Riviera - - we were usually expected to
                    host return events - - or to arrange for return parties/cocktails at the homes
                    of local residents. My access to important political figures was fantastic - -
                    mainly as a result of the representational responsibilities. During the height
                    of the summer season, Prime Ministers, Ministers of Finance and Foreign
                    Ministers of many of the Arab nations as well as many from western European
                    countries were in residence in the area. Without much difficulty, I had free
                    access to any of these people almost whenever I wished. At times, it was far
                    easier for me to meet with an influential Arab in Nice than for our ambassador
                    to do the same back in the Arab's home country. After all - the Arab was on
                    vacation and after a few drinks, talked freely at dinner parties. As you can
                    imagine, Bill, I sent many interesting reporting cables to Washington following
                    such social gatherings!! But I must admit that the constant representational
                    responsibility got very, very heavy. Throughout the summer season, rare was the
                    night that my wife and I did not have one, two or three engagements of an
                    evening - and almost always in black tie and long dress!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had to return such invitations...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: We were obliged to, Bill. For example, when a Lady Bird Johnson or
                    Kissinger were entertained, we had to arrange some sort of repayment of these
                    invitations to such prominent Americans. I can't recall any visitors ever
                    contributing to our representational funds! On the other hand, I do remember
                    vividly one very large reception that we hosted for the Commander of the United
                    States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. E had invited over 300 officials and
                    friends from the area to a large cocktail party at our home. The Admiral's
                    Flagship's mess sent a huge platter of shrimp cocktail for the event. The next
                    morning, as I was leaving the house to go to the office, I met an officer from
                    the mess coming up our walk. He presented me with a bill for the Flagship's
                    contribution! So much for assistance from the U. S. Navy! Life was indeed very
                    expensive for us. Towards the end of my tour, I got a bit wiser....This was at
                    the time of the Bicentennial celebrations. Everyone wanted to come to “American
                    events” because of the love of America - - - and also their love of parties!!
                    Several hundred people wanted to attend our Bicentennial receptions, and we were
                    obliged to host separate ones along the coast. Finally, with the assistance of
                    Prince Ranier of Monaco, I devised a plan which involved the newly opened Loews
                    Hotel in Monte Carlo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: An American hotel, an American venture....but with German capital ($49
                    Million). Shortly after my arrival in Nice, I helped convince Prince Ranier that
                    such a hotel would actually be in the benefit of the Principality...as well as
                    increase tourism in the area. He had been most reluctant.... thinking such an
                    American-type hotel would bring Las Vegas-type gambling plus hoards of little
                    old ladies with purple hair, tennis shoes...just waiting for the slot machine
                    room to open!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pulling down the machine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Pulling down the machine, right. But, you know, after a while, the Prince
                    began to realize that the era of “luxury tourism” was over. You just couldn't
                    build another Hotel de Paris or Hermitage near Monte Carlo. Besides - the
                    multimillionaires who filled such hotels were few and far between these days.
                    Monaco was full of newly-rich Italians, Germans, Swedes, British - and not a few
                    American long-term residents.After the new Loews Monte Carlo Hotel was completed
                    - and proved to be a smashing success, - the owners (the Tisch brothers of New
                    York and Bob Hausmann - also from New York City) kept asking me what they could
                    do for the Consulate? Well, finally - with the encouragement of Prince Ranier -
                    I thought of something they could do. We decided to have a separate Bicentennial
                    Fourth of July reception in Monaco because the international community was so
                    large there that we couldn't handle it at our home. The hotel arranged a
                    fantastic reception on the hotel's roof overlooking the sea on a perfect evening
                    and it turned out to be absolutely lovely. Not only was there a large
                    representation of the Sixth Fleet (as there was an aircraft carrier in the
                    harbor), but “everyone who was anyone” was present. You know how those things
                    so, Bill!</p>
                <p>Now, I should tell you a bit more about the interrelationship between the
                    Consulate and the Sixth Fleet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good idea - - after all these parties!!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, the Sixth Fleet. Since the early days of our Republic, the
                    Mediterranean and the Middle East were considered to be important - because of
                    commerce and also from a political perspective. The United States kept a fleet
                    in the area - even in days of sailing ships.The presence of our warships
                    signaled our interest in the area - - and was used to “send political signals”
                    even in the 18th century. I recall an old photograph hanging in my office in
                    Nice showing the American fleet in Villefranche s/Mer harbor in 1872. This is
                    the same harbor which was host to the Flagship of the Sixth Fleet until the
                    early ''60s - - when France left the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
                    (militarily) - and threw all NATO forces out of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>To give you an idea, Bill of the frequency of ship visits we handled at the
                    Consulate: in 1977 we had approximately 45 visits of Sixth Fleet ships up and
                    down the coast in ports within the Consular District....Menton, Monte Carlo,
                    Villefranche, Nice, Cannes, Mandelieu. They ranged from tenders and supply ships
                    - - to the largest aircraft carriers of our nation's fleet - some holding 5000
                    to 6000 men. During that year, the Commander of the Sixth Fleet (Admiral Fred
                    “Fox” Turner) made three official visits within the consular district. And, you
                    know Bill, such visits are almost as bad as a Presidential or ambassadorial
                    visit for a small consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, also you had the protection of these Americans, even
                        though they had their military police inside, they were running all over the
                        Riviera.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Indeed ! When you have 6,000 men (there were no women aboard in those
                    days!) in the small port town of Villefranche - things happen!!Well, there's
                    bound to be a few problems.I must say they were much better behaved than the
                    British or the French Navy when ships of those nations visited our port towns.
                    The USO - which was housed in the consulate building - was most helpful in
                    assisting the crew with liberty plans - to travel within the district; visit the
                    local sights or to go skiing in the nearby mountains.On an average, we would
                    have maybe five or six men left behind after the ship took off. The numbers were
                    greater, of course, when an aircraft carrier was involved. The usual reason for
                    “missing the ship” - was oversleeping!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you would have to take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The sailors left behind after the sailing of their ship would either come
                    to the Consulate on their own - or under police escort!! We were obliged to
                    arrange passage - usually by train - to Gaeta (Naples), Italy - the port of the
                    Commander of the Sixth Fleet and the home port for many of the Sixth Fleet
                    ships. Its is interesting to note that Naval regulations obliged the servicemen
                    to reimburse the travel from their monthly paychecks! Uncle Sam provides no free
                    rides!Now, let me tell you a bit of what we did for the many ships which visited
                    the district. Our ports were most popular with the crews for liberty because of
                    the natural beauty of the area as well as the legendary welcome the crews
                    received from the USA and also the local American and French residents of the
                    Riviera. Local residents went out of their way to invite the men (there were no
                    women n Navy ships in those days!) to home cooked meals or to other
                    family-centered events. The most popular ports with the Sixth Fleet were Monte
                    Carlo, Villefranche and Cannes. It is interesting to note that the crews now
                    vote on where they wished to go on liberty - - a big change for the US Navy! The
                    French Riviera always won!Five years later - when I was Consul General in nearby
                    Genoa, Italy - I had only two port calls in the entire five years of my tour!!
                    No one in the Sixth Fleet, it seemed, wanted to rest and recuperate in Italy! I
                    guess its must have been our beaches in Nice and Cannes!</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or chasing certain attractive, local....lovelies!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly, especially on our fabled topless beaches in the area!</p>
                <p>Now, we not only took care of the crew and saw to their welfare during the four
                    or five days they usually were with us..... but we also furnished the ship with
                    provisions to continue its journey. The Consulate in Nice arranged for the
                    delivery of tons of perishable goods to to the ship in port. This usually
                    involved the provision of thousands of gallons of ice cream and milk, fresh
                    vegetables, breads...anything else not provided by the US Navy supply ships
                    which prowled the Mediterranean. Many items, such as dairy products or fresh
                    meats, came from the Scandinavian countries - and that involved shipments
                    arriving in Nice or Cannes under Custom seals from the point of origin to the
                    ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We,.....being the Consulate. There was nobody there to
                        help you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No - we had no military personnel assigned to the Consulate during my
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No military assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, the consulate staff did all of this work for the U. S. Navy...and had
                    done so for many years. The Consulate did a tremendous amount of work in
                    connection with ship visits. Communications and financial involvement were our
                    main preoccupations at the Post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the military help at all financially?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The US Navy, of course, paid for all of the supplies as well as the
                    transport. We, however, at the Consulate were obliged to coordinate everything
                    else. As you know, communication with a ship at sea is not always the easiest
                    thing to arrange, Bill!!The naval attach�'s office in Paris helped, and ...once
                    in a while... someone would come down from that office during a ship
                    visit......a large carrier, for example. But we basically did it all. It was a
                    disaster for us, of course, whenever a ship visit was cancelled at the last
                    minute - as frequently happened when a ship received a “Change Order” from the
                    Pentagon. Q: Melting ice cream.....that sort of thing?</p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - exactly ! We would receive a call from the ship telling us of the
                    cancellation - and instructing us to donate the ship provisions to local
                    charity. This was a more difficult task than might first appear! Before we could
                    donate fresh vegetables, milk, cream, ice cream, cheese, etc to the local
                    hospitals or orphanages - we had to satisfy French customs! As the merchandise
                    came into France under Custom Seal - it was not actually on French soil -
                    according to the bureaucrats at the Customs. (Our Custom people would interpret
                    the regulations in the same manner, I am convinced!) After the usual couple of
                    days of debate regarding the payment of custom fees, we gave away the U. S.
                    Navy's goods to local charities. I assure you that we never paid a Franc in
                    custom duty!!</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>On another subject: international meetings and conferences. Several important
                    gatherings took place in southern France in the two years I was posted in Nice.
                    Many took place in Monaco - while Nice and Cannes were also favorite sites. One
                    fascinating conference in which I participated together with a large American
                    delegation was that of the International Hydrographic Organization Conference.
                    The meeting takes place every five years in a different country - in spite of
                    the fact that the international headquarters of the International Hydrographic
                    Organization is located in the port of Monte Carlo. At least twenty hydrographic
                    vessels converged in the harbor at Monaco for this event - Soviet, Chinese as
                    well as our own! As you can imagine, we were very interested in the ships from
                    the Communist nations - given the fact that they were seldom considered solely
                    dedicated to hydrographic research in the world's waters!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very famous Frenchman has his sea venture in Monaco,
                        didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That right, Bill - Jacques Cousteau. Cousteau was at one time the
                    President of the Monegasque Oceanographic Museum - which is one of the wonders
                    of the Principality. It was started by Rainier's grandfather, Prince Louis II -
                    who was a sea-faring man who spent much of his long life collecting the contents
                    of that museum. It's a fascinating place to visit.</p>
                <p>So - with all these meetings and conferences on the Riviera - we had a constant
                    coming and going of top American businessmen, U. S. Government officials,
                    Members of the Congress, the Young Presidents Organization, participants in the
                    Cannes Film Festival, and various other organizations from the United States
                    that held meetings on the Riviera.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size of your staff at the Consulate to help
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I had one Vice Consul who concentrated on consular work - of which there
                    was a lot! Just think of the Social Security work in an area where we had over
                    8,000 retired American citizens! A Political - Commercial officer was assigned;
                    the Drug Enforcement Agency had an officer there as well. The local staff
                    numbered seven (7) - including the driver/GSO Foreign Service National.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe the reader doesn't fully understand how consuls are
                        involved in Social Security matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>MURPHY: One is eligible for Social Security in the United States at the age of 62
                    or 65, depending on individual choice. This eligibility is effective within the
                    United States - or in a foreign nation, if one happens to live outside the
                    country. At the present time, MEDICARE is not available abroad - but full
                    coverage by Social Security is allowable. A potential beneficiary - child,
                    orphan, handicapped, or aged - would come to us at the Consulate for assistance
                    with the various forms for submission to back their claim. In addition at that
                    time, we also distributed the actual checks - either by mail or in person. The
                    work also entailed constant investigation into possible false claims - for
                    example, claiming for someone long dead - - or claiming funeral benefits more
                    than once. Once we did discover that funds had been paid out in error due to
                    fraud - it was no easy task for us to extract the funds owed the U. S.
                    Government from the perpetrators. I recall one 96 year old lady who lived in a
                    two room hut high in the mountains offering to kill and sell one of her chickens
                    each month to repay the Social Security her $400 debt. I think I recommended the
                    cancellation of that debt - if I recall correctly!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other beneficiaries, such as children...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Actually, should there be a physical disability, a widow or widower can
                    receive Social Security benefits for the partial support of their under-aged
                    children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You pay them? The consul pays out this money?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The consul and his staff actually does all the work in assisting the
                    American citizen to apply for these benefits. In actual fact - the national
                    employee responsible for Social Security matters provides this assistance. In my
                    Foreign Service career, I never met one single Foreign Service Officer who was
                    intimately familiar with the several Social Security forms necessary for the
                    processing of a claim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So all of the Americans you dealt with on the Riviera were
                        not all wealthy types?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No, they weren't. As a matter of fact, we also had in the consular
                    district several formerly wealthy people who resided there in very humble
                    lodgings. As an aside, Princess Grace of Monaco was marvelous in ferreting out
                    such people. She would call me at the consulate and tell me of their plight. I
                    didn't have time to visit all of these people but she would take this on - with
                    my wife Jacqueline - and together they would visit - and evaluate the needs of
                    the citizens. Sometimes Grace would bring her two eldest children, Prince Albert
                    and Princess Caroline, to help clean these peoples' apartments. She herself
                    would bring food from the Palace. I think it was a good education for her
                    children. It certainly showed them another side of life. Grace's actions were
                    very touching - all the more so because her charity was done without the least
                    bit of fanfare. No one ever knew what she was doing - or who she helped - either
                    in person or through her own generosity. I have never read anything about this
                    in all that has been written about her untimely death. For this reason I want to
                    record her kindness here - - so that someone will know what a kind and
                    charitable person she was. She may have had a privileged position in the country
                    - but she was ever thoughtful of those less fortunate around her. Through such
                    contacts, my wife and I got to know the Prince and Princess very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly couldn't have helped these people out
                        financially without the help from the local community, could you?
                        .....someone such as Princess Grace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right, Bill, but our Consulate in Nice was very fortunate in
                    having an exceedingly large welfare fund at our disposal. From this fund, we not
                    only repatriated American families without recourse to the Department of State
                    Welfare Funds - - but, from time to time, even paid peoples' rent, heating
                    bills, telephone bills as well as emergency hospitalization - including
                    expensive hospitalizations!.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “We” - being not the United States Government, but acting
                        on behalf of this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - acting on behalf of what we called the “American-British Welfare
                    Association of the Riviera”. The money in this association was administered by
                    the British Consul General in Marseille and myself. We two would meet once a
                    month to review investment options on the approximately $300,000 fund total.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this money was from the local community, the Americans
                        and British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No, it wasn't. The Fund itself was the result of the sale of the Queen
                    Victoria Memorial Hospital in Villefranche s/Mer. The hospital itself was built
                    at the turn of the century in Villefranche - at a time when the Riviera was full
                    of visiting and resident Englishmen. Shortly after the establishment of NATO and
                    the choice of Villefranche s/Mer as the home port for the United States Sixth
                    Fleet, it was realized that a Fleet Hospital was necessary. During those years,
                    there were many U. S. dependents living in the Nice area. The hospital in
                    question was taken over and operated by the Sixth Fleet. It was a Godsend for
                    the hospital - as the British residents of means were fast deserting the
                    Riviera! The U. S. Navy completely refurbished the hospital - but retained its
                    quaint name! When the Fleet was expelled from France by General De Gaulle, a
                    heavy blow was dealt to the hospital. Eventually it fell on bad times and was
                    closed as it had no major financial support - with the departure of the U. S.
                    Navy presence in the area and the diminishing numbers of British residents.
                    Eventually the hospital was torn down and - because of the exceptional site
                    overlooking the beautiful bay of Villefranche - it sold very well!! The money
                    realized by this sale was the basis for the American-British Welfare Fund which
                    we administered for the benefit of both communities. The Trust still exists to
                    this day and I believe it is one of the largest (if not the largest) “welfare
                    funds” existing at any consular post in the world today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And people like your wife and Princess Grace and other
                        Americans helped out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Bill. There were women and some men as well - usually retired
                    businessmen - who would help with this charitable work. I rarely had time to go
                    personally to investigate the living conditions of these people. Also - we
                    frequently had citizens come to the consulate who had been robbed of their money
                    - and tickets home; or women with children abandoned by the husband and left
                    stranded in France. Then - as in all diplomatic posts - we had several Americans
                    in jail, in hospitals - and not a few in the French Foreign Legion at their
                    headquarters on the island of Corsica!! This was a bit unusual - as such a
                    military unit exists only in France - and we had the training headquarters in
                    our consular district. I recall a few times when we had Americans escape from
                    their basic training units on the island - and show up at our door! I guess they
                    just couldn't take the severe training undergone by Foreign Legionnaires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have done a bit of name dropping with our American
                        citizen, Princess Grace. Tell us a little bit more about the relationship
                        that developed with you, how did you get to know her? I know you're the
                        official representative of the government in Monaco ....but what does this
                        mean practically?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Monaco is a very special place, Bill. Smaller in size than New York
                    City's Central Park - its financial influence throughout the world is
                    considerable. The fact that an American citizen was wed to the Chief of State -
                    and a Sovereign Prince at that - was indeed unique. From the very start of our
                    tour there, Princess Grace could not have been more gracious towards Jacqueline
                    and me. She facilitated my work in the Principality and included us in every
                    major event of international importance - - and there were many during our time
                    there. I recall distinctly our first meeting. A few months after our arrival -
                    and move into our new home in Villefranche - we received an invitation to attend
                    a Sunday afternoon concert with the Princess at Monte Carlo's Garnier Opera
                    House. We arrived 15 minutes early and were escorted to the Royal Box. As you
                    can imagine - for a kid from Boston to be in such a situation was, to say the
                    least, a bit daunting! Before the concert began, the Princess' other guests -
                    her sister-in-law Princess Antoinette and a few others, gathered in a private
                    room for drinks and introduction. Grace made us feel at home at once. It was a
                    very special afternoon - and, as luck would have it, a very close friend was
                    visiting Monaco that afternoon and attended the concert. At dinner following
                    this event, we had a lot to talk about! Grace was as nice and as kind as you
                    have always heard and read about. Well - you know, Bill! You have met her in
                    Paris! She was the driving force for many improvements in the Principality: the
                    revival of the Ballet Russe of Monte Carlo, the founder of the Monte Carlo
                    Garden Club - which she invited Jacqueline to join; and - of course - she
                    attracted the best in the entertainment field to perform at events year round in
                    Monaco. We were indeed fortunate to be included in many of these public
                    manifestations. She and the Prince together planned the American Bicentennial
                    events in the Principality.. Also - never did an American ship call at Monaco
                    without the Princess being interested in the entertainment of the officers and
                    crew. The Sixth Fleet loved to visit Monaco! I believe that we became so close
                    to the royal couple because of the children.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>We were posted there at a time when Prince Albert was contemplating his higher
                    education: his father opted for a College in Switzerland while Grace wanted an
                    American university for her son - and future ruler of the country. I was
                    unofficially enlisted by the Princess to attempt to convince her husband of the
                    value and benefits of Albert's going to the United States to further his
                    education. The young prince had attended schools in the Principality from
                    kindergarten through his high school. In his last year at the Lycee in Monaco,
                    his parents spent much time consulting with and investigating colleges and
                    universities in Europe and also in the United States. One day when I was
                    visiting at the Palace, the Princess pulled me asked and told me that Prince
                    Ranier was insisting that Albert attend a German-speaking university in
                    Switzerland. Grace thought it would be too difficult for him - especially given
                    the fact that Albert's German was almost non-existent! She herself favored an
                    American education for her son as she though it would give him a bit of
                    independence and also assist in drawing out his personality which, up to that
                    point in his life, was rather over-shadowed by his two sisters - especially by
                    Caroline. Albert was indeed a shy youth - always most obedient to his parents
                    and much like his mother in temperament. His sisters, on the other hand,
                    inherited their father's Mediterranean temperament. In Grace's way of thinking,
                    receiving a university education in English in America would also perhaps assist
                    in correcting the young Prince's speech impediment. Albert have had a problem of
                    stuttering from the time he was a child and, in spite of numerous medical
                    consultations all over Europe, it continues to this day. He has improved greatly
                    in his ability to overcome this affliction.Following my conversation at the
                    Palace with Grace, I wrote away for catalogues on various American colleges. I
                    concentrated on schools in the New England area - as Albert was familiar with
                    northern New England since he had attended summer camp for three or four years
                    together with his sisters. After much discussion, Amherst College in Amherst,
                    Massachusetts was selected as about the right size school and also the right
                    location. It is, as is well known, a college with an excellent academic
                    reputation. I should point out that Albert was never known for his academic
                    excellence - although he was a diligent and conscientious student who usually
                    managed a “gentleman's C average” in most courses. It took a couple of visits to
                    the Palace for me - together with the Princess - to convince Prince Ranier that
                    Albert would be better off at school in the United States. Rainier was worried
                    about: abduction, the dangers of drugs and drinking - i.e. aside from the
                    possibility of abduction, they were the usual worries of any parent sending his
                    child away to school far from home. In order to reassure the Prince, I enlisted
                    the aid of a good friend, a Jesuit priest I had known from my days in Paris,
                    Rev. William Russell, S.J. - to assist in this effort. Bill Russell located the
                    family of two professors at Amherst who were willing to offer lodging with their
                    family. Their offers were later declined when Albert insisted on living in a
                    dormitory - and then a fraternity house - like the other students. In addition
                    to locating a security company willing to take on Albert's security needs, Bill
                    Russell identified a fellow Jesuit-professor on Amherst's faculty who agreed to
                    provide Albert spiritual guidance - should the need arise. On a visit to Boston
                    and Amherst, Princess race consulted with Father Bill Russell about these
                    matters concerning Albert's schooling at Amherst. After much discussion, it was
                    decided that the young Prince would be better off without constant security in
                    the form of a body-guard - and that he would fit better into college life if he
                    started out living in a student dormitory. During the first three years of
                    Albert's schooling at Amherst College, we were assigned to the Department of
                    State and lived in a modest house in the Dominion Hills area of Arlington,
                    Virginia. During those years, Prince Albert came to Washington to spend long
                    weekends with us. Our boys loved having Albert in the house: he was like a big
                    brother to them! Prince Ranier and Princess Grace were ever so grateful for our
                    looking-after Albert - especially during his first year at the College. I'll
                    never forget his preparations for his first visit from Amherst - to our home in
                    Washington. (Keep in mind that he had never before actually planned a trip on
                    his own ........to say nothing of going to buy an air ticket!) He called me and
                    asked - “How do I get down there?” I had read in the papers that a few weeks
                    previously Albert had gone to New York City with a Monegasque buddy who was a
                    student at nearby William's College. I asked him how he had gone to New York -
                    and Albert replied , “In the private aircraft of one of my Dad's friends”. I
                    told him that he had better look up the bus schedule from Amherst to either
                    Springfield or Boston - where he had to catch a plane. I told him we would be at
                    National Airport in Washington to meet his plane. During those weekends he spent
                    with us in Washington, he frequently went out at night with another good friend
                    - Jean Charles van Essche who was from Monaco, grew up with Albert and was a
                    student at Georgetown University. He also spent one of his Thanksgiving Holidays
                    at our home with us in Arlington, Virginia. During Albert's visits, we managed
                    to show him all the tourist sites - visited the White House, the National
                    Gallery of Art and - to his delight - the National Air and Space Museum. On one
                    of his visits to us in Washington during the winter, Albert rented a car in
                    Amherst to drive to the airport in Springfield, Massachusetts too catch his
                    flight. It was a stormy night with the New England roads covered with snow.
                    Somehow Albert managed to bump the car in front of him - and skid off the road.
                    No damage was done and Albert was not injured but on his arrival at National
                    Airport I know that the experience had shaken him. He talked of nothing else all
                    the way home. Shortly after we arrived back home n Arlington, Princess Grace
                    telephoned from London to speak with Albert. He began the conversation by
                    telling her all about the near-accident and, in the telling of the story, he
                    became more and more excited about the incident. I then spoke with the Princess
                    and learned that she was calling from Buckingham Palace where - in 10 minutes
                    time - she was to give a poetry reading before the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen
                    Mother and her guests for the benefit of one of the organizations of which she
                    is Patron! It was really not the best time for Grace to receive alarming news
                    about her son - and I assured her that he was fine - and that no great damage
                    was done as a result of the accident in Massachusetts. We also visited Albert at
                    Amherst - one time attending a Christmas concert of the College Glee Club of
                    which he was an active member. Since no member of his family could attend, he
                    was very appreciative that we had driven all the way from Washington for the
                    event.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Albert is a very nice fellow and had a heart of gold. He is very much like his
                    mother in temperament and personality. With his father, his relationship is at
                    times a bit strained. I believe that his father would like his son to become
                    tougher - and to learn to say NO to people when it is necessary.</p>
                <p>It was Albert who telephoned me in Genoa in September of 1982, the day after his
                    mother's tragic death, to ask if I could possibly come to Monaco to spend time
                    with his father at the Palace prior to his mother's State Funeral. I, of course,
                    drove over to Monaco from Genoa at once and remained with the Prince for the
                    entire day prior to Grace's funeral. Without any doubt, this visit of condolence
                    to the Prince was one of the most difficult I have ever made in my life. We
                    talked all day long - just the two of us - in French, English and at times in
                    Italian. He was often inconsolable and broke into tears. In addition, Rainier
                    didn't want to receive anyone - even including members of the late Princess'
                    family who had arrived from the United States...her brother, Jack Kelly, and her
                    two sisters plus her cousin, (Secretary of the Navy) John Lehman. With an
                    officer of the Ministry of State, the Prince and I went over the plans for the
                    State Funeral in detail - including the reception of the foreign delegations -
                    The President of Ireland, Nancy Reagan, Princess Diana, Danielle Mitterrand, and
                    many other notables. Before returning to Genoa for the evening, the Prince
                    insisted I stay for a private Mass in the Palace Chapel where Grace's remains
                    were resting prior to the Funeral the next day in the Cathedral of Monaco. As
                    Prince Ranier, Caroline, Albert and I entered the chapel - I remember feeling
                    rather strange at being the only outsider there with them. Already assembled in
                    the small chapel were Grace's relatives who had come from the United States for
                    the funeral and, up to that point, had not seen Prince Ranier. The following day
                    - after the Funeral itself at the Cathedral - the official delegations sent by
                    various governments to Monaco were received at a reception in the Palace garden.
                    Rainier did not feel up to speaking with anyone - and he and the children went
                    to their private apartments in the Palace. He asked Jackie and I to help
                    introduce the guests to one another. This was rather a tall order - introducing
                    the President of Ireland to Princess Diana, for example! I knew, of course that
                    he had not been invited to Charles and Diana's wedding in Westminster!</p>
                <p>Grace and Rainier had panned to come to see us in Genoa in October of that year -
                    a month after Grace's fatal accident. They were to have stayed with us for four
                    days - and visit the international Genoa Boat Show - one of the largest in the
                    world. Following the Princess' death, I managed to convince the Prince - with
                    Albert's assistance - that they should both follow through with the original
                    plans. They did come to Genoa and remain in our home as guests for three days.
                    Rainier even purchased a huge sailing boat at the Boat Show - which took a year
                    to build in a small fishing village near Venice. It was their first excursion
                    out of their Palace since Grace's death. As you can imagine, in the glare of the
                    world press, it was most difficult for them - and also for Jackie and me, I
                    might add! In spite of the difficulties with the media during the visit to
                    Genoa, I think that Prince Ranier appreciated our help in easing his sorrow at
                    that period of his life.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>During our Washington assignment following our return from Nice in 1977, Princess
                    Grace, too, stayed with us in Arlington, Virginia. During that time, Grace was
                    on a Poetry Reading Tour of the United States together with a British actor from
                    the Royal Shakespearean Company. They performed at Harvard, Princeton and, in
                    Washington at the Hartke Theater at Catholic University. I can assure you, Bill,
                    that our accommodations in the Dominion Hills area of Seven Corners in Arlington
                    were a far cry from the Palace in Monaco - - or Roc Agel - the Grimaldi country
                    home in the mountains above Monaco - or even their town house on Avenue Foch in
                    Paris!! We had a tiny, three bedroom rented home which had a living room capable
                    of holding a party of six! It didn't seem to bother either mother or son one
                    bit, however; both Grace and Albert made themselves right at home. One snowy
                    afternoon during her visit, I remember Grace sledding with our sons Paul and
                    Marc down the hill in back of our home. As Paul and Marc were both too young to
                    come with us to the evening poetry reading at the Catholic University theatre,
                    Grace did a shortened version or her poetry reading in our living room just for
                    them in our living room. I'll never forget their big round eyes as the looked
                    and listened to her every word. She had a way of fascinating children and a
                    marvelous way with children. It was not at all difficult for her to communicate
                    with ease at their level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you say, she seemed to be full of American
                        energy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. Princess Grace was mainly responsible for making the Principality a
                    cultural center in Europe during the years she lived in Monaco. She especially
                    promoted American art - painters, musicians, singers, dancers - all of whom
                    performed or exhibited with their European peers during that period. Grace's
                    American “know-how” always showed through anything she sponsored or was actively
                    engaged in. Grace did not always have an easy time of it! She arrived in the
                    Principality as an American with her film star background. Monaco was a foreign
                    country to her; she was not comfortable with the language. In spite of her
                    convent education and her comfortable background growing up in Philadelphia,
                    nothing could have prepared her for the spotlight in which she found herself
                    upon her arrival in Monaco for her “fairy tale” wedding. In spite of her world
                    acclaim as an actress - she was not of royal blood - but of a mixture of Irish
                    and German ancestry. Many of the “locals” in Monaco never let her forget this
                    fact. In addition, Grace was not a university graduate. She often mentioned to
                    me that in her early years in Monaco, she felt quite lonely - shut up in her
                    gilded palace - with very few real friends in whom she could confide. I think
                    that it was mainly for this reason my wife and I were quickly accepted by the
                    Grimaldis - - and made to feel at home whenever we were with them. Grace,
                    especially, craved close friendships.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Although, as the spouse of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco, Princess Grace was
                    always at center stage wherever she went in Europe or America - I can attest
                    that she did have her family priorities straight. I would like to leave the
                    following striking example with you to illustrate how Grace, as a mother and
                    spouse, ordered her life. You have perhaps heard of The International Variety
                    Club - an organization composed of actors and internationally known political
                    figures - engaged in financing modern hospital facilities for handicapped
                    children. This international organization held an important anniversary meeting
                    in Monaco in 1975. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was invited to
                    speak at the Club's annual gala dinner and to receive their Humanitarian of the
                    Year Award. Naturally, Dr. and Mrs. Kissinger were invited to spend the duration
                    of the meeting (a four day weekend) at the Prince's Palace. Many international
                    figures were also attending the event including the organization's President,
                    Prince Philip of Great Britain and Lord Mountbatten. The Prince of Wales, Prince
                    Charles, also was present as he was being inducted by his father as a member at
                    the closing gala dinner.</p>
                <p>Due to the fact that Kissinger was no longer Secretary of State, the Consulate
                    technically had nothing to do with his visit. However, because of the volatile
                    world situation at the time, the former Secretary still had a State Department
                    security detail with him when he traveled abroad. Naturally State kept us
                    advised of Kissinger's travel plans via official cable. Three days prior to the
                    designated day of arrival of the Kissinger party - including his wife Nancy -
                    the Prince called me in the office in Nice to ask if indeed Dr. Kissinger was
                    comin- and if he was going to accept his invitation to stay at the Palace. When
                    I confirmed his arrival, the Prince told me that they had received no
                    communication from Dr. Kissinger. I told Rainier that I had said nothing to him
                    - or to the Chamberlain of the Palace - as Dr. Kissinger was no longer Secretary
                    of State but a “simple private citizen”. Rainier then asked if I could join him
                    and the Princess for lunch at the Palace that day so that “we can figure out
                    what to do with this fellow for four days”!!</p>
                <p>During the luncheon, we made plans to bring Dr. Kissinger to a Monaco soccer
                    game, visit various interesting sites in the area - in addition to the Variety
                    Club activities. The Prince thought there should be a small reception for him -
                    and I mentioned that, upon driving up to the Palace that morning, I had noticed
                    the huge yacht of Sam Speigle (the movie director) in Monte Carlo harbor.
                    Rainier thought it would be a great idea to ask Mr. Speigle to host a cocktail
                    reception prior to the Club gala at the Sporting Club. He, of course, didn't
                    want to ask him himself to arrange a party - so he handed me the phone - and I
                    called. Mr. Speigle was, of course, delighted to have such an opportunity to
                    entertain both the Kissingers and the Prince and Princess of Monaco. The event
                    was very nice - with about 28 of us present aboard Speigle's huge yacht. Carry
                    Grant, whom my wife had never met before, was also present at the party. He was
                    a very close friend of the Princess and was frequently in Monaco.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>To get to my point, Bill - at the end of our “planning luncheon”, Princess Grace
                    asked me to do her a favor. She said that when I met the Kissingers at the Nice
                    Airport upon their arrival from New York the next day, she'd appreciate my
                    giving her apologies. She told me that she would not be in Monaco to serve as
                    their hostess - nor to attend the evening's Variety Club celebrations. She said
                    that she would, however, be back the next day. I really couldn't believe my
                    ears! ....with Princes Philip (President of the Variety Club that year) and
                    Prince Charles in the Palace as house guests - plus the Kissingers! I asked her
                    where she was going and she explained that her youngest daughter, Stephanie, was
                    to receive her First Communion at an 8:00 A.M. Mass at her school in Paris the
                    morning after the Monaco Gala evening. She said, “I can't possibly be up 'till 2
                    AM at an official dinner and be present in Paris for the Mass”. It then struck
                    me that Grace really did have her feet on the ground - and had her family
                    priorities right!</p>
                <p>When I explained the situation to Kissinger at the Airport the next day - he
                    looked a bit bewildered - but said not a word. The evening went off very well -
                    and, true to her word, the Princess was back from Paris the next day to play her
                    role as hostess to all of her distinguished house guests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People didn't treat Kissinger that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, but he really took it well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you tell him the real reason?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - of course. And Kissinger said, “Oh, she's absolutely right. We
                    fully understand.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talk about name dropping and whatever, and obviously
                        these pressures on both you and Jackie were near to unique - - if not
                        unique. How did you walk through them keeping your balance and not slipping?
                        Because it's so easy to slip into ego. Your predecessor perhaps was part of
                        it?</hi>

                <p>MURPHY: Bill, I fully realize this! I hope that the reader of these words - at
                    Georgetown University or at the Foreign Service Institute - will not think of me
                    as a simple “name dropper”. We can all do that in the Foreign Service - because
                    we have such particular jobs which allow us into unique situations and hence
                    meet unusual people. I am simply trying to tell it like it was - or , at least,
                    how I viewed the world at that time. Being in such a situation is very “heady”
                    and you have to keep reminding yourself that next week the Department may send
                    you to Lagos or Nouakchott!! It is the old “Sic transit gloria
                    mundi....syndrome!!) but you know, Bill - it is difficult to explain how Jackie
                    and I managed to maintain this friendship with Rainier and Grace over the years.
                    In effect - I guess you could say that they were both rather lonely people - -
                    and appreciated meeting “normal” people - instead of the rather phony
                    multimillionaires who resided almost year-round in Monaco - and on most of the
                    Riviera. We had many fun nights together - and on the occasion of their Twenty
                    Fifth Wedding Anniversary in April of 1981 - when I was posted to Genoa as
                    Consul General - Jackie and I were invited to spend the long weekend at the
                    Palace with them. It was truly memorable since Miroslav (Slava) Rostropovich -
                    who was also a Palace guest together with his wife -gave a private performance
                    in the Throne Room for very few guests after we finished a super anniversary
                    candlelight dinner. I had known “Slava” from my Paris days when I convinced my
                    Soviet counterpart to grant him permission to visit the United States - because
                    without his government's permission, he intended to go anyway!! This was prior
                    to his having been stripped of his USSR citizenship - - and Rostropovich never
                    forgot my part in his “American adventure”. Another evening I recall with the
                    Grimaldi Family was one hot night in late August when Rainier, Grace, their
                    children, us with our boys and about 6 other friends had a midnight picnic on
                    deserted beach near Monaco. We built a bonfire, roasted hot dogs and drank a
                    “vin tres ordinaire”! Even when, in later years, we returned to the Riviera for
                    summer visits, we were always invited to spend a day with Grace and Rainier and
                    the children either in Monaco or at their summer home in France overlooking the
                    Principality in Roc Agel. It was pretty relaxed up there in the mountains in
                    their old farmhouse: Grace would cook hamburgers on the grill on the outside
                    terrace overlooking the sea while Rainier and Albert enjoyed showing showed Paul
                    and Marc and me their fantastic antique car collection.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are still good friends with Prince Ranier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes........I'd say that we are still quite good friends. We have
                    corresponded for years - and we write to each other about every subject
                    imaginable! I should point out, Bill, that my friendship with the Prince of
                    Monaco is well know by our government. The United States Government has used
                    this friendship to attempt to further our “national interest” on more than one
                    occasion. I guess this is just - - since if it were not for my government
                    position in Nice and Monaco - this unusual friendship never would have
                    developed. That's what diplomatic relations are all about - isn't it, Bill! This
                    has been the name of the game since the days of the Medici - and Lorenzo Il
                    Magnifico!</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>The first time my relationship with Rainier was “used” by the Department of State
                    was in 1977 during my tour in the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after you left Nice that this relationship
                        was............</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. The event I am speaking of occurred after I left France was working
                    with Barbara Watson in the Bureau of Consular Affairs in the Department. The
                    Ayatollah Khomeini had returned to his native Iran from Paris and took over the
                    country - - much to the surprise of our government - and Ambassador Sullivan!! I
                    guess our political officers in Paris - as well as those in Tehran - did not
                    feel that the religious element in the political equation at the time amounted
                    to a hill of beans - and thus their energies were concentrated on continuing our
                    policy of supporting the Shah of Iran.</p>
                <p>You'll perhaps recall that after the overthrow of the Iranian government, the
                    Shah of Iran was given refuge in Cairo. He became seriously ill and flew from
                    country to country consulting the best doctors of each. I guess that someone in
                    our government - the White House, CIA or State??? - had moral qualms about the
                    manner in which we had dropped the Shah (rather like a hot potato!!) and
                    announced that we were “actively” seeking a place of refuge for the Iranian
                    royal family “which would be in keeping with the dignity to which they had been
                    accustomed. At that time, as I mentioned, I was working as a Special Assistant
                    in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. I was about to leave on an official trip to Eastern Europe
                    (inspection of our posts in Poland) when I received a special request from the
                    Secretariat. I was asked if - while on this particular trip - I minded stopping
                    in either Paris or Monaco to meet with Prince Ranier. The object of the visit
                    would be to attempt to convince the Prince to grant the Shah, the Empress and
                    the family political refuge in the Principality of Monaco.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were looking for a home for the entire royal

                <p>MURPHY: Yes - They were looking for a home for them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they at the time? In Cairo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I believe they were in Cairo the time. This was prior to their travel to
                    Algeria and then Mexico - - where they later took up residence for a time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shopping for a place to live? To die, actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. The Shah was very ill at that point - cancer. Prince Ranier was
                    most receptive to the request and said that they could all reside in Monaco. He
                    did lecture me at length on the errors of Washington in the whole Iranian mess -
                    and thought the U. S. Government had no moral character to have turned its
                    collective back on the Shah in the manner in which we did.The Pahlavi family
                    never did make it to Monaco - but went instead to Mexico - always seeking
                    medical attention. It is ironic in a way that months later - when the Shah was
                    about dead - I personally gave the Consul General in Mexico City (Vern McAninch)
                    verbal authorization to issue Non Immigrant Visas for the Shah and his wife when
                    he had to be rushed to the United States for urgent medical treatment. I recall
                    that it was late in the evening and - as sometimes happened in the Assistant
                    Secretary's office - I was still at my desk! Mac called to say that a private
                    plane was about to depart Mexico for the United States with the royal couple
                    aboard. He asked for permission to issue temporary visas - and I'll tell you
                    that it didn't take me a second before telling him to go right ahead! He
                    hesitated a bit - noting that I had not consulted any political types - but I
                    just assured him that there would be no problem - and if there happened to be
                    some flack - I would take the heat!! I was so ashamed at the way our government
                    had treated this family that I could not but agree to let them into the country.
                    I never did hear any objections to my action that evening!</p>
                <p>After the request that I approach Prince Ranier in the case of the Shah and his
                    family - I was simply amazed to have the same situation repeated once again in
                    1985 while I was serving at our Embassy to the Holy See - - the Vatican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the Vatican, assigned to the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Assigned to the Holy See. I was called again by Secretary of State's
                    office and asked if I would once again “ask my friend in Monaco” if he would be
                    willing to take a political family in exile. This time it was a bit more
                    difficult as the dictator in question was none other than “Baby Doc” Duvalier of
                    Haiti, his wife, and children. You'll recall, Bill, that our government forcibly
                    put Duvalier and his family aboard a military aircraft in Port-au-Prince and
                    flew them to France. They were “dumped” at a hotel near Megeve and we gave “our
                    solemn promise” to the French Government that we would have a place of permanent
                    exile” within two weeks - - if only they would accept the family for a short
                    period of time”. Well - - as you recall - the weeks went by - and our government
                    had great difficulty finding a place to accept the former Haitian leader. I went
                    once again to see Prince Ranier - - who was most forceful in his negative reply
                    regarding “Baby Doc' himself. He said that the wife and children could live in
                    Monaco until they found a permanent residence in Europe or in Africa - “but
                    under no conditions will I accept that good-for-nothing husband.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The family could stay as refugees, sort of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - as refugees, but “Baby Doc” Duvalier would never be allowed into
                    the country. Amazingly enough - the story of “Baby “' and his family does not
                    stop with Prince Ranier's refusal of refuge for the husband. I returned to Rome
                    and almost immediately received another urgent message asking me to put pressure
                    on the Vatican to pressure the Prince-Bishop of the nearest diocese to the
                    Principality of Andorra to allow the Duvalier family to take up residence in
                    that Principality. As you may know, Bill, Andorra is ruled jointly by the
                    President of the French Republic together with the Prince-Bishop of the nearest
                    Spanish diocese (I forget the name of that diocese). When I went to the
                    Vatican's Secretariat of State (their State Department) with this request from
                    Washington. I was told that the Vatican had already received a negative reply
                    from the Bishop in question.....posed by the French some weeks before! The good
                    Bishop was presently on holiday on Mallorca - and did not want to be disturbed.
                    I suggested someone in Embassy Madrid go to the island and try to persuade him
                    in person. The bishop never did give his permission - although President
                    Francois Mitterrand had already agreed to the request. (You see - the French
                    REALLY wanted him out of France!).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, Peter, again, going back with those kinds of
                        experiences, subsequent and at the time, how did you and your wife maintain
                        an equilibrium if you will? How do you stop it from going to your head?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I suppose you are referring to life in Monaco - and the constant public
                    exposure. I think it's just common sense, Bill . You simply have to realize that
                    you are here today - and gone tomorrow! It is the same for all of us in the
                    Foreign Service. You can't let it go to your head.....although in the “old days”
                    I do recall Principal Officers who did have a problem in this regard.....their
                    wives as well! One thing negative about our posting to Nice was the effect on
                    the family. Due to the fact that we were constantly on the go - we did not spend
                    as much time as I would have liked with our boys. They were with us the entire
                    tour - and went to school only a five minute walk from our home. However - at
                    times, we were obliged to attend official events several nights in a row. The
                    two great family periods during the year were our ski holidays - and our summers
                    on the beaches of St.. Tropez! There - we lived in bathing suits and blue
                    jeans!! We all have great memories of our days at the beach - and also on the
                    ski slopes in France and in Italy. I often look back on those days with the
                    greatest of pleasure......and I hope that my family does as well!</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>About my friendship with Prince Ranier - I want to let you know - and anyone who
                    may in the future read these words, I've never divulged any intimate aspects of
                    our conversations or correspondence because I consider him a true friend. I
                    think that Prince Ranier appreciates this aspect of our relationship. I have, on
                    the other hand , saved all of our correspondence over the years and hope that
                    someday someone will find it of interest. Much of the Prince's writings relate
                    to world politics - and some of it not too flattering either to France or
                    Washington! Also included are long comments on his family - and especially his
                    children. As you know, his daughters have not had the best of marriages -
                    especially Caroline with her marriage in June of 1978 to the French playboy
                    Philippe Junot. Perhaps I should leave these papers to my “alma mater” - Boston
                    College or - why not? - to the Georgetown School of Foreign Service!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You separate, in other words, the friendship from the
                        official work you had on behalf of the US government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Most definitely, Bill. I would say that we really became close friends -
                    - as close as a foreigner can get to a Chief of State and his family. I am also
                    fully convinced that because of this friendship I was better able to serve my
                    country and to obtain objectives which were unique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So for financial reasons, you were glad to leave the
                        French Riviera, but for personal and professional reasons, it was sad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right, Bill, I'd say it was very sad in view of the fact that my
                    wife's family resided in the area. In addition we had all made so many close
                    friends throughout the area. The boys, especially, were very much engaged with
                    their soccer teams and other school activities. This was the first time in their
                    lives that they really made school friends. They were just at that age when
                    friendships begin to count. I do believe we did a lot of good work in that area
                    of France and that our nation's image was enhanced by our presence - - in spite
                    of the subsequent closing of the consulate!</p>
                <p>Perhaps I should mention my relationship with Embassy Paris - and the guidance or
                    supervision provided by that large diplomatic post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, tell us of your relationships with Paris. You were a
                        constituent post.</hi>

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, that's right. I mentioned earlier, Kenneth Rush, was the ambassador
                    during most of my tour in Nice. I don't recall if I mentioned his background: he
                    had been President of Union Carbide and also Ambassador to Germany. I've
                    recently read that, at one time, there had been speculation that he would be
                    offered the Cabinet slot as Secretary of State! He really didn't bother us much
                    in Nice; during the two years I served there he visited perhaps four times. On
                    one occasion Ambassador and Mrs. Rush - and Jackie and I - made an official
                    visit to Corsica.....part of my consular district. Talk about a traveling “dog
                    and pony” show!! This is a fine example to demonstrate that all was not fun and
                    games on the Riviera. The job often involved much hard work - coordination,
                    administrative, as well as diplomatic. For the year preceding the ambassadorial
                    visit to Corsica, the island was constantly being blown up by separatist groups
                    who have wanted a “ Free Corsica” for years. The genesis of the visit was a
                    conversation Rush had with the French President (Giscard d'Estaing) at the
                    Elys�e Palace. Rush mentioned to Giscard that he had never been to Corsica - and
                    asked what it was like. Quite naturally. the French President encouraged him to
                    go see for himself. The French were desperately attempting to find a solution to
                    stem the terrorism and return the tourists to that beautiful island. When
                    Ambassador Rush telephoned me to tell me of his conversation, I strongly urged
                    him to put off the trip due to the precarious situation. Only a week before,
                    three Frenchmen were killed by terrorist bombs on the island. Alas! Nothing I
                    said was heeded - and planning for the expedition began at once. Rush was
                    confounded by the fact that he could not bring his ambassadorial limousine to
                    the island - - and I never thought he believed me when I told him it was too
                    large for the Island ferry!!</p>
                <p>Thus - - we planned the trip and we went to Corsica. We were accompanied by our
                    spouses and I believe we stayed there for three or four days. It was an
                    incredibly difficult trip for my wife and me. I, of course, had to plan every
                    moment of our stay - - from the arrival in Ajaccio to the visits to Bastia,
                    Olbi, Corte and the other important areas of the island.It was rather
                    complicated given the fact that neither Ambassador Rush nor his wife spoke a
                    word of French!! (....and Corsica is NOT Paris!) Both the ambassador and his
                    wife were very nice people - but Mrs. Rush had not the slightest interest in
                    France (as far as I could see) and spent her time with her needlepoint!! She
                    rarely made an effort to speak with our hosts and not once expressed an interest
                    in the area or the people. On the other hand - after a few drinks - the
                    ambassador made a great effort to speak with the local officials - none of whom
                    spoke English. He got himself into rather awkward situations because of lack of
                    French. Naturally I attempted to interpret for him - but often, after a formal
                    official dinner - he refused to have me translate - saying that he understood
                    everything. I recall one evening, in conversation with the Communist mayor of
                    Calvi, Ambassador Rush agreed with several of the anti-American ideas the mayor
                    was expounding!! The mayor was amused - and all I could think of was how this
                    conversation would look in the morning's press! Thankfully - it was not reported
                    in the local or national press!</p>

                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - Bill - It was a ludicrous situation. We did have many happy
                    memories of that trip - the friendliness of the Corsicans, the true pro-American
                    sentiments of the majority of the people on the Island. I especially recall - on
                    a previous visit to the island - being completely overwhelmed when I discovered
                    how much the people of Corsica contributed directly to our Revolution and the
                    fight for independence of the United States of America. It came about in the
                    following manner: the French Consul General in Monaco - Melle. Marcelle Campana
                    - was the daughter of a distinguished French diplomat. She was born in London at
                    the time he was French Consul General in the British capital. Prior to her
                    posting to Monaco (for health reasons), she had been French Ambassador to Panama
                    - and the very first French female ambassador! Her family was Corse in origin
                    and prior to my first official visit to the island, she gave me the name of
                    various family members to look up during my visit to Corsica. I recall visiting
                    her sister who had resided in center the charming old city of Bastia. She was a
                    widow and her husband, a noted attorney, came from one of the oldest families on
                    the island. I was invited to dinner at this lady's home - which was itself
                    something out of a novel! The entire house spilled down a very steep hill -
                    overlooking the port of Bastia. Thus on the hill side it was two stories in
                    height - - and on the water side 12!!! As my visit took place during our
                    Bicentennial year (1976), my hostess had gathered together various documents
                    relating to the Bicentennial of the U.S.A. which were continued in her husband's
                    family archives. She presented me with letters from family members who had
                    participated in the Battle of Yorktown with the French Admiral Conte de Grasse.
                    In addition, she gave me an official document signed by King Louis XVI ordering
                    her husband's relative - the then Bishop of Bastia - to cause to be celebrated
                    in his Cathedral a Te Deum in celebration of “the victory of my friend the
                    Admiral de Grasse” in assisting the American nation in its struggle for
                    independence from Great Britain. I found this to be extraordinary - but soon
                    discovered that several Corsican families had ancestors who had participated
                    directly in our Revolution. You will ask: what did I do with these documents!?
                    Well - being a good government bureaucrat and wanting them to be preserved for
                    posterity - I sent them off to the Historical Office of the Department of State.
                    I never received a word of acknowledgment....typical, don't you think? I did
                    take the precaution of having legalized photocopies made for my own use and I
                    still have them somewhere in my papers!! (Al least, I hope I still have them
                    somewhere!! When you move around as we do - one never knows!!)I did enjoy the
                    visits to Corsica during my tour of duty - - they were so different from my
                    daily routine on the Cote d'Azur!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But guidance? You were sort of laden to yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>MURPHY: The guidance in the Embassy was minimal - to say the least. In theory -
                    the Consul General was supposed to supervise the work of the Consulates in
                    France. This was a completely different set up than, for example, in Italy,
                    Germany or Mexico - where the Deputy Chief of Mission was responsible for such
                    supervision.As it was my first Principal Officership, I really did need a bit of
                    guidance. After three or four months on the job,.....with no guidance or even
                    much interest forthcoming from the Embassy in Paris - I decided to “wing it” on
                    my own!! There was certainly enough to keep me busy: the monthly visits of the
                    Sixth Fleet ships; the frequent commercial conferences and gatherings attended
                    by some of America's leading business people; the consular work.....and, of
                    course, the political work of the post. There were very important political
                    figures in our area....many of whom had national prominence. I contributed to
                    the political reporting of the Embassy as well as sending political reports
                    directly to the Department. Jacques Medecin, for example, the Mayor of Nice, was
                    most influential both the consular district as well as in Paris. He was Minister
                    of Tourism at the same time he held the position of Mayor of Nice - as well as
                    Deputy. Unfortunately, he subsequently fell on hard times: exile in Latin
                    America due to implications of corruption while in office. I believe that he has
                    now been extradited to France and is awaiting trial on these charges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In exile, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Jacques Medecin's father had also been Mayor of Nice as had his
                    grandfather before him. The Medecin family was a regular royal family in that
                    part of France. Towards the end of my tour, there was even an American
                    connection within the Medecin family as Jacques had married a Californian.
                    Jacques Medecin's grandfather was a great friend of Jay Gould, of the
                    Philadelphia railroad family, and of his wife, Florence Gould. Florence was one
                    of the personalities of the Riviera and presided over the cultural/artistic life
                    of the area from her magnificent villa in Juan les Pines - near Cannes. She was
                    a very patriotic American - in spite of having lived in France from the age of
                    18 - when she went there as a young bride from California. She remained
                    throughout the war years and was even made an honorary French citizen for her
                    charitable works in the country. She once told me that her husband had donated
                    the magnificent fountains (Neptune &amp; company) located in the center of the
                    city of Nice (Place Messina) as a tribute to his friendship with Jacques
                    Medecin's grandfather. Whenever we had a distinguished American visiting the
                    area , Florence could also be counted upon to entertain them royally (Nelson and
                    Happy Rockefeller, Lady Bird Johnson, Congressional delegations, etc.)</p>

                        realities of Paris and its complexities and inadequacies, you were better
                        off left alone, where you could be your own boss? You were literally your
                        own boss, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Absolutely, Bill. The only time I heard from the Embassy was when an
                    important visitor was to arrive in Nice from Washington or when someone from the
                    Embassy wanted to make a visits to the area. I vividly recall a total of four
                    Inspectors coming to inspect the post. They managed to stay in the area for a
                    total of seven days - including a long weekend. I guess I couldn't blame them;
                    the place was like a paradise on earth. Looking back - I sometimes feel I did
                    not fully appreciate the natural beauty of the Riviera while living there. Of
                    course, having family there, I return often - but it is not quite the same as
                    living in a place. In any event, Bill - No - the Embassy did not show much
                    interest in the Consulate. I was very much on my own - - and fully enjoyed
                    it!!!</p>

                <p>MURPHY: You couldn't do it I don't think without having a solid knowledge of
                    consular and political work - - plus a pretty good knowledge of French. Not just
                    the French language but also an understanding of the French mentality and
                    culture - as well as the French political system. And then, again, having a
                    general, overall knowledge of all functions within the area of Foreign Service
                    responsibility.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's correct. I forgot to mention our anti-drug work at the consulate
                    in Nice. With all that money about - there was little wonder that the “beautiful
                    people” (and even those not so “beautiful”) were tied up in all sorts of drugs
                    dealings. Because the great center for drug production was just a bit to the
                    east of us, the DEA was very, very active in the area</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency)....were they there

                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Bill. At the Consulate we had one DEA agent (Peter Charette)
                    assigned who worked very closely with the French anti-drug police. He would
                    gather information regarding drug running, consumption, and forward that to
                    Washington. Agents in other European or Middle East nations would pass
                    information to him - and he, in turn, to the French police. He would accompany
                    them on raids although he did not, in fact, arrest people on French soil. A lot
                    of these drug laboratories were located in the area around Marseille - but
                    several of the owners of these labs lived in the Cannes, Nice area.</p>

                        district. That was in Marseille, next to you. Peter, we have to leave Nice,
                        don't we? From Nice you returned to Washington. I believe that you were
                        assigned as Executive Assistant to a very interesting Assistant Secretary.
                        Tell us a bit about that experience, Peter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Bill, I did return to Washington at the urging of Bob Hennemeyer -
                    who was at that time Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Consular
                    Affairs. I had met Bob a few months before leaving Nice while at a conference in
                    Vienna, Austria.</p>
                <p>After returning to Washington from Austria, Bob called me in Nice and offered me
                    the job of Executive Assistant to Barbara Watson, Assistant Secretary of
                    Consular Affairs. I had never met Barbara - although, of course, I had heard of
                    her. I know that she was a well-thought-of black woman who had been first
                    appointed by President Kennedy and then seemed to stay on in the Department
                    under Republican Presidents. However - never having worked in the Department
                    before - I hadn't the foggiest clue what an “Executive Assistant to an Assistant
                    Secretary” was supposed to do! I posed the question to Bob - and told him it
                    would be my very first Washington assignment after 15 years in the Foreign
                    Service!! I recall that Bob was rather vague in his reply - saying that the job
                    was what you make of it - and it would depend on how well I got on with the
                    Assistance Secretary.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Well - I took the job and never for one moment regretted returning to the
                    Department simply because of the personality and persona of Barbara M. Watson.
                    She was a fantastic person in many ways. Imposing, the center of attention at
                    whatever gathering she attended, Barbara was a well educated attorney and well
                    spoken woman who was in the right place at the right time! You would never
                    mistake Barbara for a Washingtonian - - she was a New Yorker - through and
                    through!! Her father had been the first black Federal Judge in the history of
                    our nation; her brother is today a Federal Judge in New York City while her
                    sister, Grace, has recently retired from a senior position with the Department
                    of Education in Washington. In addition, Barbara was the cousin of General Colin
                    Powell (RET) who had been Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and “almost” a
                    presidential candidate in 1996. In my entire career, I cannot think of a kinder
                    and more personable person to work for. Barbara was a genuine person - in a sea
                    of rather wound-up professionals at State!! She never minded speaking her mind
                    when she felt she was correct. In my personal opinion, I believe the Department
                    often used Barbara in a most shameful way! By this I mean that they played on
                    the fact that Barbara - as a respected woman and well-known respected black -
                    would be sent up to Congress whenever the Secretary - or ranking Assistant
                    Secretary was to testify on some contentious matter. In other words - they sent
                    Barbara up to take the initial flack - knowing that the committee members would
                    go easier on her than on her superiors! Often Barbara knew little about the
                    subject at hand - - as it was completely out of the Consular Affairs realm.
                    However - obediently up we would go and to schmooze with the Committee Members!
                    We spent a lot of time participating in events like this - which were in
                    themselves very positive for the Department of State as a whole - but for which
                    Barbara rarely received a word of thanks from the Secretary of State - or anyone
                    else!!!</p>
                <p>My life in the Consular Affairs Bureau's “Front Office” (i.e. office of the
                    Assistant Secretary) was indeed hectic - - but very, very interesting! The day
                    began with the birds - about 7:00 AM when I scanned the cable traffic from all
                    posts throughout the world and selected emergency items for the Assistant
                    Secretary to raise (or be aware of) at the Secretary of State's daily staff
                    meeting. Barbara Watson, in her position, was required to be fully aware of any
                    subject which concerned the American public abroad: natural disasters in the
                    world; the extent of American citizen or property involvement is such disasters;
                    our citizens held hostage in civil unrest in Africa or Asia; a visa refused to a
                    noted political leader; Albania's delegation to the UN held up because of visas;
                    an air disaster involving American citizens; a tour bus in Spain pushed off the
                    road resulting in the hospitalization of 60 Americans; a drug bust in Columbia
                    involving members of the US Military as well as young American college kids;
                    —and on and on!! I was so busy in my new job in Consular Affairs (CA) that I
                    often missed the last bus home to Dominion Hills in Arlington, Virginia! If
                    Jackie was not free to come to pick me up at the Department (remember our boys
                    were only in grammar school at the time) I was frequently obliged to hitch-hike
                    a ride up Route 50!! (Good public transportation has always been lacking in
                    Washington! Needless to say, the living accommodations of our modest house in
                    Arlington left a bit to be desired after our palatial residences on the Riviera
                    and on the Left Bank in Paris fronting the Bon Marche........but we came back to
                    reality!!</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>We did have a very interesting visit in our modest home in Arlington, Virginia
                    however: in the winter of 1978 Princess Grace of Monaco visited the United
                    States. She came at the invitation of the American International Poetry Forum -
                    together with Mr. Richard Pasco, a British actor from the Royal Shakespeare
                    Company. The couple gave poetry readings on the East Coast - at Princeton,
                    Harvard and the Catholic University of America in Washington. Prior to the
                    visit, Grace wrote asking if she could come to stay with us in Arlington during
                    the days she would be performing in Washington at Catholic University. What a
                    visit!! Jackie worked very hard to make sure everything went well. She met Grace
                    at Union Station in Washington when she arrived via train from Philadelphia in
                    the midst of a big snowstorm. She arrived with Her lady-in-waiting, Virginia
                    Gallico, her British secretary and a Romanian-Austrian friend - a young man -
                    named Robert Dornhelm. The Office of Protocol at State had sent a car with
                    Jackie to pick up the Princess at the station - since Jackie was not at all used
                    to driving in a blizzard! On their way down Constitution Avenue - who do they
                    see waiting for the bus to go home in the snowstorm - but yours truly!! (You can
                    imagine the amazed look of the others waiting in the snow storm at that bus
                    stop!!) We had a great visit and attended both of Grace's performances at the
                    university. She seemed to really enjoy being back in the theater once again - if
                    only for a while. She also enjoyed being at hour home - and went sledding in the
                    snow with Paul and Marc! One evening - as they were too small to come to the
                    poetry readings - she took pity on them and recited several children's poems for
                    them before they went to bed They were delighted! A reception for Grace was
                    given by the university and held in the diplomatic reception rooms of the
                    Department of State. Following that - as we had had no dinner - Jackie changed
                    into their night gowns and robes - while I ate in black tie!! (I could hardly
                    get into my pj's now, could I!) The following evening we hosted a dinner at the
                    Jockey Club for a few of Grace's friends, including her cousin and his wife -
                    John and Barbara Lehman, the future Secretary of the Navy in the Reagan
                    Administration whom we had come to know very well in Nice when John did his
                    annual military reserve duty in the Mediterranean. Also present was a Mr. &amp;
                    Mrs. James Boston. Boston is a former priest assigned to Monaco. Grace and he
                    seemed to be very friendly and she had suggested that we invite him and his wife
                    to our dinner party.</p>
                <p>I very much enjoyed working with the CA Bureau management (DAS Bob Hennemeyer,
                    DAS B. J. Harper; DAS John DeWitt) In some ways, we were like large family. As
                    problems arose in whatever corner of the world, we all pitched in to assist.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>I recall that I was on “weekend duty” at the time of the Jonestown tragedy. You
                    can imagine my shock to receive a call at 2:00 AM from Ambassador Burke in
                    Georgetown, Guyana. I was half asleep as he recounted his tale: “Over 900
                    Americans had just committed suicide in the jungle and the Guyanese government
                    was threatening to bury them in one mass grave - using bulldozers - if the
                    bodies were not removed within 24 hours!” Well - I had met this ambassador a few
                    weeks previously. Barbara did not have time to speak with him so I met with
                    Ambassador Burke for about a half hour concerning problems in the country. At
                    that time, we did speak of Rev. Jones and the Americans who had followed him
                    into the jungle. I urged the ambassador, who had never been to the encampment,
                    to pay a visit. ...to no avail! I had a rather odd feeling about him - - like
                    his was a bit “spacey” or something! Well - after he told me his tale of woe
                    while I was sitting on my bed in my pajamas, I said to myself “Gee! I was right!
                    He is rather odd!” Well - the more he spoke and the more hysterical he
                    became...and the more I came to the realization at last that the problem was
                    real and that this was a crisis was unprecedented in the annals of our
                    country!As you can imagine, Bill, there was no more sleep that night: it was
                    spent coordinating with the Operations Center in the Department, White House,
                    Pentagon, Dover Air Force Base, to start in motion the return of the remains of
                    these unfortunate people. One thing I shall never forget in this whole grim
                    business: the United States government was recompensed for every cent spent in
                    dispatching the military to recover the remains of these citizens! This was due
                    to the fact that Jones, the cult leader, had secret bank accounts containing all
                    the funds he had stolen from his followers. They were located in Switzerland,
                    Venezuela and Panama. It took about two years, but finally the government got
                    its money back. (As you well know, Bill, there are no funds appropriated by the
                    Congress for the repatriation of the remains of American citizens. The families
                    of these unfortunates were in no financial position to pay for the shipments - -
                    and there was no time to ask them to attempt to do so! We just made the decision
                    - - and went for it! I told Barbara at the time that “we are damned if we do
                    bring the corpses home to Dover, Del. (the military mortuary headquarters) and
                    we are damned if we don't bring them home and they are eventually buried in a
                    mass grave in a foreign jungle. While this disaster was in progress, Prince
                    Albert from Monaco was making one of his periodic visits to our home in
                    Washington from his college in Amherst, Massachusetts. He came frequently to see
                    us - for company and a few good meals! - during his college days. I brought him
                    to the Department to observe the action connected with the return of the
                    deceased Americans and he certainly received a fast education in Consular
                    Affairs on that visit!!</p>
                <p>In CA I was involved in many exciting and innovative projects:</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Consular Assistance Teams (CAT Teams) This team effort was a concept started by
                    Barbara Watson to assist the consular sections of our embassies throughout the
                    world - - with a minimum of red tape. A post with a problem would cable for
                    assistance; the problem would be studied - physical space; management;
                    inter-embassy relations; crowd control....whatever. I was charged with
                    assembling an appropriate team - architect, FBO representative; CA/EX
                    representative with authority to dispense funds on the spot Visa or Passport
                    experts, etc. I recall leading a team to Havana, Cuba which had been requested
                    by the PO there - Wayne Smith. The problem: three entire floors of the Embassy
                    chancery were filled to the brim with what the Cubans called “the spoils of the
                    Revolution”. To explain: the Swiss, who represented the US since the Revolution,
                    had taken pity on several Cuban-Americans at the time of the Revolution. These
                    people came to the Embassy with their most praised possessions: gold, jewelry,
                    art work, furniture, case of arms - etc. I recall opening a safe containing over
                    $2 Million in unused US currency! There were crumbling boxes filled with
                    diamonds and emeralds; jade and silver of all shapes and sizes. The most
                    impressive sight to me was the endless array of solid gold ingots!! The Swiss
                    accepted such goods for safekeeping - something forbidden by US consular
                    regulations. What to do? We had the stuff now. I recall - together with Rudolph
                    (Rudy) Henderson (L/CA) and Elizabeth (Betty) Swope ( CA/EX) cutting the seals
                    on the various floors containing what to us seemed like the treasures of Ali
                    Baba's cave!! The post wanted us to fly the stuff out on military aircraft - in
                    diplomatic pouches. It was an impossible situation - as the chancery was ringed
                    by Cuban military guards who were ever vigilant for anyone attempting to escape
                    with such treasures. I recall at a dinner at the French Embassy in Havana the
                    French Ambassador asking me to visit his Embassy the following day to see their
                    “American room”. He too - as well as three other foreign Missions - had goods
                    belonging to American citizens. He warned me to be careful as he had released
                    some goods to a Frenchman a few weeks before and the chap was immediately
                    arrested and received a ten year jail sentence! The problems were most complex
                    concerning these “effects”; most of the original owners were now dead - so the
                    rightful owner had to be proven with Court documents indicating ownership.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>On another trip I went to Warsaw, Poznan and Krakow - with Sam Carpenter -
                    formerly Director of EUR/EX. We looked into visa fraud in those three posts -
                    and it was a fantastic experience for me! I had never been to a Communist
                    country - and was impressed how pro-American the Pols really were. Warsaw was
                    cold, dingy and rather unfriendly - with that huge Russian-build center of the
                    University of Warsaw dominating the city. The Pols told me it was referred to as
                    the “Russian phallic symbol” - their gift to the Polish People!! The old city
                    had been rebuilt after World War II in a rather pleasing manner. Food was still
                    difficult to come by - and Sam and I got stuck with several odd meals (a pigs
                    head!!) due to our lack of ability to speak Polish! We visited Chopin's home for
                    a concert - and attended the main Mass in the Warsaw Cathedral on Sunday. It was
                    an eye opener to me to see how the population received their updated news at
                    church -during the sermon! In those days of harsh Communist dictatorship in
                    Warsaw, the church was the only place they could be assured of getting the
                    truth. The days I was there a young priest related the story of the death of 55
                    school children - as a result of their school bus being pushed off a cliff by
                    the drunken Russian driver of a military truck. The reaction of the congregation
                    was anger, shock and indignation. However - there was nothing they could do
                    about it; they had not heard the news before - and the accident had happened
                    only 10 kilometers from the city of Warsaw.</p>
                <p>Poznan was like the dark ages; drab, dirty, dark - and I was followed everywhere
                    by Polish military police. The people were most unfriendly - as opposed to the
                    next stop in Krakow!! What a lovely city - untouched by the ravages of war. It
                    seemed as if everyone I spoke with had a relative in Chicago - or New York!! The
                    cathedral, the Palace and other public buildings were lovely. On the weekend, we
                    drove the consular station wagon (and I was stopped for speeding by the police!)
                    out to the nearby mountains- (the Tartra mountains) where we went up Zakopane
                    peak by horse and sled! It was a lovely experience - - eating Polish sausages
                    and drinking beer in the snow covered mountains on the Czech border.</p>
                <p>We went from Poland to Bern, Switzerland - both to assist the Embassy with
                    consular problems -and also to negotiate with the Swiss government the terms of
                    representation in Tehran. The Swiss had been chosen to look after our interests
                    in Iran. Recalling how much similar Swiss representation had cost us in Havana,
                    I was bound and determined that they would not rip us off again in Tehran.! The
                    Swiss Foreign Ministry representatives began by claiming that they would need to
                    rent a new building - because they couldn't “possibly use a building that had
                    been formerly used by the US government” - the “American devils” as the
                    government of the Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini called us! We insisted they use one
                    of our many buildings in the city. Also - instead of the 10 Swiss diplomats they
                    had planned to send to Tehran to carry out this representation - we told them
                    that two would be sufficient...especially in view of the fact that there were
                    less than ten American citizens residing in the entire country at that time!</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Another trip - this time with Barbara Watson - took me to the Philippines where
                    we were entertained royally by the Marcos couple! Richard (Dick) Murphy was our
                    Ambassador at the time and Barbara was obliged to stay at the Residence - -
                    while I was in a hotel. She was quite upset that she had to follow the
                    Ambassador's social schedule - while I could roam to my heart's content. It told
                    her that it the price of fame and rank - -she was stuck!!! As a result, I saw
                    much more of Manila than Barbara did. I recall going to the main cemetery of
                    Manila on All Souls Day (November 2nd) - a national holiday. The mixture of
                    Christianity and Buddhism was very new to me. I finished visiting the cemetery
                    by having lunch in one of the tombs! As it was raining - as it can only rain in
                    the tropics - our group was invited into a large mausoleum for lunch. At this
                    unusual luncheon, we were surrounded by incense, fruit and vegetable offerings
                    on the tombs - together with the statue of the Virgin Mary. Our host was a young
                    Harvard Business School graduate whose mother cooked the lunch on the “second
                    floor” of the tomb itself. It was large enough for his father's coffin - a table
                    with six chairs plus a TV which ran constantly! No one at the Embassy had ever
                    had such an experience until I arrive! Our work went well: we managed to
                    convince the Philippine government to agree to let the international community
                    use one of the islands off the Bataan peninsula on SW Luzon as a staging area
                    for the hundreds of Boat People coming out of Southeast Asia at that time.</p>
                <p>On we went to Hong Kong: Barbara insisted we stay at the Peninsula Hotel -
                    perhaps the foremost hotel in the Orient. “You only live once”, she said!! (This
                    was typical of Barbara, I learned early in my tour in CA! There was nothing
                    cheap about her. She wanted to do things the way they should be done!!) I must
                    admit that I didn't use my expensive Hong Kong hotel room that much. After a day
                    of meetings at the Consulate General - and other meetings in the town where we
                    discussed with the PRC the very important subject of future American consulates
                    in the People's Republic - and PRC Consulates in the United States - - I
                    wandered the fascinating streets of Hong Kong at night. Nathan Road was as
                    lively at 2:00 AM as at noon!! One day we both went over to the Portuguese
                    colony of Macao, a fascinating place indeed! Barbara knew a very influential
                    priest there - Father Lancelot Rodriguez - who was the son of a Portuguese
                    businessman and a British mother. He spoke the three dialects of Chinese - in
                    addition to Oxford English, Portuguese, Italian etc. He seemed to me to be the
                    Mayor of the colony!! He took us to a typical luncheon on one of the three
                    islands comprising the colony of Macao: Portuguese bread and wine - and the
                    hottest Chinese food I've ever in my life eaten!! What remembrances from my days
                    in Consular Affairs. I also made trips to Ottawa, Toronto, Ciudad Juarez, Panama
                    City (in connection with the Canal Zone Treaty negotiations) and Ottawa - but
                    they were all rather tame compared to Eastern Europe and the Far East
                    ventures!!</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>One of the most stressful time I recall in CA was trying to add to the staff in
                    Tehran - at a time when our Embassy was under constant pressure by the Iranian
                    government - and people. I remember Lou Goelz' (the Consul General there) asking
                    for TDY help to assist the American citizens - and also the Iranian visa
                    applicants wanting to flee the Revolution. I worked for days - attempting to
                    convince recently retired consular officers to go to Tehran. I recall one case
                    in particular: Robert Odd of Sun City, Arizona. It took several phone
                    conversations but he finally agreed to go off to Iran for a month. He was 53
                    years of age - and thus the oldest officer in the consular section in Tehran.
                    Two weeks after arrival in Iran, Bob was in the Embassy when it was taken over
                    by the mob.....and for 444 days he was held a prisoner. His poor wife called me
                    frequently - and what could I tell her!! I truly bled for the people I had
                    convinced to go to Iran to assist the Embassy - and especially for their
                    families. Thank God it ended as it did - and Bob Odd returned safe and sound -
                    but, I am sure, scared for life! I have always felt guilty about the entire
                    ordeal - and blame myself for their fate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after CA, Peter? Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well - I was assigned to Genoa, Italy as Consul General........but before
                    going to Genoa, I was assigned to Senior Training. That took place at the NATO
                    Defense College in Rome, Italy. I spent six months there (fall 1980 to spring
                    1981). I was a member of the Class of 57 at the NATO Defense College - whose
                    Commandant, at the time, was Admiral Sir Lancelot Bell Davis - (U.K.).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that like? How did it prepare you for Genoa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY:I had no idea what I was getting into, Bill - but, believe me, it was the
                    most interesting and enjoyable training I ever experienced in the Foreign
                    Service! First of all, my wife and youngest son, Marc, and I moved to Rome - to
                    EUR, to be precise - that section of Rome created by Mussolini - between the
                    city and the sea. It was a lovely area and we had a FSI furnished apartment on
                    Via delle Montagne Rocciose (Rocky Mountain Road!!)</p>
                <p>I was one of 55 students from various NATO nations. We were five civilians
                    (mostly diplomats) and the rest were military - including four American Army,
                    Naval and Air Force officers. Lectures were conducted in French and English (the
                    NATO languages) - while the whole operation of the College - including the mess
                    - was operated by the Italian military. The schedule consisted of a daily
                    lecture - usually by someone of stature either in the academic or, political or
                    military area. We frequently had Foreign Ministers, Ministers of Government or
                    leading Military commanders from NATO Headquarters in Brussels or from one of
                    the member states as our lecturer of the day. The lecture was divided into two
                    hour long periods in the morning - after which we were free to pose any
                    questions we wished. This was followed by a long Italian luncheon during which
                    we again were free to engage our guest in conversation.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>There were two major trips during my course: one to the US and Canada which stops
                    in Europe at military bases in Lisbon, Portugal;, Toronto &amp; Ottawa in
                    Canada; San Francisco, California; Cheyenne, Wyoming and Washington, DA second
                    tour, in Europe this time, included visits to military installations in Turkey,
                    Greece, Germany, Holland, Belgium and France. At all these stops we were treated
                    like kings and had the very best instruction available. Following a tour of a
                    NATO military installation, or the Parliament of a country - we were addressed
                    usually by the Minister of Defense and the Foreign Minister. All arrangements
                    were military in their perfection - with the sole exception of our visit to the
                    Department of State. We were to be addressed by three speakers - all Assistant
                    Secretaries......but none showed up for the briefing! The Germans, in
                    particular, were disgusted with the Washington arrangements - and I heard about
                    it for the rest of my time at the NATO Defense College!</p>
                <p>The course ended with a mock NATO emergency situation - a “War Game”, as it were!
                    I was - somehow - chosen to act the part of the Secretary General of NATO. It
                    was all great fun - and most amazing to see how the military reacted to such
                    situations! I must say that the civilians had more in common with each other -
                    than they did with their military fellow citizens!</p>
                <p>The NATO Defense College history is quite interesting: General Eisenhower
                    established the College in Paris shortly after the formation of the Alliance in
                    order that the leaders of the Alliance - both civilian and militar- could get to
                    know and work with each other. It certainly worked in my case: I became very
                    friendly with all of the members of my course and, subsequently, when I would
                    have a military-related problem with one of the NATO nations - I would call my
                    buddy in the relevant capital or military base. The problem would be solved in
                    no time flat!! Had this not been the case, from Genoa I would have had to
                    contact our Embassy in Rome; they, in turn, would have contacted the Italian
                    Foreign Ministry: then they would go through their military - to the proper
                    military base. Weeks would have been wasted!</p>
                <p>I highly recommend the NATO Defense College for a senior officer being
                    subsequently posted in Europe - for its academic content as well as the human
                    experience of living and working with NATO members without a lot of protocol and
                    diplomacy!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you enjoy your subsequent posting as Consul
                        General in Genoa, Italy? How long were you there, Peter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY:Immediately following the NATO Defense College, I was assigned to Genoa. I
                    was there from 1981 through 1984. All in all, I consider this assignment to have
                    been one of the most interesting in my career. Now- — - I know you'll say “I've
                    heard this before”. But - to tell the truth, Bill, all of my assignments were
                    interesting and I threw myself into the work with great abandon! I truly enjoyed
                    the post; the American and Italian employees - and most of all the work with the
                    fascinating and wonderful people of Northwest Italy!</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The staff of the Consulate General consisted of a Political Officer, a Consular
                    Officer, an Administrative/Communications Officer; a USIS Officer plus about 16
                    Italian employees. Genoa, as you perhaps know, is one of our oldest diplomatic
                    posts - established in 1763. It is quite logical when you think of it: located
                    in a major port in the commercially active Mediterranean Sea, the city and area
                    was very important in commercial - and political terms - to our fledgling nation
                    at the time of the Consulate General's establishment.</p>
                <p>During my tour there I had consular jurisdiction over the regions of Liguria,
                    Piedmont and the Val d'Aosta. The consulate in Turin had been closed shortly
                    prior to my arrival - so I had all that interesting and beautiful area to work
                    with! I established close contacts with leading Italian industries which were
                    important for American commerce: FIAT, Pirelli, Otto Melara, Ansaldo. I
                    facilitated the entry of several American firms into the local Italian market as
                    well as promoting cultural exchanges with major universities and colleges in the
                    northwest of Italy. I was also active among the Jewish community - especially in
                    Turin - where I made a major address at the main synagogue on the subject of
                    Jewish integration in the United States. The evening was considered rather
                    sensational - especially since the small Jewish community in Turin (reduced to
                    3,000 from a pre-war maximum of 30,000 in the city proper) was mainly composed
                    of Communist professors from the university.The political work of the Consulate
                    General was also fascinating given the fact that most of the consular district
                    was either Communist or Socialist in political representation. The Mayor of
                    Genoa at the time, Fulvio Cerofolini, was no friend of the United States. In
                    fact, Cerofolini went out of his way to ignore our Consulate - and me personally
                    whenever it could earn him points among the electorate! Of course, the Communist
                    Unions were very strong in the port of Genoa as they had been for the past two
                    decades. It was actually because of the strength of the Left that the port of
                    Genoa declined in importance - - it was just too expensive for large scale
                    shipping. Thus - the ports to the south - Livorno and La Spezia - picked up much
                    of Genoa's former business. Many of the political personalities with whom I had
                    to work - Senators, Deputies, President of the Province, etc. were from Leftist
                    parties (PC - Partito Communista or PSI - Partito Socialista Italiana). I got
                    along well with everyone - no matter their political ticket - and managed to
                    travel frequently to the far reaches of the consular district to “wave the
                    flag”. I feel this is a most important part of being a Principal Officer in a
                    constituent post in a country like Italy - or France. So often the officers in
                    the Embassy are desk-bound - - and never see anyone except their counterparts in
                    the Foreign Ministry or the Ministry of Defense.</p>
                <p>Shortly after my arrival in Genoa I found that none of the Embassy experts I
                    tried to invite to make official visits to the consular district were free to
                    come because “of the press of business in Rome”. I solved that! Shortly after
                    the arrival at post of a new Commercial Counselor, Economic Minister or one of
                    the Military Attach�s - I would call them and invite them to hold a conference
                    in - say - Imperia - or Asti - or Turin. They could hardly say that their
                    calendars were full - - so were forced to agree with my suggestions!!</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>Richard N. Gardner was the first Ambassador for whom I worked in Italy. Shortly
                    before leaving the NATO Defense College in Rome to go to Genoa, Gardner invited
                    me to the Villa Taverna for a three hour discussion of the wonders of the Genoa
                    consular district. I vividly recall his providing me with a long list of all the
                    influential Italians who could “do things for me.” When I inquired further into
                    what he meant by this, Gardner proceeded to enumerate those influential people
                    in Turin and Genoa who could lend me a ski chalet for the winter gratis; get me
                    free ski passes; free weekends at mountain resorts, etc. Needless to say, I
                    stayed clear of all of the “contacts” he gave me!</p>
                <p>I enjoyed very much working with Ambassador Maxwell (Max) Rabb - and he was
                    ambassador in Rome for almost my entire tour in Genoa. I recall his first visit
                    to the consular district - when he and his wife, Ruth, first came to Turin. Max
                    was very impressed with the President of FIAT - Avv. Gianni Agnelli, Carlo
                    DiBenedetto and other well know industrialists in the area. We visited the usual
                    round of local officials - Prefect, Mayor, Cardinal Archbishop, FIAT - and the
                    American School in Turin. We then proceeded to Genoa where that same evening we
                    had a black-tie dinner for over 400 Rotary members from throughout Northwest
                    Italy. In the car going to the dinner - which was being held in honor of the new
                    American Ambassador - Max said to me “I'll just speak for a few moments and then
                    you give the main address”. I almost fell over because all of the attendees -
                    and most of the Italian press - would be there to hear what the new American
                    Ambassador to Italy had to say for himself!! Well - somehowe got through the
                    evening. Around midnight, as we were beginning to move towards the door (after
                    such an exhausting day!), I received a call from the Prime Minister informing me
                    that General Dozier - an American General stationed with NATO troops in the
                    Brescia area - had just been kidnaped by terrorists at his home! All hell broke
                    out! Max insisted on driving back to Rome that evening so that he could be at
                    the Embassy the next day. At his age (he must have been 72 then) - and with him
                    being completely exhausted after such a grueling day in Turin and Genoa - I
                    don't know how he made it back to Rome - but he did! Throughout the next few
                    weeks I played an intimate part in the search for Dozier's kidnappers - via
                    contacts with FIAT security in Turin. It was a most interesting time in my Genoa
                    assignment - and one which I would not care to repeat!</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Shortly after this we had a very nice three day break since Princess Grace and
                    Prince Ranier had invited us to be their guests at the Palace in Monaco for the
                    celebrations of their 25th wedding anniversary. It was a splendid weekend -
                    filled with dinners, concerts and lots of fun. However - the night before the
                    actual anniversary - President Ronald Reagan was shot by Mr. Hinckley outside
                    the Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC I remember Grace calling our room about
                    midnight to let us know what had happened. She asked us to come to their private
                    apartments to watch the newscast direct on their television from the United
                    States. (CNN was unknown in those days and it was the first time in my life that
                    I saw a direct broadcast live from abroad!) After such an event, I had to return
                    at once to the consulate - as it would not have looked good for me to be
                    enjoying myself at celebrations with our President in the hospital suffering
                    from gun shot wounds! Jackie, however, stayed for the formal dinner and the
                    private concert in the Throne Room offered by Miroslav (Slava) Rostropovich.
                    Kindly - he sent me an autographed copy of the evening's program telling me that
                    I was missed!</p>
                <p>But, back to Genoa. I have so many great memories of Genoa - the wonderful
                    Italian employees and warm, friendly Genovese we met, a very good group of
                    American officers, as well; the fascinating work, the many CODELS (ugh!), the
                    frequent walks through the “vicoli” - the narrow streets behind the consulate
                    going towards the port; and, best of all, the travels around what I think is
                    (or, I guess, “was” since it has closed now) the best and most interesting
                    consular district in Italy! These streets were like an opera setting: people
                    seemed to live outside in the good weather. There were beautiful churches,
                    fruit-filled markets; old restaurants from which delicious odors floated at noon
                    time; then - there were prostitutes galore on just about ever corner- and even
                    printed signs on various street corners in English left over from World War II
                    warning American sailors not to frequent local prostitutes! We often went to the
                    Cafe where Verdi took his afternoon coffee — and to a nearby baker where he
                    bought bread for his evening meal.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>I really could write a book on Genoa, Bill. The city is a treasure trove - - not
                    from a tourist's point of view, for the city itself is rather ugly in spite of
                    its spectacular location. But - inside the homes of the Genovese you will find
                    artistic treasures found no where else in the world. I remember Marchesa
                    Carlotta Cataneo Adorno showing me an original Raffaello in her bedroom! She was
                    a friend of the Queen of England who, after a State Visit to Rome, came to Genoa
                    for two days just to view Carlotta's art collection. The universities, too, were
                    fantastic - both in Genoa and Turin. I recall that on one occasion, at the
                    invitation of Alberto Bolaffi - grandson of the founder of the famed stamp house
                    - I addressed Turin's Jews in the synagogue of the city on the subject of “Jews
                    in America”. Given the fact that most of the 4,000 Jews living in Turin (down
                    from 200,000 before the war) were intellectuals - and thus leftists - it was a
                    most interesting evening. Never have I seen such security precautions as when I
                    visited the synagogue. The next day Ambassador Maxwell Rabb called from Rome
                    after having read reports of my talk in the national press. “What in the world
                    is a Murphy doing giving a talk about Jews,” he said! He was simply delighted
                    with the public reaction and told me that he could never get an officer from the
                    Embassy in Rome to go out and talk to a group of people on such a subject. For
                    this reason - as well as many others - I truly lament the fact that the
                    government has closed so many consulates around the world. Nice is now closed;
                    Genoa is closed —as is Palermo, Venice.....and Florence is next on the list.
                    Comparatively speaking, it costs so little to keep a permanent presence in a
                    nation - and the result of even a one man/woman consulate is unmeasurable - - -
                    if you happen to have the right officer in place!</p>

                <p>Before leaving the Genoa segment of my career, I want to not how pleased I was
                    that my work there was officially recognized by the Government of Italy. Shortly
                    before departing the post, the Prefect of Liguria (Dr. Pupillo) decorated me
                    with the order of Commander of the Italian Republic. This was a rare distinction
                    for a Consul of any nation. It was the first time in history that an American
                    Consul had been so honored - although several of our Ambassadors - including
                    Ambassador Maxwell Rabb - had been decorated by the Italian government. I
                    learned later that the decoration had been proposed by a group of Ligurian
                    political figures who wanted to express their appreciation for the work I had
                    accomplished in fostering Italo-American relations. In addition, I was made an
                    honorary citizen of the town of Favale di Malvaro (June 18, 1984) in the Fontana
                    Buona. This was the birthplace of Giannino - founder of the Bank of America and
                    Italy in San Francisco. There were several past and recent immigrants to
                    California from that area and the affinity between the United States and that
                    part of Italy was very close. Each year there was a day set aside to celebrate
                    the “return of the Immigrants” - and return they did - together with their
                    children and grandchildren. Jackie and I always participated in the day's
                    celebrations - and we even visited the Ligurian community in California when we
                    were on Home Leave from Genoa. I recall that it was a fantastic event - and we
                    were welcomed with open arms! According to the declaration of the city council,
                    I was granted honorary citizenship as follows “Il consiglio comunale di Favale
                    di Malvaro nella riunione del 18 giugno 1984 ha conferito al Dott. Mr. Peter K.
                    Murphy, Console Generale degli Stati Uniti d'America a Genova - la cittidinanza
                    onoraria di questo comune - “ per il suo amore verso l'Italia, per suo alto
                    spirito di comprensione e difesa dei dritti altrui, per sil suo delicato sentire
                    nell'ascoltare e seguire le istanze degli emigranti ligurii in generale e di
                    quelli dell'entroterra chiavarese in particolare e, infine, per l'affettuosa
                    amicizia e l'attaccamento che il Dott. Murphy nutre per il comune di Favale de
                    Malvaro”. I was very pleased to be so honored by this city in Italy which had
                    contributed so many of its talented sons and daughters to the cultural and
                    commercial enrichment of the state of California and the San Francisco area in
                    particular.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We did our first part with Peter about three or so months

                        to Kingston, Jamaica, from Genoa, Italy. The Kingston assignment didn't

                <p>MURPHY: Right. In July of 1984, I was about to leave Genoa, Italy, where I had
                    been assigned the previous four years, to take up a new assignment as Consul
                    General in Kingston, Jamaica. I had received this assignment by cable from the
                    Office of Personnel at least six months prior to that time. Both Jackie and I
                    had mentally and physically prepared ourselves for an assignment in Jamaica. One
                    week before we, my family and I, were to depart Genoa, I received a call from
                    Ambassador William A. Wilson from Rome. He was at that time our Ambassador to
                    the Holy See ....in fact - the first American Ambassador to the Holy See having
                    been appointed and confirmed by the Senate only a month or so before he called.
                    Our government had, a few months prior to that time, established formal
                    diplomatic relations with the Holy See and Wilson, who was a very close friend
                    of President Ronald Reagan and his personal representative to the Vatican up to
                    that period...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The very first one after the establishment of diplomatic
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Bill Wilson was the very first Ambassador. I believe that there were
                    several reasons Washington decided at that time to establish diplomatic
                    relations with the Vatican. The struggle against Communism was undoubtedly one
                    of the major reasons for the move - as the Church and the U.S. were one in their
                    condemnation of the communist system of government. Also - Washington had
                    evidently learned much about theocracies - from our Iranian experience! Our
                    government was now - at long last - starting to see and understand the influence
                    of moral teachings and religious thought on political events. From speaking with
                    colleagues in Washington, I know that some were a bit surprised when the Vatican
                    used its good offices to recover deceased American servicemen's remains in Iran
                    following a disastrous attempt by the Carter White House to free our people held
                    captive in our Embassy in Tehran. Another obvious reason for the move to
                    establish relations with the Holy See was the unease produced within the
                    National Security Council as well as at the State Department over the Vatican's
                    public disagreement with some of the fundamental proposals and actual projects
                    of the Reagan government - including, first and foremost, its Strategic Defense
                    Initiative. The alarming spread of the effects of Liberation Theology in parts
                    of Latin America was also a contributing factor to this equation. In effect -
                    the reasons our government had for such a move in 1983/84 were far more solid in
                    the eyes of the Congress - as well as a majority of the American people than on
                    previous occasions when the proposal was raised in public. The reaction to the
                    announcement of the establishment of an Embassy was a far cry from that which
                    greeted President Harry Truman when he announced his intention to seek
                    confirmation of General Mark Clark - “Liberator of Rome” - as the first American
                    Ambassador to the Holy See!</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Strange as it may seem, I did not know Bill Wilson well when he telephoned me in
                    Genoa to ask if I would consider accepting a posting as Minister (Deputy Chief
                    of Mission) of the Embassy to the Holy See. I had met Wilson only twice before
                    at receptions or dinners in Italy. I met Bill and his wife Betty at the
                    Portofino home of Amintore Fanfani - the former Prime Minister of Italy and his
                    wife - Maria Pia Fanfani. When I had met with Bill Wilson, I had always found
                    him to be a very pleasant man although I cannot say that I knew him all that
                    much about him - except that he was a Californian and close friend of President
                    Reagan. I knew of his position (which I found fascinating!) and I knew his
                    closeness to the President. I did not realize, at the time, that Bill was the
                    chief of the “kitchen cabinet” and that most of the Cabinet Secretaries were
                    somehow beholden to him for their positions. In any event, there was no one in
                    the top echelons of the Reagan Administration Bill Wilson did not know....as I
                    soon discovered.</p>
                <p>I thought it very kind of him to call me in Genoa.....and really thought the
                    purpose of his call was to wish me well in my new assignment. But after a few
                    minutes, he asked me if I would like to come to Rome as his Deputy Chief of
                    Mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the Mission, Peter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The mission at that time consisted of three officers, plus three
                    secretaries, and one Italian security guard. That was the extent of the Mission!
                    The three officers were the Ambassador, the Deputy Chief of Mission, and a
                    Political Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And its function was solely to represent our government at
                        the Vatican?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, BilActually - the United States government in 1984 established
                    formal diplomatic relations with the Holy See - and NOT the Vatican. The term
                    “Holy See” is the cause of much confusion. Some ask - “ What is this thing
                    called the Holy See?” It is the supreme organ of government of the Roman
                    Catholic Church - and its temporal and territorial seat is the State of Vatican
                    City. Often it is difficult to tell quite where the Holy See ends and the
                    Vatican City begins - and some say that this confusion is by design The Holy See
                    is an entity “sui generis” - - (so styled by the Treaty of Vienna) which, under
                    international law and practice, has an international personality of its own
                    which permits it to enter into treaties and agreements with nations with the
                    equivalence of a state, and to send and receive Ambassadors in this same
                    capacity. The State of Vatican City (Stato della Citta' del Vaticano) was first
                    established in 1929 with agreements (the Lateran Treaties) between the Italian
                    government (Mussolini of course leading the Italian government at that time) and
                    the Holy See (negotiations were conducted by the Secretary of State - Eugenio
                    Cardinal Pacelli - the future Pope Pius XII). The State of Vatican City is, of
                    course, all that remains of the Papal States - which for centuries prior to the
                    unification of the Italian Republic covered most of central Italy - from Bologna
                    to Naples.The Papal States were the seat of the temporal power of the Roman
                    Pontiffs up until the fall of the city of Rome in 1849 when Giuseppe Garibaldi
                    united Italy into one country. The United States maintained consular - and then
                    diplomatic relations - with the Papal States. The last Minister-Resident (as
                    they were styled in those days) to the Papal States was Mr. Rufus King. Mr.
                    King, my immediate predecessor at the Holy See, served as Minister-Resident to
                    the Papal States from 1863 to 1868 when the Congress refused to appropriate
                    additional funds to allow for the continuation of the mission. Thus - Mr. King
                    left Rome 117 years before my arrival at the Vatican! Opposition to diplomatic
                    relations with the Holy See at the time arose not only from the usual
                    constitutional concerns about the separation of Church and State and but also
                    from fears concerning the direct effect of such relations within our nation -
                    such as - the “take over” of the United States of America by Rome resulting from
                    Papal exercise of undue influence on the U. S. Government! In effect, the US
                    government did not “break relations” with the Papal government back in 1868 - -
                    but simply let the relations lapse for lack of funding!! The action of our
                    government was considered - justly so in my opinion! - a most inelegant and
                    undiplomatic way of closing a diplomatic mission. This is especially true when
                    one considers that the Papal government fully supported the North against the
                    South during our Civil War! See how we reward our friends - Bill!!</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>Even after the fall of Rome - and the unification of Italy as a country for the
                    first time in its history - the international juridical powers of the Holy See
                    which were equivalent to those of a State, were still recognized by most of the
                    western European and Latin American nations. This is evidenced by the fact that
                    several diplomatic missions remained in the city of Rome - fully accredited to
                    the Holy See - even after the fall of the City and the unification of the
                    country.....and the absorption of all Papal territory into the Italian State.
                    You must remember that this was years before the establishment of the State of
                    Vatican City - and the settlement of the “Roman Question” - as the problem was
                    styled in the international political arena. During the entire period from the
                    Fall of Rome - until the signing of the Lateran Treaties in 1929 - the Roman
                    Pontiff never left the Apostolic Palaces of the Vatican. It was thus that the
                    Pope took on yet another title - “Prisoner of the Vatican”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were those countries which continued to recognize the Holy
                        See Catholic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Several of them were, Bill. Several of them had large Catholic
                    populations, but also England, for example, had a legation to the Holy See
                    during that period. It was obvious that these nations felt that it was
                    beneficial to have diplomatic representation in Rome to pass on information
                    received - and to have the Vatican understand what their own nation was
                    attempting to do in the area of foreign policy - with the hopes that the Vatican
                    would lend its considerable support.</p>
                <p>So.....in extending official diplomatic recognition to the Holy See in 1984, the
                    United States government joined 120 other nations of the world. As I said
                    previously, these diplomatic missions were not only from Catholic nations - but
                    there were fairly large Embassies from, for example, Japan, Syria, Egypt,
                    Algeria, Indonesia, Yugoslavia, Korea,....and, believe it or not, one of the
                    largest missions was that of the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran. I suppose the
                    Ayatollah considered his embassy rather like sending an ambassador to another
                    “theocracy”!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is, as a United States diplomatic Mission, totally
                        independent of our Embassy to the Italian Republic?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. It is completely independent of our Embassy to Rome. We have nothing
                    to do officially with the Embassy...... although all our administration support
                    comes from the Embassy. By that I mean our classified communications; financial
                    support; personnel support in general, all administrative support.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>As a matter of interest, Bill - perhaps I should point out that the Vatican City
                    does have its own administrative, legislative, and judicial organizations. It
                    has a civil Court system - and even its own jail. I've only heard of minor
                    criminals being kept in their jail and during my tour of duty, there were no
                    prisoners. The Turk who shot Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square during a
                    Papal ceremony, actually committed his crime within the State of Vatican City -
                    as the Piazza of St. Peters is Vatican territory. However - the Vatican quickly
                    seeded jurisdiction to the Italian government in this case. The Vatican has its
                    own national flag and monetary system - based, of course, on the Italian Lira as
                    well as a national anthem written by Gunoud. The State also issues passports -
                    tourist, official and diplomatic. All cardinals of the Sacred College of
                    Cardinals (the supreme body of advisors to the Pope) automatically are granted
                    Vatican citizenship - and a Vatican passport - upon their elevation to the rank
                    of cardinal. As far as I know, this fact has never been challenged in the
                    American legal system whenever a new American cardinal has been named by Rome.
                    There have been instances, however, when Papal Nuncios (ambassadors) - of
                    American nationality - have had their US citizenship's challenged in US courts
                    based upon their being the official representative of a foreign nation. This
                    question arose in the mid ''50s. One such case involved the Apostolic Delegate
                    (an American cleric) in London in the early part of this century. Interestingly
                    - the United States did not, at that time, recognize the Holy See as a State.
                    Perhaps the case was thrown out due to the fact that the American in question
                    was only an Apostolic Delegate (personal representative of the Pope to the
                    Church in a country) as opposed to a Papal Nuncio (an Ambassador of the Pope to
                    a foreign nation - and also his representative to the local Church).</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. It is an independent state - and recognized as such by over 170
                    nations today (1996).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Holy See's ambassadors are not called “ambassadors”,
                        are they? Are they not called Papal Nuncios?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, ambassadors of the Holy See are called Papal Nuncios (”nuncio - from
                    the Latin meaning “to announce”). According to the Treaty of Vienna, a Papal
                    Nuncio is the de facto dean of the diplomatic corps in most of western Europe
                    and most of Latin America. If the nation is nominally Catholic in religion, the
                    Nuncio is Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. This is, I should think, a matter of
                    courtesy to the Pope's personal representative. It is not the case in
                    non-Catholic countries. For example, in the United States, the papal
                    representative is called the Pro Nuncio, the “Pro” indicating that he (there are
                    no female Papal Nuncios....yet!) is not Dean of the Diplomatic Corps.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Ambassador Wilson had had a DCM....a fellow by the name of Donald Planty.
                    Don had been assigned to Rome for a very short period of time. There was a
                    personality conflict between the two men and various newspaper articles
                    involving Wilson and Swiss bankers precipitated Don Planty's departure from the
                    post. Wilson suspected Planty had leaked information to the press. Thus, Wilson
                    told me was looking for another Deputy Chief of Mission. I never believed for
                    one moment that Don Planty had cause to leak information. Mr. Wilson was a very
                    suspicious person and took immediate like or dislike to a person. (Example: he
                    suspected that my secretary - Mrs. Kelly, had also been involved in the press
                    leak with Mr. Planty. Before leaving Rome shortly after my arrival he demanded
                    that I get rid of Mrs. Kelly - stating “I shall not return to the Embassy if she
                    is still working here”.) I, of course, was rather upset to hear the reason Don
                    Planty left the post after a few months! Due to the nature of the assignment,
                    however, I pleased to think that Bill Wilson would think of me and want me to go
                    to Rome to work with him. Don's abrupt departure, however, did, in fact, worry
                    me! When Bill actually proposed the job to me, I thought him terribly naive -
                    especially given the fact that my assignment to Jamaica was made months in
                    advance. It is just not done, as you well know, to break an assignment in two or
                    three days and go on to another one! Bill simply called the White House and told
                    the office of personnel that he wanted me assigned to the Vatican.......simple
                    as that!</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>MURPHY: His power base was considerable - as you shall see! In fact, I have never
                    worked with anyone before or since who had such connections directly with the
                    President of the United States. At the time of the formation of the first Reagan
                    administration, Bill Wilson was the de facto leader of the “kitchen cabinet”. He
                    assisted the President-Elect in choosing most of the Cabinet members. The
                    President and Bill Wilson had known each other for many years; Bill helped
                    Reagan purchase his ranch in California; he held Reagan's financial portfolio
                    during the entire presidency. In addition - and most importantly - Bill's wife
                    Betty was perhaps Nancy Reagan's closest “best friend”. Incidentally, Betty
                    Wilson was also Chairman of the Board of Pennzoil Corporation!. So - the Wilsons
                    came from the wealthy class of Californians who rallied around President Reagan
                    and worked many, many months for his election to the Presidency. As opposed to
                    many of the California group of “Friends of the President' I met during my years
                    in Rome, Bill and Betty were distinguished and represented the nation with both
                    dignity and intelligence. I cannot say the same of several of the other members
                    of the “California friends of the Reagans” I met over the years in Rome!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With that kind of base, I would have speculated he would
                        have ended up in a more powerful position........... with all due respect to

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: William Wilson is a convert to Catholicism, a former Episcopalian, and as
                    some converts from one faith to another - more “Catholic than the Pope”. For him
                    to be - initially - Personal Representative of the President of the United
                    States to the Pope, following in the footsteps of Myron C. Taylor and Henry
                    Cabot Lodge and Robert Wagneand finally - the First American Ambassador to the
                    Holy See - was to Bill a very great honor and a key position in today's world. I
                    recall Bill telling me one time how President Reagan became convinced to open
                    diplomatic relations with the Holy See: At the conclusion of the Queen of
                    England's State Visit to Canada in either 1982 or 1983, Queen Elizabeth II and
                    her spouse, Prince Philip, called at San Francisco aboard the Royal Yacht H.M.S.
                    Britannia. There she entertained President and Mrs. Reagan at a formal dinner -
                    during which time the subject of diplomatic relations with the Vatican arose in
                    conversation between the President and the Queen. The Queen, according to Bill
                    Wilson, told Reagan that she was delighted that the United Kingdom had raised
                    their relations from that of Legation status to that of a full-fledged Embassy
                    some years before. The Queen provided the reasons she felt such an Embassy was
                    important to her government and the benefits the British felt they gained by
                    being there in Rome. Bill said that this conversation clinched it for President
                    Reagan - who was always influenced by anything English! The President made this
                    decision to recognize the Vatican in spite of the strong opposition of his wife
                    Nancy who was opposed to the entire project. This was, according to Bill Wilson,
                    one of the very few times that Reagan acted in opposition to the wishes of his
                    politically active wife!</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>I know that Bill Wilson saw his new position as a “worldwide or global position”.
                    I shall explain this in more detail later. The Mission at the Vatican is, in
                    fact, rather like our Mission to the United Nations in New York. The influence
                    of the Holy See throughout the world is considerable. Whether you agree with
                    this influence or not, it is a fact of political life!! This influence exists -
                    and millions upon millions of people follow the policies set by the Holy See.
                    Diplomacy is, of course, not just a one-way street. While we were trying to
                    influence the Holy See, the Holy See was trying to place its stamp on United
                    States policies. A few such instances come to mind: the activity of the Holy See
                    on the international debt problem of Third-World nations; the political
                    situation in Lebanon - and the entire problem of the Middle East; pressing for
                    assistance in improving human rights for members of the oppressed Catholic
                    Church in various parts of the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations - as
                    well as in China - with the problems of the nationalistic “Patriotic Catholic
                    Church”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Albeit, without an army, the Vatican still has power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. Everyone remembers that famous quip of Stalin: “How many
                    divisions does the Pope have? “</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>When working with the Holy See on matters involving world-wide political
                    situations, one has the feeling that one is dealing with “diplomacy” at its
                    finest. The Vatican has had many centuries of experience in diplomacy - and the
                    Vatican is never in a rush; like the Chinese, there always seems to be time to
                    wait, say, for a change of government or a political figure! The art of
                    diplomacy is usually defined as the attempt to gain one's objectives by rather
                    skillful manipulation of one's opponents - through strategies which those
                    opponents often do not even comprehend until they are accomplished. I think that
                    diplomacy tends to be especially ineffective in situations where ideology rules
                    (Iran, Bosnia, Northern Ireland, Algeria, Cuba, the former Soviet Union) - - -
                    where contending parties have beliefs which they consider matters of principle
                    and about which they have passionate convictions. Without a doubt - practicing
                    the art of diplomacy in such situations demands great skill - and not a little
                    patience! Over many centuries, the Holy See has frequently had to resort to such
                    diplomatic maneuvers simply because it lacked the military and political power
                    necessary to obtain its objectives by any kind of force. Thus, the Vatican - of
                    necessity - became expert in the true art of diplomacy and for this reason, a
                    diplomatic posting to the Holy See is normally considered to be the highlight of
                    a diplomat's career. I know for a fact that most European diplomats - as well as
                    African, Middle Eastern and Latin American diplomats - are of this opinion. At
                    the time of my appointment, no living American career diplomat had had that
                    unique full-time “Roman” experience as we had no Embassy at the Vatican. There
                    had been a couple of officers who were assigned to assist Henry Cabot Lodge and
                    Bob Wagner - when they served as Personal Representatives of the President in
                    Rome but with the personal title of Ambassador. As the Representatives came most
                    infrequently to Rome, the officers had little to do and usually worked at
                    Embassy Rome for most of the time. For these reasons and, admittedly, the
                    prospect of living and working in the Eternal City, I was really delighted to be
                    appointed the Deputy Chief of Mission at the new Embassy of the United States to
                    the Holy See. I saw the job as one full of opportunity: for my country, for
                    humanity in general (if we could ever convince the Holy See to recognize
                    Israel!) - and also for myself and my family. I was very pleased that my boys
                    would have the opportunity to continue to live in Rome for a while. From Genoa,
                    both of them had attended schools in Rome.</p>
                <p>My appointment to the Vatican came about in the following manner. When Bill
                    Wilson asked me to come to Rome, I attempted to explain to him as kindly and as
                    diplomatically as I knew how that I already had an onward assignment - and that
                    within the State Department at least, things just were not done that way!! Once
                    you are assigned to a post, you g- unless a major catastrophe intervenes.I told
                    Bill I would really love to help establish our new Embassy and thought it would
                    be a great challenge. I told him that throughout my career I had always been
                    very much in favor of establishing relations with the Holy See - - although in
                    my college days I actually wrote a paper against the establishment of such an
                    embassy! (The follies of youth!)</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Bill thought it best that we meet in person, so - without any preconceived
                    notions that my assignment to Jamaica would ever be changed - Jackie and I got
                    in the car, and Bill and Betty got in theirs, and we met somewhere in the
                    outskirts of Florence. We spent a delightful weekend together. At the end of the
                    weekend, Bill told me that he had already called the White House and that he had
                    also spoken with George Shultz, then Secretary of State. We shouldn't have any
                    problem with this thing, said he! And - lo and behold! - there were no
                    problems!! The next morning in the office in Genoa I received a cable from the
                    Office of Personnel. I was called by Henry (Hank) Cohen - then director of
                    Foreign Service Personnel in Washington (whom I had known years ago in Paris.)
                    Hank asked if I was crazy contemplating going to work for Bill Wilson - and
                    taking such a small post where the grade of the job didn't even equate to my
                    present Foreign Service rank!? I insisted that I would like the job; that I
                    thought it was important - and I was told “Good luck! You'll need it - working
                    with that guy “ ! A cable then arrived in Genoa from Washington changing my
                    assignment from Kingston, Jamaica to the Vatican ....and that is how it came
                    about that I was assigned to the Holy See! I know that many of my colleagues
                    will never believe a word of this - but it is the absolute truth of how the
                    change of my assignment came about! Never did I pressure anyone for the job - in
                    fact, I had no idea that the job even existed!! I will confess, however, that I
                    was simply delighted I got it!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this assignment a “direct transfer”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was a “very direct transfer”, Bill ! I recall that Bill Wilson and I
                    met at the end of July 1984 in Florence to discuss the position - and I was
                    actually in Rome - in place at the Embassy - the first week of August of that
                    year! Such a speedy transfer is almost unheard of in the annals of the Foreign
                    Service.What was Rome like that first month - or so? You can just imagine the
                    heat of Rome in August, Bill. ....all the Romans at the beaches and the few
                    tourists (German, American and British!) in the sun filled deserted city. I
                    arrived in Rome alone, because Jackie and the boys had to stay in Genoa to
                    finish the packing of our household.</p>
                <p>It must have been about the 10th of August when I drove into the Eternal City
                    from Genoa to take up my new position. I spent a day and a half with Bill Wilson
                    at the “temporary” Chancery, which was at that time located in as small
                    two-bedroom apartment in Piazza Citta' Leonina, just outside St. Peter's Square.
                    The building was one of several in the city of Rome owned by the Vatican. It was
                    very tight quarters. One of my first tasks was to start looking for adequate
                    quarters for the Chancery, residences for the staff and also space for the
                    Marine Security Guard contingent which was scheduled to arrive in Rome any
                    day.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Bill Wilson outlined to me what went on in the office and gave me the names of a
                    few of his contacts at the Vatican. Of course, I had previously met and known
                    Cardinal William Baum, former archbishop of Washington, and his secretary, Msgr.
                    James Gillen - who proved most helpful as I got up to speed in Rome. At the
                    beginning of our second day together in the office, Bill said, “Well, Peter
                    ...... Betty and I are leaving Rome for about a month and a half. We're going to
                    California. So you'll be in charge - of course.” I was absolutely floored. Here
                    it was - the month of August in Rome....not a soul about; only the ever-present
                    cats in the Forum and Coliseum!! I had no idea where the offices of the
                    Vatican's Secretariat of State were located; I had no identification to get into
                    Vatican City; I had been introduced to no one connected with the Vatican.... the
                    Foreign Minister or any of my colleagues in the diplomatic corps. In effect - I
                    was left to sink or swim!!.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No. There was no one I could ask in Washington - or even at the post -
                    how one proceeds. No one had any experience official dealings with the Vatican.
                    Thank God for Mirella Giacalone and Wanda DiAngelo- two local Americans who had
                    worked in the office before the mission was raised to the status of an Embassy.
                    They were very helpful in helping me find my way! I couldn't have begun to
                    function without their assistance - and guidance</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anyone at our Embassy to Italy? Was there

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY:All my friends at Embassy Rome were very kind, of course - having been
                    colleagues during my Genoa tour. John Holmes, Bob Blackburn, Charlie Stout - -
                    and even Maxwell (Max) Rabb. Of course, they didn't know much about the Vatican.
                    In fact - there was a detectable undercurrent of animosity directed against our
                    fledgling Embassy emanating from Embassy Rome. This stemmed directly from the
                    rivalry between Max Rabb and Bill Wilson - but also extended to the Embassy's
                    Political Section where it was felt that the Embassy to the Holy See was
                    unnecessary and should never have been established.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Not simply a piece of the turf, but, ideologically, several officers-
                    including the then-Political Councilor Charles Stout - did not think the United
                    States government should have recognized the Holy See. It was the old
                    “Church-State” constitutional conflict. I did all I could to unify the two
                    diplomatic missions. I attended Embassy Rome staff meetings from time to time -
                    to give an overview of what we were doing at the Vatican. I also spoke to all
                    newcomers to the Embassy at regular Welcome Meetings - to explain what we did -
                    and how we could be of assistance to them or their visiting relatives who wanted
                    to visit the Vatican.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought we were loyal servants of the Administration and

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, in spite of professional loyalty, everyone has their own individual
                    ideas on such a prickly subject. I certainly found this to be very true in my
                    dealings with all entities of the U.S. government, both overseas and in
                    Washington, during my years at the Vatican. In fact - it was quite a revelation
                    to me. . I never had a job in the Foreign Service like mine at the Vatican. I
                    frequently encountered animosity towards the post itself - from the American
                    public, from members of Congressional delegations and, especially, from my
                    colleagues back in the State Department. During my first year at the post, we
                    averaged at least 8 - 10 hate letters a week. At first, Bill Wilson felt obliged
                    to reply- with a four or page reply!! I convinced him eventually that it was a
                    waste of time and paper.</p>
                <p>My first year was very active because there was so much to do to get a new
                    Embassy up and running as an embassy should!For example, in the administrative
                    realm: looking for a new Chancery, gathering a staff. We had a Political Officer
                    assigned to the post - Louis J. Nigro.Thank God for Lou - he spoke fluent
                    Italian and French and was intimately knowledgeable about Italian and Vatican
                    history. In fact - Lou is now back at the Vatican (1996) in my old job - working
                    for Ambassador Raymond L. Flynn - the former Mayor of Boston whom I briefed for
                    five hours before he took up his post in Rome during President Clinton's
                    Administration!</p>
                <p>Our Administrative Officer - Jim Griffin - was very helpful in setting up the
                    post. He had a very delicate job - attempting to get from Embassy Rome all that
                    Ambassador Wilson demanded - - and he demanded a lot!! Bill Barnes came from
                    Genoa to set up our United States Information Service operation. As Charles Wick
                    (Director of USIA under Reagan) was a personal friend of Bill Wilson's - Bill
                    Barnes had no difficulty in getting everything he needed from Washington to
                    duplicate Embassy Rome's USIA set up!!I began getting to know my colleagues in
                    the other 120 embassies at the Vatican. Not much on a protocol level had really
                    been done at this new post - in fact, during my call on the Dean of the
                    Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See - the Ambassador of the Ivory Coast - he
                    greeted me with “ I am most pleased to meet the first American diplomat to the
                    Vatican. I sincerely welcome you - and your nation”. I later discovered that
                    Ambassador Wilson had never made a formal call on the Dean of the Diplomatic
                    Corps - a major faux pas in a place where they are so hung up on protocol!</p>

                        arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The mission had been there four months.....but up to that point, not much
                    had been done by the Embassy in the way of protocol. As you are well aware, Bill
                    - the smaller the State, the greater the protocol. The Vatican is very, very
                    protocol conscious. This is even true for most of the diplomats assigned there.
                    Because of the fact that for a European, or Latin American, or even an African,
                    an assignment to the Holy See is perhaps about the pinnacle of their career. An
                    example: while I was in Rome, the French Ambassador to the Holy See went on to
                    become the Under Secretary for Political Affairs in Paris and his successor was
                    the former French Foreign Minister. The Colombian Ambassador was formerly
                    President of his country for seven years - while the Belgian Ambassador (Baron
                    Alexandre Paternotte de la Vallee) was the third in the line of his family to
                    hold the position of Ambassador to the Holy See. The German Ambassador's (Mr.
                    Peter Hermes) previous assignment was as German Ambassador to Washington. Thus -
                    we were dealing with diplomats who knew a thing or two; they had many years of
                    service in their nations diplomatic corps and were very proud of their present
                    postings.</p>

                        board from our Embassy to Italy wasn't there for the reasons you stated, so
                        he was sort of on his own, I gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Ambassador Wilson was on his own although he had a wide circle of friends
                    in Rome as he had held the position of Personal Representative of the President
                    to the Vatican for at least three years prior to the raising of the office to
                    the status of full diplomatic mission. Therefore, he did know a lot of people on
                    the social and political circuits. He knew a lot of the movers and shakers in
                    Rome, and he did know people within the diplomatic corps to the Holy See as well
                    as to the Republic of Italy. He knew, much to the consternation of our
                    Ambassador to Italy, many of the leading Italian politicians far too well!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who as our Ambassador to Italy at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: At that time it was Maxwell M. Rabb. Relations between both Embassies
                    were at times rather rocky. The reason for this was mainly because of rivalry
                    over friendship with the President - as well as the division of “perks” to each
                    ambassador and his entourage!.. But you will understand, Bill, such a situation
                    exists in most places where we have two or three ambassadors in residence -
                    Brussels - Vienna, etc. I noticed that all of my colleagues in Rome, no matter
                    whether they were from the Japanese, Egyptian, French, or British Embassies to
                    the Holy Se- they all had similar difficulties with their Embassy to the Italian
                    Republic.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: I was there in Rome from August of 1984 to September of 1988.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - a four year tour of duty - first with Ambassador William A. Wilson
                    and then with Ambassador Frank Shakespeare.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: OKAY - Let's get back to the narrative. So I had to begin “at the
                    beginning” - in principio - as it were!! I really had to start to build an
                    embassy, because many of the ordinary functions of an embassy were not in place.
                    For example, I opened some of the file cabinets - and what did I find:
                    classified and unclassified reports mixed together - and in unlocked cabinets!It
                    was completely understandable; there were no guards and no one who knew the
                    practices of a normal embassy. So -it was really a job of setting everything up
                    - establishing precedent - from soup to nuts.</p>

                    Embassy Rome.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Within a few days of Ambassador Wilson's departure to the United States, I
                    received a call from the Department of State and the newly appointed Under
                    Secretary for Political Affairs, Michael Armacost, came on the phone. Armacost
                    told me that he was new to the job and had most recently been Ambassador to the
                    Philippines. He wanted to make his first official trip in his new position to
                    Europe - and wanted to include the Vatican as a stop. People in Washington quite
                    often do this: decided to go to Europe in the middle of August when everyone is
                    on holiday! In any event, Armacost came to Rome and called on the Vatican's
                    “Foreign Minister” - Archbishop Achille Silvestrini.. (Vatican title: Secretary
                    of the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church - Consiglio per gli Affari
                    Pubblici della Chiesa) ...the first official call of an American Under Secretary
                    of State for Political Affairs at the Vatican. Prior to the visit, Armacost told
                    me that he wanted to discuss several political matters of importance in which he
                    felt the Church could assist in influencing various governments around the world
                    to our position. He mentioned especially the situation in the Philippines...
                    with which he was quite familiar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Vatican, though? He knew the role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I'd say Armacost was well aware of the role and influence of the Vatican
                    and the Church, its influence in various parts of the world. It was a most
                    successful visit. I recall going to lunch with Armacost following our morning of
                    meetings at the Vatican. We spent two hours on a hot August afternoon discussing
                    the potential of our small embassy. He was excited about the fact that we now
                    had a new source of information which he predicted would become invaluable in
                    the future. We also discussed the “ideal” American ambassador for the Vatican
                    post. I told him - as I subsequently told others from Washington - that in my
                    opinion the best possible ambassador would be a career Protestant or Jew. I
                    realize that, for political reasons within our government, such an appointment
                    may never be made by the White House. In spite of this, however, I feel strongly
                    that we should take a lesson from other nations. England, Germany, Canada,
                    Mexico, South Africa - for example - send their best people to Rome; religion
                    does not enter the equation and thus the post is treated as any other post in
                    the world . I fear that the White House will feel obliged to give the assignment
                    to a “favorite Catholic” who has helped with the election of the President. This
                    is so unfair and such a waste of a valid diplomatic post which has so much to
                    offer our nation in furthering our “national interests abroad”.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>Diplomatic relations between our two nations seem to be here to stay. The
                    situation has not endangered our Constitution or the international operations of
                    the Catholic Church.It is a most delicate post - and the person directing our
                    relations there in Rome should be fully aware of this fact. There is a large
                    gray area of our responsibilities: for example our Embassy never should become
                    involved in internal Church matters. Our political reporting on Liberation
                    Theology was, for me, one of these shady areas - where Washington viewed it as a
                    plan of social change in Third Country nations while the Vatican saw it is an
                    application of faith and social action which - in some instances - got out of
                    hand. I am sure you recall the problems in Central and Latin America which began
                    with priests and nuns organizing themselves into what were called “base
                    communities”. These groups were direct targets of right wing governments that
                    viewed them as subversives,</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a backup? All embassies had backups in the State
                        Department. You had a “country desk”? A Vatican desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, yes, we had a “Vatican Desk Officer” at the State Department who was
                    very good at his job. He was a focal point in Washington for our Embassy;
                    coordinated policy papers; communications between various Washington agencies of
                    government and assisted with visits from officials in Washington -
                    Congressional, White House, State. Whenever we had visitors to Rome, a very
                    difficult logistical situation was created. This was especially true when the
                    President, Vice President, Secretary of State or other high ranking government
                    official was involved. The problem was simply the fact that the visitors wanted
                    to call on Italian government officials - as well as the Pope - thus involving
                    very close coordination and cooperation between the two U. S. Embassies in Rome
                    as well as the Vatican and Italian Foreign Office. The Italian government was
                    quite used to this logistical problem - but it drove us and some of our
                    colleagues at Embassy Rome mad!! Of course, Advance Teams from the White House
                    NEVER understood this problem. The main difficulty was in pinning down the
                    Prefect of the Apostolic Palace to set a time - and even date sometimes - for a
                    Papal audience. Sometimes we received a confirmation the very day before an
                    official visit!! You can imagine, Bill, how this threw the “Italian program”
                    into confusion!! Official Italian calls had to be rescheduled, - so did
                    luncheons and dinners and receptions; motorcades had to be re-routed through the
                    streets of Rome! Admittedly, the Pope is one man, there is no Vice Pope! Since
                    there were, at the time, 120 embassies to the Vatican, the problem was
                    monumental! All these nations had Presidents, Ministers and Legislators - all of
                    whom wanted to be received by the Pope. You can be assured that ours was not the
                    only embassy having similar scheduling problems! We were always most relieved
                    when our official party left Rome!!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there is a Secretary of State at the Vatican or
                        someone who deals with foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes there is. This would be the position of “Cardinal Secretary of State”
                    who functions as the Papal Prime Minister. Cardinal Agostino Casaroli held the
                    position the entire time I served at the Vatican. Then - as I have previously
                    mentioned - there is an archbishop whose position equates to that of our
                    Secretary of State - or Foreign Minister. During my service there, the “Foreign
                    Minister” was Archbishop Achille Silvestrini - a very pleasant and competent man
                    who is today (1996) holds the position of Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation
                    for the Oriental Church.</p>

                        they all “embassies”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: All of the diplomatic missions accredited to the Holy See are all
                    Embassies these days. The last “Legation” was that of the United Kingdom - but
                    that mission was raised to embassy status over ten years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they had someone that they are told to deal with. This
                        is - your office contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: An interesting point, Bill, When I first started to be introduced to
                    various officials in the Vatican, I discovered that most of my official work was
                    with the officers (all priests...no lay persons!) within specific section of the
                    Secretariat of State - which deals with foreign governments. On almost a daily
                    basis I would visit the offices of the Secretariat regarding mainly political
                    matters involving our direct or indirect interests - throughout the world. These
                    offices were located on the third floor (Loggia) of the Papal Palace (Palazzo
                    Apostolico) - a truly magnificent building with over 1,000 rooms built
                    throughout the ages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is in the Vatican City itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes..and is located to the right of Bernini's colonnade in St. Peter'
                    Square - within the confines of the State of Vatican City. The entrance to the
                    Secretariat of State offices is located within the Papal Palace and decorated
                    with frescoes of Raffaello, Michelangelo and other noted artists. What a place
                    to work! It must be the most beautiful office building in the entire world! The
                    Vatican has “American Desk Officers” just as we do in the State Department.
                    These men (they are always men - and priests, as I mentioned previously!) are
                    usually responsible for more than one country. The Vatican diplomatic corps is
                    quite small - no more than 200 clerics in total. They are, as a general rule,
                    quite expert at their jobs - but, like in any country, once in a while you do
                    find a dud! I remember, for example, that the American Desk Officer during my
                    time in Rome knew very little about the United States. In addition, he spoke not
                    a word of English! In order to further his education - and help him do a better
                    job - I offered him a USIS International Visitor's Program grant which would
                    have allowed him to travel with an interpreter throughout the USA for a six week
                    period. He refused the offer - saying that “ That would be impossible as I must
                    to spend my vacation with “mia Mama!”. When I told Archbishop Silvestrini, his
                    boss, his reaction to my offer, Silvestrini rolled his eyes and said “ What can
                    we do!!”. I know that the Pro-Nuncio in Washington - Archbishop (now Cardinal)
                    Pio Laghi - never utilized this desk officer for much!</p>
                <p>Communications within the Vatican - and from the Nunciatures abroad - is
                    remarkable. I was always amazed at the detail information regarding complex
                    political situations which was known within the Vatican. Their communications,
                    however, are certainly not as speedy as ours. In fact, on several occasions - in
                    matters involving the life or death in certain countries - I authorized the
                    sending of Vatican communications through our system - resulting in the saving
                    of several lives. To have relied on the Vatican communication system would have
                    resulted in disaster on several occasions. In effect, the Vatican utilizes the
                    local postal system - sending their official classified correspondence in the
                    old-fashioned five-letter groupings and in Latin - to be decoded at the local
                    Nunciature!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could call the Vatican's Department of State and tell
                        them that our Under Secretary for Political Affairs - Armacost - is coming
                        to Rome and here's what he would like to do....... and a program
                        evolved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. We would propose a program to Washington and have it approved.
                    Then we would attempt to arrange the program at the Vatican - and not just with
                    the Secretariat of State but with any of the several international offices
                    connected directly with the Vatican - or with some religious congregation - i.e.
                    Jesuits, Benedictines, Dominicans, Oblates, etc. High ranking visits from
                    Washington were always more complicated to plan. These always involved the
                    sending of an initial Diplomatic Note explaining the President of the United
                    States (for example) was coming to Italy and would like to be received by the
                    Holy Father and the Cardinal Secretary of State. The Vatican protocol office
                    always insisted in knowing what “kind” of visit it would be: we never had a
                    “State Visit” during my time at the Vatican but simple “working visits”. (The
                    difference is minor - but a State Visit at the Vatican involves much more
                    protocol- including a meeting between the Chief of State with the entire
                    diplomatic corps in full dress as well as a return call on the visiting Chief of
                    State by the Cardinal Secretary of State to his “temporary residence in Rome” -
                    - and this means NOT the residence of his ambassador to the Italian
                    Republic.!!)</p>
                <p>Prior to a Presidential or Vice Presidential visit - of course - the famous
                    Advance Teams arrived in Rome - and wanted to examine every square inch of
                    ground that the illustrious visitor would visit. The major sticking point for me
                    was the fact that the Secret Service and security officers always wanted to view
                    the Papal Library - where the actual meeting would take place. The Vatican,
                    naturally , refused such a request stating it was the Pope's personal office and
                    was always in use. The disagreements over this refusal were, at times, fierce!!
                    The Secret Service never did manage to visit the Papal Library prior to a
                    Presidential visit - but this certainly was not for lack of trying!! In
                    arranging a high level visit to the Vatican, we would also have to deal with the
                    Regent of the Papal Palace, named Archbishop (now Cardinal) Dino Monduzzi. This
                    gentleman was responsible for every moment of the Papal daily schedule. He
                    served, in effect, as sort a Papal bouncer! Monduzzi arranged all Papal
                    audiences and ceremonies in which the pontiff participated. He also accompanied
                    the Pope on his travels throughout the world - and all this without speaking a
                    single word of a foreign language!! Monduzzi was a real character - with whom I
                    enjoyed working very much! He could be tough as nails - but was really great
                    person once you got to know him. In complex situations during an official visit,
                    his language (always in Italian!) was sometimes beyond belief for a high
                    official of the Papal Household! I got on well with him and consider him a good
                    friend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These officials are all Italians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: They were mostly Italians within the immediate entourage of the Pope —
                    but, of course, there were some Poles as well......members of the Polish “Mafia”
                    at the Vatican - as they were known.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Archbishop Monduzzi was all powerful within the Vatican. He is the keeper of the
                    papal door, the papal schedule - and his word is finaHe would direct all the
                    State visits. You can just imagine the problem he experiences with scheduling
                    the Pope's day! There is only one Pope - and every President, King, Prince,
                    Prime Minister, Cabinet Minister in the world asks to be received at the Vatican
                    when passing through Rome.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Pope John Paul II. His full title, for the record, is: Bishop of
                    Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Sovereign
                    Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the West, Primate of Italy,
                    Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Province of Rome, Sovereign of the State of
                    Vatican City - Servant of the Servants of God. Karol Wojtyla; born in Wadowice
                    (Krakow), Poland on May 18, 1920.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But a lot of your scheduling of people and all that you go
                        through that you have just described - - didn't necessarily involve the
                        Pope. Not everyone saw the Pope, did they?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No - not at all. Let's go back to Mike Armacost's visits for a moment -
                    in August of 1984, shortly after my arrival in Rome.Armacost did not actually
                    see the Pope during his visit to Rome. He came to Rome in the month of August -
                    when the Pope is traditionally in residence at his summer villa at Castel
                    Gandolfo. This Papal retreat - some 25 miles southwest of Rome - is located in
                    the mountains, near Lake Albano. The property is considered extra-territorial by
                    the Italian government under the terms of the 1929 Lateran Treaties - as are
                    several large buildings within the city of Rome which house Vatican offices. It
                    is really quite necessary for the Pope - or anyone, for that matter! - to leave
                    the city of Rome during part of the hot summer months because weather is so
                    oppressive. While at Castel Gandolfo the Pope does not normally receive
                    political figures in Audience during his summer “break”. The Holy Father usually
                    remains in residence at his villa from July through September each year. It is
                    interesting to note that Castel Gandolfo comprises an area approximately four
                    times the territory of the Vatican City itself! The property includes not only
                    the Papal villa but a world-renowned Observatory operated by the Jesuits; a
                    large experimental farm - with cattle from the King Ranch in Texas. The milk and
                    cheese produced at this farm are sold in the Vatican Commissary within Vatican
                    City to which diplomats are admitted. Its world renowned formal gardens
                    overlooking beautiful Lake Albano as well as another large separate villa and
                    extensive Roman ruins are also included in the property. It was at Castel
                    Gandolfo that Pius XII housed thousands of Italian Jews during the closing
                    months of World War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Back to our story - when Under Secretary for Political Affairs Michael Armacost
                    visited in August, he was received at the Vatican by the Secretary of State,
                    Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, as well as by the Foreign Minister, Archbishop
                    Achille Silvestrini. The meetings, which I attended with Mr. Armacost, were a
                    revelation to me as they were my first real experience in dealing with the
                    Vatican as an American diplomat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we could use this visit as sort of an example of
                        your four years, although you had many other, obviously maybe more dramatic
                        ones, but the subjects of the things you discussed and reported to
                        Washington. This would be of interest to any reader - don't you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Sure, Bill. Most definitely. The Philippines, as one would imagine, was a
                    major subject of discussion during our meetings. The timing of this visit was
                    prior to the so-calle“re-election” of President Fernando Marcos of the
                    Philippines. Tension was building in the country. The presidential electoral
                    period was about to begin and opposition to Marcos was growing daily. There was
                    division within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in the Philippines; some
                    bishops were Marcos supporters and others violently against him. As you are
                    aware, the Catholic Church has great influence in the Philippines due to the
                    fact that most Filipinos are nominally Roman Catholic. The Marcos government,
                    and especially the wife of the President, Imelda Marcos, had aligned itself with
                    various members of the hierarchy, the Catholic hierarchy, in the Philippines.
                    For this reason, there was division within the Episcopal Conference - the
                    conference of the Catholic bishops of the Philippines. More than half of them
                    were supporting the Marcos regime, and others were opposed to the re-election of
                    Marcos to the presidency. Armacost was most interested in the subject of the
                    Philippines as his last assignment was as our Ambassador in Manila.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This type of open, democratic division among bishop ,
                        which some of us looking at the Vatican don't always see as readily as we
                        see in other governments, does in fact exist?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>MURPHY: It certainly does exist and Cardinal Casaroli explained it to Armacost in
                    a very concise manner. Several books have been written about Cardinal Casaroli
                    and his years of service to the Holy See. The cardinal is a Vatican diplomat par
                    excellence. One must read between the lines of every sentence he utters.
                    Casaroli has often been called “Eminienza Prudenza” - simply because he never
                    wants to commit himself to any one position. He gave Armacost a very good
                    picture of the situation in the Philippines and of the difficulties that the
                    Vatican saw in trying to deal with Marcos, his wife - and the bishops of that
                    nation. Although Casaroli's the criticism of Marcos was implied - it was never
                    direct. When we met with (Foreign Minister) Archbishop Silvestrini, he was a bit
                    more concrete in his statements about the situation. He was a younger man, and
                    he was much more blunt in his criticism of the Marcos government and especially
                    of some of the military leaders. We also discussed the Middle East - especially
                    the situation in Lebanon and received valuable information passed to the Vatican
                    by the Syrian ambassador. The direct effects of Liberation Theology on
                    right-wing Latin American governments was also a subject of our conversation.
                    Nicaragua - and its Sandinista government, of course, was discussed in detail as
                    it was such a hot topic in those days.</p>
                <p>Following our visit to the Secretariat, I had the opportunity of having a long
                    talk with Mr. Armacost. He was really fascinated with the potential of our small
                    mission for gathering intelligence on situations around the world. He was
                    impressed by the Vatican's intimate knowledge of what was going on in Manila.
                    From his service in that country, he knew the Papal Nuncio in Manila very well
                    and he was intimately familiar with the entire political situation. He sized up
                    the Nuncio as a strong backer of Marcos (which later proved to be exact) and
                    knew that the reports coming to the Vatican from the Nuncio were all very
                    pro-Marcos in tone. However, the Vatican depends not only on its diplomats - who
                    are very few in the world - but also on other sources of information within a
                    country - including local bishops and lay leaders as well as missionaries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many Vatican diplomats are here in Washington, for
                        example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Here in Washington at the moment there are four official Vatican
                    diplomats plus a local staff of Americans working in the Papal Nunciature on
                    Massachusetts Avenue - just across from the Vice President's Residence.
                    Washington is one of the largest - and most active - Papal Nunciatures in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is small by our standards!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Relatively, Bill. All Vatican missions are small but I should think that,
                    because of the size of the Church in the United States as well as the position
                    of the USA in the world, this is the reason their mission is one of their
                    largest. Within the Nunciature in Washington, I would estimate that are about 35
                    people.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, again, your responsibility in Rome was like that of
                        all our embassies....just basically to inform the home office, in this case
                        the Vatican, what's going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. The Vatican has, in addition to its Nunciatures abroad, a
                    great resource which we don't have and which no other secular government I know
                    has as a resource. Within the set-up in Rome, there exists various
                    “Congregations” - which we could equate to ministries. Most off these have to do
                    with the daily operation of the church - Clergy, Oriental Churches, Sacraments,
                    Religious, Saints, etc.</p>
                <p>There is, for example, a Congregation titled “Propaganda Fide,” or the
                    “Propagation of the Faith”. This large office supervises all the missionary
                    activity of the Church world-wide. It is headquartered in Piazza di Spagna in
                    Rome - just next to the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See. Within this
                    Congregation worked some 300 men and women. The Congregation is divided into
                    “country desks” - similar to our State Department “desks” - but Propaganda Fide
                    only concentrates only on the Third World - the non-Christian missionary lands.
                    This arm of the Vatican deals simply with the evangelization of undeveloped - or
                    non-Christianized - lands.</p>
                <p>At this point I believe I should point out the difference between the “Foreign
                    Policy” of the Holy See - and our own “Foreign Policy”. All diplomats - of no
                    matter what nation - are aware of the fact that every government has its own
                    particular national interests. What are those of the Vatican? How can this tiny
                    State have interests - similar to those of China, Korea...or the United States
                    of America?? The Holy See's national interests are indeed quite unique in
                    today's world. The Holy See's “raison d'etre”is entirely spiritual - the spread
                    of the Gospel of Jesus Christ! The Holy See has no materialistic national
                    interests: the Vatican simply wishes to spread the message of Christ's peace and
                    love throughout the globe. In doing so - it must sometimes use methods akin to
                    those used by “normal” States. A main player in the Vatican's national interests
                    is via the work of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide.</p>
                <p>The information gathered by these missionaries who work for and report to
                    Propaganda Fide is absolutely mind-boggling. For a foreign diplomat, it is
                    without a doubt a gold mine of information! I, for example, would visit the
                    Congregation frequently and discuss local situations - say - with the cleric
                    responsible for affairs in Angola. In a few moments, I would have the latest
                    information on what the missionaries located out in the boondocks of Angola had
                    reported back to the Rome. Such information, as you can well imagine Bill, was
                    invaluable at the time - when we had no diplomatic relations with Angola - and a
                    Civil War was in progress. I received valuable information on several other
                    areas of the world - where we were lacking such information.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Such extraordinary information was to be found not only at Propaganda Fide but
                    also, for example, at the Congregation for the Oriental Church - which
                    supervised the Eastern churches - as opposed to the more familiar Latin Church.
                    These churches were based mainly in the Middle East - Lebanon, Libya, Syria,
                    Egypt as well as in India (the Siro-Malabar rite). Others of these Churches were
                    in Ukraine, northern Poland and in Russia. These offices held updated
                    information which often touched on political situations in the volatile Middle
                    East - or Eastern Europe.....at a time when Communism was about to fail in that
                    part of the world. Cuba, too, was also a frequent subject of our
                    conversations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These Eastern Catholics have a religious allegiance to the
                        Rome versus Constantinople or other popes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. They are distinct from the Orthodox Church where the
                    nominal head is the Patriarch in Istanbul. These Eastern Catholic Churches are
                    in full communion with Rome. The Church I worked most closely with while I was
                    in Rome was with the Ukrainian Church. For years under Communism there was a
                    very active underground Catholic Church in Ukraine. All of the clergy and
                    hierarchy of that church fell under the authority of the Congregation of the
                    Oriental Church in Rome. I tell you all this, Bill, just to give you a flavor of
                    the vast resources for valuable information available in Rome - but involving
                    peoples and societies around the globe. I should note other valuable sources of
                    information for our Embassy - which are in no way connected with the Vatican's
                    Secretariat of State. These would be the various religious congregations (male
                    and female) based in Rome: the Jesuits, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the
                    Benedictines, the White Fathers of Africa, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the
                    Passionists, the Trappists, the Divine Word Missionaries, the Maryknoll priests,
                    the Christian Brothers and several others. All of these religious orders have
                    headquarters in Rome - and in each headquarters there are clerics responsible
                    for following the daily activity of their members worldwide. The information
                    available in Rome is massive - if only you have the time to cultivate the direct
                    sources! It was most difficult for our small mission to keep up with all the
                    work. In point of fact, our political reporting (judged by cable traffic) to
                    Washington far exceeded in volume that of the Embassy to the Republic of Italy
                    and the constituent posts around the country!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, let me interrupt this by confirming something. You,
                        as an American diplomat, were one of our rarely assigned officers - sent to
                        a very special type of diplomatic mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right - as I've mentioned before, it was a very special kind of an
                    assignment! I think that you can tell that by what I have related thus far.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vatican practically doesn't exist in any other form.
                        We have country-to-country relationships. We are, as diplomats, trained to
                        “do things”. But what you brought up here, I think, is of particular
                        interest, Peter. Not only is it all of that, something quite unique, that
                        you are describing to us, but we probably have no other “oral history”
                        relating to our relations with the Vatican and all that it means. We still
                        have a few stories left, I'm sure, but explicitly - other sources of
                        information from the host government? For example, the Embassy in Rome has
                        all kinds of people pouring through its doors. It has things that come in
                        through the consular route. It has things that come in through the business
                        route. It has power pressures of all sorts that had their voices from the
                        United States coming in through the Embassy in Rome, and expressing
                        themselves, influencing, whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In the Vatican, they have theirs too - I presume. They happen to be a different
                    set. For example, you've mentioned the Orders, the ecclesiastical structure,
                    even some rather esoteric-named groups. The Episcopal Conference of Bishops, for
                    example, the American...?</p>
                <p>MURPHY: The United States Conference of Bishops. It is a grouping of all Catholic
                    bishops of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. That is a source of information, independent of
                        your mission, independent of our mission to the Vatican, that is supplying
                        all kinds of information, political perhaps although basically
                        ecclesiastical. How did you, for example, deal with some of these other
                        sources from the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's a very interesting point, Bill, ....as well as a very delicate
                    point.</p>
                <p>I mentioned at the beginning of this interview that this mission was unique and
                    also that I found for the first year of my stay in Rome much opposition to the
                    mission from the American public (in the form of crank letters!) as well as from
                    various offices in Washington. You well remember the outcry in our nation back
                    in the late ''50s when President Harry Truman proposed General Mark C. Clark
                    (known in Italy as the Liberator of Rome) as Ambassador to the Vatican! I
                    believe I am correct in saying that this was in the mid or late '50s. So great-
                    and immediate - was the public opposition, that Truman was obliged to rescind
                    his nomination within a few short weeks of its announcement. It was never
                    presented to the Congress for confirmation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't just Protestant, Catholic or anything? It was a
                        true feeling that....</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, I'm not so sure of that, Bill. I believe that the main opposition
                    was mainly inspired by fundamental Protestantism - of the Paul Blanchard variety
                    or the organization entitled Americans United for the Separation of Church and
                    State. There was a bias in the nation, to be sure - but the fact must be faced
                    that serious minded Constitutional scholars have believed that such a move on
                    the part of our government was indeed a violation of the separation of Church
                    and State - - i.e. the recognition of one religion over another - as well as
                    touching on the matter of the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Congress
                    at the time was in no mood to approve sending an Ambassador to the Holy See at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what I meant. It was religious perhaps, as well,
                        but....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: When, in 1984, President Ronald Reagan decided to open our new Embassy,
                    the various opposing organizations - such as the Americans United for the
                    Separation of Church and State and various Southern Baptist organizations
                    testified before the Congressional committees explaining their opposition to
                    this new diplomatic tie with the Holy See. The opposition was not entirely from
                    the part of non-Catholics. Believe it or not, it also came from some Catholic
                    bishops. I recall vividly at a reception which included various American bishops
                    on their “ad limina” (”to the thresh- hold” - i.e. to the thresh-hold of St.
                    Peter's tomb in Rome) visits to Rome which all Catholic bishops are required to
                    make to Rome every five years. An American bishop from the Mid-West came up to
                    me and said, “Would you tell me what you people are doing here? Why don't you
                    close up your shop and go home? You're interfering with the communications
                    between the American hierarchy and the Vatican.” In addition to thinking him
                    extremely rude, I thought that there must be many people like him in the United
                    States who think that the Embassy is there in Rome to somehow influence the
                    Vatican in its dealings with the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. I
                    assure you, Bill that nothing could be further from the truth!! During my four
                    plus years of service at the Vatican, several topics were always out of bounds
                    for discussion between officials of the Vatican and our Embassy. Sometimes the
                    line is quite fine: During the Reagan years, when we at the Embassy were
                    attempting to convince the Vatican on the necessity of somehow coming out with a
                    public statement approving our Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) - we had to be
                    very careful not to appear to be lobbying the Vatican against the Peace Pastoral
                    being written by the American Bishops Conference at the time. Caution had to be
                    exercised that no member of our staff criticized to the Vatican the actions of
                    any American citizen - Cardinal or layman. As a result, the entire Embassy staff
                    was very, very careful in our relationships with members of the American
                    hierarchy - both those in the United States as well as those stationed at the
                    Vatican itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is your time, Peter : this wasn't at Harry Truman's
                        time? This was thirty years later?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. I'd like now, Bill, to quote something which would be most
                    appropriate to include in this historic recording. Before arriving at the
                    Vatican, I received firm instructions from Washington which were similar to
                    those given to all diplomats before coming to Rome at the time of the existence
                    of our Legation to the Papal States The original of these instructions was
                    provided to my predecessors by President James K. Polk. They were directives
                    that were actually written to the first United States Minister to the Holy See
                    in about 1845.</p>
                <p>“There is one consideration which you ought always to keep in view in your
                    intercourse with the Papal authorities. All denominations of Christians stand on
                    the same footing in this country, and every man enjoys the inestimable right of
                    worshiping his God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Your
                    efforts, therefore, will be devoted exclusively to the cultivation of the most
                    friendly civil relations with the Papal government. You will carefully avoid
                    even the appearance of interfering with ecclesiastical questions whether these
                    relate to the United States or any other church of the world. It might be proper
                    to make these views known on some suitable occasion to the Papal government so
                    that there may be no mistake or misunderstanding on this subject.”</p>
                <p>And I can assure, Bill, that all officers assigned to the American Embassy to the
                    Holy See follow these directives scrupulously. Upon the arrival of a new officer
                    at post, I made it a point to review the perimeters of our mission. I believe
                    that this gives you the flavor of our Embassy at the Holy See - is quite unique,
                    to say the least!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any kind of explicit guidelines.........if
                        that's the way to put it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>MURPHY: In all honesty, no, Bill, but I made the guidelines. I directed all
                    officers assigned to the Holy See to read what President Polk had directed years
                    earlier because I felt that such an admonition was still valid today. Many of
                    our colleagues within the State Department, and in the CIA, NSC, the White
                    House, etc., were opposed to our being in Rome. I would constantly receive calls
                    of complaint from the public as well as a few from “official Washington”. In
                    spite of the fact that we were a very small mission, I was in constant telephone
                    and cable contact with Washington. I found it interesting that in a telephonic
                    conversation with State, USIA, NSC - or whoever - within the first two or three
                    minutes, I could tell whether my interlocutor was in favor of this Mission or
                    completely opposed to its existence. In the early days of my stay, I received
                    several Congressional Delegations. Addressing them, I almost felt like the State
                    Department spokesman in defending the reasons for our being there, and
                    explaining that “No, we did not interfere with the appointment of bishops in the
                    United States”. nor did we interfere with the Congregation of Bishops in their
                    selection of men, American clerics, to become bishops of various dioceses, or
                    indeed recommend those to be nominated to receive the red hat of the Cardinal!
                    Within the first couple of months of my arrival, I remember addressing a huge
                    (over 130 people) Congressional delegation - in St. Peter's Square - prior to a
                    Papal audience!! Several of the above questions arose during this briefing - -
                    held outdoors since our small Chancery at the time was not large enough to
                    receive all the delegation members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Department of State got similar queries and could
                        answer them the same way that you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh yes, they did...and rather frequently at that - particularly in
                    1984-85.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One more question going back to the American connection of
                        the Church, the Conference of American Bishops. Did you get flack from
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Once in a while we would. Objections came mostly from bishops from the
                    backwoods - Middle America - who had little understanding of the true purpose of
                    our Embassy. These men even had difficulty understanding the whole set-up at the
                    Vatican itself!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Vatican should have been able to handle that. They
                        should control their bishops.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Bill - most of these American bishops - especially the ones who had never
                    studied in Rome as young men - had no idea, not a clue, as to how the Vatican
                    functioned. They were just like an ordinary American in the street. The Vatican
                    is indeed a very complex organization (....some would use another term -
                    Machiavellian !) and rather difficult for the ordinary person to understand.
                    There is history - and precedent - attached to the most minute problem or
                    question. The Church has its own way of doing things. As history has proved, it
                    is not always correct in its decisions - see Galileo Gallilei!!To confuse
                    everyone even more: the official diplomatic language of the Vatican is - - not
                    Latin - - and not Italian - but French! Every Diplomatic Note we received was
                    written in French. In addition, our daily work was conducted with Vatican
                    officials of all nationalities; French, British, Irish, Italians, Japanese,
                    Poles, Indians, priests from Latin America and Asia. I would say that to be most
                    effective at the Vatican one should be conversant in, at a minimum, French,
                    Spanish and Italian.</p>
                <p>Q:What about their official diplomatic communications between “posts”. :
                    MURPHY:The Vatican's communications, their One Time Pad, utilizes the Latin
                    language. All of the messages are in Latin. It's unbelievable, but I have had
                    confirmation that sensitive messages - which are sent in code - are in Latin to
                    this day!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's like sending it in Navajo, because nobody can read
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Let me quote one of our dear American priests, and I'm sure you've heard of
                    Father Andrew Greeley, who is a sociologist and writes very interesting
                    materials. To quote from his book, which I enjoyed very much, is that “American
                    Catholics are devout Catholics despite the Catholic Church.” There is an
                    independence — the American spirit perhaps. Like the bishop out in Iowa or
                    wherever he was - is maybe more American than he is understanding of his own
                    Church.</p>
                <p>MURPHY: Bill, that's one point I should comment on. Our fellow Americans'
                    practice of Catholicism was a subject I had to deal with great care on an almost
                    daily basis...so I am quite attuned to the pitfalls! In Rome I frequently met
                    American priests, laymen, noted political figures who brought up the subject of
                    the Catholic Church in the United States. I would be obliged to gently redirect
                    the conversation. Why - I recall, at the end of a Private Audience regarding
                    sensitive political matters, one distinguished American General started telling
                    the Pope about the terrible pastor he had in his parish in the Northern Virginia
                    area!! I was aghast...but the Pope took it in stride, telling him not to
                    worry....the priest couldn't last forever! Another time I recall a Cabinet
                    member asking how I could go about facilitating the issuance of an annulment of
                    her marriage in the Sacred Roman Rota - the Vatican's marriage tribunal! I let
                    this lady know in no uncertain terms that such matters were far from the scope
                    of our mission at the Vatican and that her local bishop back home would be the
                    person to contact in this matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, back to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>MURPHY: To continue, Bill, on the same theme: one of the most delicate tasks we
                    had was in our dealings with the American clerics assigned to the Holy See. The
                    highest ranking was William Cardinal Baum, the former Cardinal Archbishop of
                    Washington, DC, who was at that time the Prefect of the Congregation for
                    Catholic Education - meaning his office had jurisdiction over Catholic education
                    throughout the world - from kindergarten through university. (I am not sure how
                    many Catholic educational institutions actually followed the directives of the
                    Congregation, however!). There were other clerics, for example, Archbishop
                    Justin Rigali, (present Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri) who was President of
                    the Pontifical Diplomatic Academy. Justin was the first American to hold this
                    distinguished position. Msgr. James Harvey was the head of the English Language
                    Section of the Secretariat of State - i.e. he was responsible for all of the
                    Holy Father's addresses in English, including those made in his journeys around
                    the world plus any written materials signed by the Pope. He is now (1998)
                    Prefect of the Apostolic Palace - and perhaps the most influential American
                    stationed at the Vatican.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there were Americans as your counterparts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's correct..... Americans who were working for a foreign government
                    (The Holy See) to which I was accredited. My relations with them were naturally
                    very friendly. These men were most helpful and they fully understood the mission
                    of our Embassy. I had to be constantly on guard in dealing with these men -
                    because of the double-loyalty conflict! This was especially true when dealing
                    with clerics assigned within the Secretariat of State (Foreign Office) - where,
                    they say, all employees are bound by an oath of secrecy!! All of us at the
                    Embassy had to be very circumspect in dealing with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not unlike, perhaps, Americans assigned to the United
                        Nations Secretariat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They're American, BUT....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - - BUT!.... However, I am very grateful to many of them as several
                    of these men really did help me a lot in establishing the Embassy in the early
                    years. I can, however, think of a few who were pains in the ass!</p>
                <p>As you can well imagine, Bill, if I had a problem at the Vatican, I really
                    couldn't call anyone at State to ask for advice! No one before me had
                    experienced such an assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were welcomed by these people at the Vatican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Jackie and I were made most welcome. I had known Cardinal William
                    Wakefield Baum - the former Cardinal Archbishop of Washington, DC prior to my
                    arrival in Rome. Then there was Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus of whom I am
                    certain you have read, Bill. If only time permitted, I could speak at length
                    about Archbishop Marcinkus - a man much maligned in the Vatican and by the world
                    press. He is truly a good person - and I do not believe for one moment that he
                    was guilty of any underhanded operations at the Vatican Bank. In sum - he was
                    placed in a job by his friend, Pope Paul VI , which was out of his competence as
                    a cleric. I am positive that the Pope did not have any idea of the complexities
                    of the position either. So often this is the case with clerics: they understand
                    nothing of money - expect how to spend and collect it!! I got to know all these
                    people assigned to the Vatican very well. I must mention Msgr. (now Bishop)
                    William Murphy of Boston. Bill is a very close friend and was at the Vatican for
                    years in the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.In addition he was the
                    Rector of Villa Stritch - the residence for American priests working at the
                    Vatican. On more than one occasion, Bill was extremely helpful to our Embassy in
                    its fledgling days!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The financial advisor.......... But these Americans were

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Not at all. I believe that they were truly delighted their government had

                <p>MURPHY: Bill, could I go on just on to briefly outline some of the main political
                    events which occurred while I was at the Vatican. I should think that the reader
                    would be interested in some of these events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my question, exactly. Beyond the Philippines,
                        what other events occurred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I'll briefly cover the period from 1984 to 1988. This will just give you
                    a flavor of some of the important issues we dealt with on a daily basis. Our
                    work there consisted purely of diplomatic work; only political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And with the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>MURPHY: And with the world. Political and representation. That's all we did in
                    Rome. Naturally we got involved in a few consular matters, I'll mention them
                    later, but the bulk of the work was political.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did have just one exception, though, that you
                        mentioned yourself. United States Information Agency What kind of a role did
                        USIA play since it's diplomatic and representation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The reason USIA was there, as I believe I mentioned before, was because
                    of Ambassador Bill Wilson's great friendship with Mr. Charles Wick. This is the
                    noted President Reagan-Wick-Wilson combination! I met both Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wick
                    on two or three occasions. He had the well-deserved reputation of a madman while
                    his wife was charming - and quite bright. You'll remember that Charlie Wick was
                    responsible for that extravaganza “Let Poland be Poland”........ starring Frank
                    Sinatra!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wick was head of USIA at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. I did not agree when Bill Wilson wanted to establish a USIS
                    office - nor when he wanted the Embassy to provide consular services to Vatican
                    City natives! But of course - when dealing with Bill Wilson - objections did not
                    count!! He as a very determined man - who usually gets what he wants. Bill once
                    told me that a good manager never gets ulcers - he gives them!! I did manage to
                    squash the idea of consular services, after many months of discussion, - as the
                    Vatican does not accept the accreditation of consular officials. However, with
                    regard to a USIS office, I did eventually come to change my mind after seeing
                    the success of the venture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What function did it serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>MURPHY: William J. A. (Bill) Barnes, a seasoned officer and fluent Italian
                    speaker, was assigned by the United States Information Agency (USIA) from Genoa
                    to Rome. I had worked with Bill in Genoa and knew of his many fine qualities and
                    thought he would be just right for the Vatican USIS job. So Bill came to Rome a
                    few months after I was in Rome. He set up a USIS library at the office and soon
                    started establishing liaison with the nine Pontifical Universities in Rome. If
                    you can imagine, Bill, at those universities (which had never been visited by
                    anyone from USIS/Rome) there were over 27,000 students..... three-fourths of
                    whom, I would guess, come from Third World nations. These are the best and the
                    brightest in the Third World. Most are clerics..... naturally. (There are an
                    awful lot of priests and seminarians in Rome. It is no wonder the Italians have
                    a reputation for being anti-clerical - - they never see any of them work - - and
                    most look pretty well fed!!) We set up lectures of distinguished American
                    scholars and even participated in the International Visitor Program of the
                    Agency. This is, in my opinion, one of the best of all USIA's many programs: we
                    identified future leaders (in our case....leaders at the Vatican) and they
                    received a free trip to the USA to investigate whatever segment of our society
                    interested them. As you know, Bill, many world leaders have benefited by this
                    program - starting with Lady Margaret (Maggie) Thatcher - the former Prime
                    Minister of Great Britain!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the educational portion of USIA did produce.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It really did. And then....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, the press, naturally. Whenever, for example, we were pushing the
                    Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) or another major Administration initiative,
                    we relied heavily on Bill Barnes' expertise in this area. We did have quite a
                    job to attempt to “sell” SDI at the Vatican in view of the widespread opposition
                    to the expansion of military might and nuclear power even for self defense .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: SDI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, the Strategic Defense Initiative of the Reagan administration. I
                    will mention this again in a minute. But another of the most important USIS
                    functions was liaison with Vatican Radio and the Vatican's media organs. The
                    Vatican Radio broadcast 24 hours a day in 65 languages. It is reputed to be the
                    most powerful radio in the world.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: VOA aside. And our collaboration and cooperation with the Vatican radio
                    was very close. On occasion, we utilized the network to pass messages in various
                    parts of the world........humanitarian-type messages which could be passed in no
                    other manner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your man came on board and produced well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Bill Barnes is one of the best USIS officers I have ever met.</p>
                <p>Now I'll try to relate some of the political events that took place during my
                    tenure at the Vatican from 1984 to 1988. I would say on top of the list would be
                    the subject of Vatican-Israeli diplomatic relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which have been established now; the Vatican and Israel
                        have recently established relations! Your work has come to fruition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. I am really most pleased at the way things worked out. During the
                    early part of my tour in Rome, the Congress of the United States passed a Sense
                    of the Congress Resolution urging the establishment of diplomatic relations
                    between the Holy See and the state of Israel. The Vatican, of course, saw this
                    as gross interference in the internal affairs of a foreign nation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We do not hesitate!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Never! In addition, at the Embassy, we were visited quite often by
                    delegations of rabbis and prominent members of the Jewish community from the
                    United States..... leaders of the American Jewish community. Their main
                    objective was to pressure us to pressure the Holy See to open talks with Israel
                    relating to diplomatic recognition of the State of Israel. Throughout my tour, I
                    was in very close contact with the officer of the Israeli Embassy to the
                    Republic of Italy, who was assigned as the unofficial liaison between Israel and
                    the Vatican. This officer was the conduit through which the Vatican communicated
                    with the Israeli government. He was a very clever diplomat, very cultured. His
                    wife was Italian and he spoke the language fluently. He understood both the
                    political situation as well as the historical context of the difficulties of
                    Christians speaking with Jews. This was very important - - and understood by so
                    few..sometimes even within the Vatican!</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what this underscores, Peter, in spades, is the fact
                        that you represent the United States, that you and your Ambassador boss do
                        not represent the Catholic Church or Catholics, and Mr. Polk's words, even
                        though he only used the word “Christian” to talk about the religious people,
                        it included everybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. It did indeed included everybody. In my mind, Bill, the
                    establishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and the Holy See was a
                    most important event - in fact perhaps it is the most important event in
                    fostering peace and understanding among two peoples in the past 2,000 years!
                    While in Rome dealing with this question on a periodic basis, I frequently
                    thought of the reasons and origins of the Holocaust - and anti-Semitism
                    throughout the ages. The Church was often present - fostering such feelings.
                    Thus - I worked very diligently toward this end of bringing the two countries
                    together. Washington was sometimes skeptical of our motives! For example, I
                    frequently visited the Grand Rabbi in Rome - whose synagogue was visited by John
                    Paul II. (I, too, was invited to be present at this event - but as I considered
                    it a purely religious visit, declined the Rabbi's invitation. I had a hell of a
                    time convincing Ambassador Max Rabb that he should not attend the event - but,
                    in the end, was successful!)</p>
                <p>Vatican- Israeli diplomatic relations were, I felt, more than a relationship
                    between two foreign countries. I felt that this was truly a relationship between
                    peoples clouded by a 2000 year history of animosity against Jewish people in
                    Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and throughout the world, in fact.The times have
                    changed - thank God! At Second Vatican Council, which now is celebrating its
                    twenty-fifth anniversary, this question was at last addressed directly by the
                    Roman Catholic Church. You'll recall that in the forefront of this debate were
                    several distinguished American theologians - John Courtney Murray, Avery Dulles,
                    S.J., etc</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>I believe that today we see the fruit of a lot of hard work in the recognition of
                    the state of Israel by the Holy See. During my time in Rome, this was a very
                    contentious problem. People at the Vatican often did want to speak of the
                    subject openly. The situation was complicated by the fact that we had people of
                    all nationalities in official positions within the Vatican........... foreigners
                    of all sorts,- - Poles, British, Irish, Japanese, Indians, Americans, Italians,
                    French. They all arrived with their political and cultural baggage. You cannot
                    divorce one from the other, as you well know, Bill. A good case in point
                    follows: One fine Roman morning about 10:30 Bill Wilson and I went to the
                    Palazzo San Carlo inside Vatican City to meet with a very close personal friend
                    of the Pope, Andrzej Cardinal Deskur. Cardinal Deskur is a Pole who had been the
                    first President of the Council for Social Communications after its establishment
                    early on in the reign of John Paul II. (The Vatican was indeed rushing in the
                    21st Century with the establishment of such an office ! If you can imagine, Bill
                    - this office was the very first Vatican office which was specifically charged
                    with press and media relations!) Deskur was forcibly retired from that position
                    in the early ''80s when he suffered a stroke and was confined to a wheelchair.
                    He continued to live in his Vatican apartment. His handicap did not prevent him,
                    however, from participating in Papal ceremonies or from visiting with the Pope
                    frequently. Deskur, a very intelligent and distinguished gentleman, was a
                    descendent of a French family which had lived in Poland for several generations.
                    Our purpose in visiting the cardinal was to discuss the political situation in
                    Poland and the rise of the independent labor union , Solidarity. Not long into
                    the conversation, the Cardinal turned to the subject of Israel - and the debate
                    over the diplomatic recognition of Israel by the Holy See. Cardinal Deskur
                    insisted that it was “the Italian clerical Mafia” who were against establishing
                    diplomatic ties. He claimed that the Holy Father and all Poles - in the Vatican,
                    at least - wanted to extend such diplomatic recognition - but the Italians
                    (presumably in the Secretariat of State) had been holding it up for years.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of our hour-long discussion, the Cardinal served coffee and a
                    lovely Polish cake - which, he told us, was left over from the previous
                    evening's dinner with the Holy Father. (This fact proved rather important - -
                    later!) It had been baked by the Polish nuns who cared for the Papal Apartments.
                    It was well known around Rome that Cardinal Deskur dined with the Pope at least
                    once a week. I guess that he had just decided to bring home a “doggie bag” from
                    his dinner the previous evening!</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>At soon as we returned to the Embassy from our meeting at the Vatican, we
                    naturally sent a full report of our conversation to Washington. Unbelievably, my
                    reporting telegram was leaked to the press - in spite of its classification!
                    (NOTE Action Secstate and INFO Tel Aviv) I was getting ready to go to a formal
                    dinner that same evening, I was called by the State Department director of
                    European Affairs and told that Marvin Kalb, a TV journalist, was about to quote
                    from my telegram on the evening national television news. In addition, the
                    Department had learned that Kalb intended to state that Bill Wilson and I had
                    been formally instructed by both the White House and State Department to
                    President Reagan to push the subject of Israeli recognition at every available
                    opportunity - and especially with Cardinal Deskur! You can imagine our reaction!
                    The evening ended at the Ambassador's residence with both of us on one line
                    speaking with the White House spokesman Ronald Speakes. Much to my discomfort,
                    it was decided that I should be the one - as author of the subject telegram - to
                    call Mr. Kalb just prior to air time in NYC and dissuade him from reading our
                    cable on national television.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Passing the buck?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly! So — I called New York - and in no time had Mr. Kalb on the
                    line. (It's always amazing to me how fast the communications in - or through -
                    the White House communications facilities work!.) Kalb said, “Oh yes, Mr.
                    Murphy, I recognize your name. I have a story this evening concerning your
                    Embassy at the Vatican and the State of Israel. Yes, I'm going to read something
                    very interesting that you sent from Rome as a result of your meeting at the
                    Vatican with that Polish Cardinal.”Q: “Which I happen to have a copy of.”???</p>
                <p>MURPHY: Kalb started reading the cable and I knew positively that he had the
                    cable in hand - since the wording was mine! I told him point blank, “Look if you
                    mention that the President or the Secretary of State have instructed us push
                    this subject of diplomatic recognition of Israel at the Vatican - it will be
                    absolutely false statement. I told him that our government's position is in
                    favor of such relations and that we constantly work toward this end...but we had
                    received no specific instructions concerning the Polish cardinal - Cardinal
                    Deskur. . I added that if he made such a false statement - knowing the Vatican
                    as I do, it would perhaps have the effect of delaying any chance of diplomatic
                    recognition by 50 years! I was thankful that Kalb did not report that on the
                    air. However, he did report our meeting with the Cardinal and, of course, read
                    parts of my telegram..</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>I'll provide a fine example to the “workings and coordination of the Vatican”.
                    The following day, a Sunday, my wife and I attended Mass at the American Church
                    of Santa Susanna in downtown Rome. In the courtyard, following the Mass, coffee
                    and rolls were served. We were joined at coffee by Archbishop John J. Foley,
                    from Philadelphia, who was the head of the Office of Social Communication at the
                    Vatican - and the successor to Cardinal Deskur.Archbishop Foley was new in Rome,
                    having arrived about the time that I did. He was just learning exactly how the
                    Vatican functioned. He came up to me in the courtyard of the church, and said,
                    “Gee, Peter, it's amazing. All kinds of journalists have been calling and asking
                    about your meeting with Cardinal Deskur. And, of course, I just put out a
                    statement saying that he had never met you.” I said, “I beg your pardon?” He
                    said, “ Well - I called the Cardinal last night and he said he'd never met you
                    or Ambassador Wilson on last Wednesday at his home in Vatican City.” I said,
                    “But do you remember last week I told you about being served a Polish dessert
                    which came from the Pope's table? That was at Cardinal Deskur's home in the
                    Vatican - following the meeting Bill Wilson and I had with the Cardinal.” “Oh -
                    Yes,” said Foley, “ I do remember that now! Do you think the Cardinal actually
                    lied to me?” I told the Archbishop that I wouldn't know what you would call it
                    in Vaticanese, but I certainly did meet the Cardinal in question! This is quite
                    a good illustration of how difficult it is sometimes to work at the Vatican.
                    Admittedly - Archbishop Foley was new at the job - and was not at all at home
                    working at the Vatican! He had a lot to learn....and fast!</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. Bill - since we have been speaking a bit about Poland, perhaps
                    this is a good time to bring up the shooting of the Pope in St. Peter's Square,
                    the rise of the unions in Poland and the eventual fall of Communism.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>With the election of a Polish Pope in October of 1978, the Soviets soon realized
                    that they had a serious problem on their hands All this happened long before I
                    arrived in Rome, of course, but in the early days of my tour at the Vatican I
                    began to focus on the Kremlin's efforts of disinformation which were directed at
                    blocking the Vatican's efforts to promote human rights in area under Soviet
                    control. It was evident to us that the Soviets saw John Paul II as a direct
                    threat to their values and beliefs - and above all - their power! Their initial
                    reaction - in addition to spreading propaganda injurious to Vatican interests -
                    was to clamp down on Catholic clergy in Lithuania, Ukraine, Latvia as well as in
                    Poland and Hungary and the then Czechoslovakia. From several sources, we at the
                    Embassy noted the general hardening of the Communist authorities in the face of
                    organized religion. This was particularly evident in Ukraine. Several reports of
                    flagrant human rights violations were sent from our Embassy to Washington in
                    1984 and 1985. I also saw evidence, during this period, that the Russian
                    Orthodox Church was enlisted in the fight against Rome. This was particularly
                    noticeable in statements emanating from the Moscow Patriarchiate and from
                    Russian Orthodox delegations attending international meetings - such as the
                    World Council of Churches in Geneva. The Soviets knew, I believe, that the
                    Catholic clergy in the nations of their empire was not loyal to the communist
                    masters in the same manner that the State-supported Orthodox Church was
                    loyal.The situation was aggravated, in the eyes of the Soviets, by John Paul's
                    triumphant visits to his homeland; the gathering strength of the Solidarity
                    trade union; and especially the manner in which Lech Walesa was received by the
                    Pope at the Vatican on the three occasions he was permitted to visit Rome. Some
                    said that Walesa's reception was akin to that of a head of state. Andrie
                    Gromyko, the old Soviet war-horse Foreign Minister, had visited John XXIII, Paul
                    VI - and also John Paul II in the course of his long career. Following each of
                    his Papal audiences, the announced subjects of discussion were the inevitable
                    problems of human rights and religious freedom in areas of Soviet control.
                    Gromyko, I often heard at the Vatican, had a much more difficult time in
                    deflecting John Paul's questions than he did those of John Paul's predecessors
                    in the job! We kept a very close tab on all contacts or statements by the Holy
                    See which indicated an opening to the Soviets - or to nations in the Soviet
                    camp. For example, the visits of the Soviet Army Chorus to the Vatican; Papal
                    greetings delivered in the Russian language; Soviet university students being
                    received with other European students - but being singled out for special Papal
                    attention; visits of “roving” Soviet Ambassadors to the Secretariat of State,
                    etc. All of this activity - no matter how seemingly insignificant - was duly
                    reported to Washington.</p>
                <p>Cooperation between the U. S. government (especially the White House) and the
                    Vatican during my years in Rome was quite remarkable for its closeness and must
                    have been a most worrisome fact of political life for the Soviets. This was due
                    to several factors: the personalities of John Paul II and Ronald Reagan; United
                    States interest in human rights in general and especially in exploiting
                    Solidarity's struggle against General Wojciech Jaruzelski - the Polish leader
                    and - if I might add - the presence of a new American Embassy at the Holy See!!
                    This was concrete evidence that US-Holy See cooperation was flourishing!. I well
                    remember the joy expressed by the Pope when I informed him at Castel Gandolfo
                    that our Congress had voted the sum of Ten Million Dollars to support the
                    struggle of the Solidarity movement in his native land.</p>

                <p>Well - I suppose, Bill, that you are about to ask the $64,000 question: Who
                    ordered the shooting of the Pope? That question dominated my four years at the
                    Vatican.I can tell you honestly that I don't know. The Turkish gunman who is
                    spending the rest of his life in an Italian prison for his actions, Mehmet Ali
                    Agca, was caught in the act of attempting to assassinate John Paul II on May 13,
                    1981 in St. Peter's Square. The actual facts surrounding the attempted
                    assassination of the Pope remain a mystery to this day. I, of course, never
                    asked the Pope about this incident — but on more than one occasion I discussed
                    the shooting with his personal Polish secretary, Msgr. Stanislaw Dziwisz. One
                    conversation took place just a few days after the Pope paid Ali Agca a visit in
                    the Roman prison. You'll recall, Bill, that the Pope and the Turk met for over
                    an hour at the prison - with no one else present. The room had been de-bugged
                    prior to the meeting - at the Vatican's insistence. No statement was issued
                    after that historic meeting. The Papal secretary told me the Pope did not say
                    one word to him about the meeting - but, as soon as he returned to his study at
                    the Apostolic Palace, he wrote a detailed report in his own hand, sealed it with
                    the Papal ring - and put it in a safe. The Pope, according to Dziwisz, told him
                    that the letter should not be opened for many years. John Paul II also said: “If
                    this information were to be made public now, the economies of several nations
                    would be dramatically affected.” The Pope explained no further. We must
                    remember, Bill, the timing of this statement - 1985 - long before the fall of
                    the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism throughout Eastern Europe. As you
                    are aware, our government conducted very serious and comprehensive investigation
                    into the Papal assassination attempt, in which I played a part on several
                    occasions. Someday it will make fascinating reading!</p>
                <p>I don't believe that I should say any more about this delicate subject at this
                    time.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Perhaps I should address the relations between the Vatican and Philippines during
                    the period of my service in Rome. The most exciting time, in my view, was that
                    shortly after the fraudulent re-election of President Fernando Marcos. I believe
                    that the work accomplished by our small mission in Rome actually prevented
                    bloodshed from spilling in the streets of Manila at that time. I'll try to
                    explain. But - Bill - let me tell you that I am finding it most frustrating to
                    attempt to describe these complex political situations in which I was sometimes
                    intimately involved in ten words - - or less!! (Some day I hope to have time to
                    review all my agendas - which I have kept - and add volumes to this memoir!!)
                    Immediately following Marcos' re-election, the Philippine Bishops Conference
                    issued a letter which explicitly stated that the election was fraudulent and
                    that Marcos was no longer president of the country. Tension in Manila - and
                    throughout the nation was great. The military were put on full alert by Marcos.
                    A general strike was called throughout the country - and the streets were filled
                    with people for days. The agitation was evident and tension was building each
                    hour. Everyone was waiting to see what world opinion - and especially the
                    Vatican would say about the Bishops' action. The situation was even more
                    complicated given the fact that Marcos and his wife were so close to a number of
                    ranking churchmen in the country. The White House had sent Ambassador Phil Habib
                    to assess the situation in Manila. He spoke with all concerned parties. When
                    Phil saw that the Vatican had not given the Philippine bishops its backing, he
                    called me in Rome and asked what the hell was going on! He said that full scale
                    Civil War would break out if the people did not receive outside support soon -
                    and the best support possible would be Papal backing for the Bishops of the
                    country. “ Why hadn't the Pope said anything. The tanks were in the streets now.
                    “</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>I went immediately to the Foreign Minister, Archbishop Silvestrini, and asked why
                    the Pope had not come out in favor of the bishops. Silvestrini was obviously
                    distraught; at the end of a half hour attempting to explain the impossible, he
                    gathered his papers together and off we went together to see Cardinal Casaroli.
                    This was the one and only time I was ever present in the Secretary of State's
                    working office. Normally in the Vatican one meets in small reception rooms -
                    like in a Rectory or Vicarage at home! We found the Cardinal working at his desk
                    in his shirtsleeves ! I wish I had a camera to record his look of shock when he
                    saw me enter his office with Silvestrini! After an hour discussion, the Cardinal
                    finally admitted, “I'll tell you what our problem is. There are 112 members of
                    the Episcopal Conference in the Philippines. Thirty-six men were present when
                    this letter of condemnation was written last week. Out of the 36 who were
                    present, only 75% of the 36 voted for the letter. So how can we say that this
                    condemnation of the Marcos government is the will of the Episcopal Conference in
                    the Philippines?” I told him I fully understood the problem but - in vivid terms
                    - explained the violent civil unrest which would occur in the streets of Manila
                    if the Holy Father did not address the situation in a public and forceful manner
                    within 24 hours. The next day was Sunday. Following the traditional noontime
                    Angelus prayer from his library window in the Apostolic Palace overlooking St.
                    Peter's Square, Pope John Paul II gave a brief talk in which he fully supported
                    the bishops and the people of the Philippines “ in their hour of great need”.
                    This was a major great turning point in this volatile situation - and what I
                    consider a great success for our small Embassy at the Holy See because from that
                    day the tanks in Manila began to back down - and to return to the military
                    bases! Never in my life did I dream that I would be putting words into a Pope's
                    mouth - but there you are! And....this was not the last time I had a hand in
                    what the Pontiff had to say! I recall once having written to the Vatican
                    requesting a Papal audience for a group of NATO military officers. When we
                    gathered for the audience imagine my surprise to hear most of my letter of
                    request coming back at me in the form of a Papal address to the assembled
                    group!! I guess the English language papal speech writer was rushed that
                    day!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Please let me interrupt for just a moment. You're telling
                        obviously the stories in which you are personally involved. How often was
                        the Ambassador, whom so far I sense an admiration for and a respect for his
                        background and authority .....but - how often was he playing this role as
                        leader, or were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Or the political officer....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the one political officer, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. The political officer, Louis Nigro at this time and later Craig
                    Kelly, and I normally had one or two meetings at the Vatican each day about
                    various political subjects in which our government was interested.. Each
                    morning, after reading the daily cable traffic from Washington and our posts
                    around the world, we would decide , on which subject it was worth seeking
                    Vatican support or clarification. The Ambassador, William A. Wilson, went
                    occasionally to the Vatican on political matters. He interested himself in
                    “other political matters” at times - that is, political situations which were in
                    no way within the purview of our Embassy!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Instructions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh yes, often official State Department instructions. Especially when Mr.
                    Elliot Abrams (Assistant Secretary for Latin American Affairs) was involved!
                    Often we had two or three sets of instructions each day!! You'll remember that
                    the time frame of our discussion is the late ''80s - - and Nicaragua was in the
                    forefront!! President Ortega, Colonel Oliver North. the “Sandinista” government
                    of Nicaragua, their Minister for Education, Rev. Francis Cardinal. Oh yes - -
                    were very involved in this situation - especially because of the Church's great
                    influence in Central and Latin America. Some of the things Abrams wanted us to
                    urge the Holy See to do were simply outrageous!! It took a lot of courage -
                    believe me - to refuse one of his orders! He was a most arrogant young man -
                    who, at that time, was all-powerful in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had Central America as I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - and you can just imagine the influence of the Church in Central
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that there was a fellow by the name of
                        Colonel Oliver North somehow involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Colonel North was involved as well in our Central American policy -
                    as you well remember!</p>
                <p>Ambassador Wilson certainly did involve himself when crucial events took place. I
                    only worked with him in Rome for a little over a year, because, perhaps you
                    remember, he made an unauthorized trip to see Colonel Muammar Qadhafi in
                    Libya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wondered when the name Qadhafi was going to come
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. Bill Wilson upset the White House by going off to visit the Colonel
                    - at a time when the U. S. government was attempting to ostracize the world's
                    foremost supporter of terrorism from the community of nations. You'll recall
                    that the U. S. goal at the time was to attempt to stop Qadhafi from acting as
                    the Soviet surrogate in subverting other nations. At that point, Washington did
                    not want any Americans - official or plain civilians - visiting Libya -
                    especially following the slaughter carried out by the Libyans at the Rome and
                    Vienna Airports. In effect, the White House judged that Bill Wilson undermined
                    our anti-terrorist policy. For its part, the Department of State flatly denied
                    that Bill Wilson had been authorized to visit Colonel Qadhafi in an attempt to
                    reduce tension. In breaking the “rules of the game” the Ambassador profoundly
                    embarrassed his friend, the President, and - according to the Secretary of State
                    - “brought shame and dishonor on his country.</p>
                <p>What - or who - convinced Bill Wilson to make his now-famous trip to see Colonel
                    Qadhafi? There has been much speculation on this subject. Some believed that the
                    President and Bill Casey (CIA Director) cooked it up together. Others believed
                    that the then-Italian Foreign Minister - Giulio Andreotti -convinced Bill that
                    it would be a “coup” for the West - and the United States in particular - if he
                    could make Qadhafi see the errors of his ways and repent!! (Bill and Andreotti
                    had become friends over the years that Bill was in Rome.) I believe this latter
                    theory of the origin of the trip: Andreotti was one of the most duplicitous
                    diplomats I have ever met. There was an angle to his every utterance. I could
                    imagine Bill Wilson being flattered to be taken into the confidence of such an
                    important actor on the world's political stage - at that point in history.
                    Unfortunately....for Bill....the rest is history!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had him only for a year, then just for administrative
                        matters, the other three years you had who as Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Let's see, the post was vacant and I was Charg� for perhaps ten months
                    following Bill Wilson's abrupt departure. Then Mr. Frank Shakespeare was
                    appointed. Frank Shakespeare came directly from Portugal, where he had been
                    ambassador for a year or so. He had previously been Director of the United
                    States Information Agency (USIA) and president of CBS.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was for two years? He was still there when you
                        left Rome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: He was still Ambassador at that time.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: I was Charg� for about ten months. You have no idea, Bill, how
                    sought-after the position of Ambassador to the Holy See actually is!! During the
                    “inter-regnum” I received several phone calls a week from very prominent
                    personalities - from the business world, the political field, the entertainment
                    field, etc. While I was Charg� of the Embassy, I had telephone calls from the
                    most unlikely people asking questions about the position - about the Residence;
                    the size of the staff, ....all of the perks connected with the job!Even the
                    Speaker of the House of Representatives - Tip O'Neill - called to ask about the
                    “ambassadorial list” and if I had heard who had the best shot at the job!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are some of the other major political situations you
                        were working on in Rome, Peter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Let me just quickly go through this, Bill. Naturally we were very
                    involved in the Solidarity union movement in Poland as I previously mentioned.
                    This subject, given its importance to our nation, took a lot of our time. The
                    collapse of communism not only in Poland but throughout the Soviet empire in
                    Eastern Europe was a major subject of our political reporting for over two
                    years. We met frequently with visitors from every Eastern European nation - with
                    the exception of Albania - which was, at that time, a special case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As an additional source of information for
                        Washington......or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, of course. We were also active in reporting on human rights
                    violations in all areas of the Soviet Union - especially in Ukraine and
                    Lithuania and Romania. I very frequently held meetings with so-called
                    “underground bishops” from the Ukraine and Lithuania who would come to Rome
                    often disguised as bus drivers for Polish tour groups! These men actually were
                    bishops of the Catholic Church in the Ukraine - but called “underground clergy”
                    simply because they were obliged to concealed their identity from the State.
                    During the workweek, they had ordinary “civilian” jobs in their country. These
                    bishops had no opportunity to speak with our officers at the Embassy in Moscow
                    as American diplomats were restricted in their travel. I doubt if these bishops
                    would have spoken freely and openly with American diplomats back home in the
                    Ukraine - even if our people had been able to travel from Moscow. The situation
                    would have been too dangerous for them - and also for their flock. My meeting in
                    Rome with these Catholic bishops frequently took place during a stroll in the
                    quite beauty of the Vatican gardens - behind the Papal Palace in the Vatican
                    City. There, in this secluded area - and on the territory of the actual
                    mini-State to which I was accredited by our government - there was no

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The cardinal in the Ukraine once spoke to me and Tom
                        Buchanan when we went into his church. Very privately and very secretively

                <p>MURPHY: I worked very closely with another American (naturalized) cardinal in
                    Rome, Cardinal Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky. Lubachivsky's actual title is “ Major
                    Archbishop” of Lvov, (Ukraine) and is the successor to Cardinal Joseph Cesalo
                    Slipji. One of my first official duties upon arrival in Rome was to head the
                    official American delegation at Cardinal Slipji's funeral - at the direction of
                    the White House. Cardinal Slipji was for more than 25 years imprisoned in the
                    Soviet gulags and was released following diplomatic pressure applied on the
                    Soviet government by both President John F. Kennedy and Pope John XXIII. The odd
                    title of “Major Archbishop” was dreamed up during the days of Pope Paul VI - in
                    order to help placate the Ukrainians who actually wanted the person holding the
                    position to be named “Patriarch of the Ukraine” - a title that Cardinal Slipji
                    always used - much to the Holy See's consternation! The Vatican did not want to
                    create another Patriarchiate - lest the Orthodox Patriarch be offended. The
                    relations between the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the entire Orthodox
                    world has always caused tremendous problems from Rome. It fact - the ecumenical
                    dialogue with the Orthodox seemed to me to be the most difficult undertaken by
                    Rome. It appeared that they were thwarted at every turn. You can get an idea of
                    the difficulties involved when you study the history of the original break with
                    Rome - generations ago - over the “filioque” clause in the Creed!!</p>
                <p>During my tour in Rome, Cardinal Lubachivsky was living in exile in the city. I
                    had a lot of contact with him - and his personal secretary Msgr. Ivan Dacko
                    regarding the actual situation back in the Ukraine - including the human rights
                    violations in the country. These men were frequently guests in my home. The
                    sources of information from the Ukraine available to the Cardinal was fantastic.
                    Not only would he receive weekly reports written on the difficulties being
                    experienced by religious groups via Moscow - or even Manchuria and Japan - but
                    the Ukrainian “Diaspora” in Argentina, the United States, England, Australia and
                    other countries would cable information to the Cardinal. Often, we even received
                    video tapes which showed clandestine gatherings of Christians in the forest
                    outside of Kiev! All of this was passed on through our little Embassy - to
                    Washington - where it was much appreciated by various various sectors of the
                    government.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Lubachivsky, a naturalized American citizen, was formerly a Ukrainian
                    Greek Catholic Archbishop of Philadelphia. I should record that the Cardinal was
                    very proud of his adoptive land - and never failed to mention his U. S.
                    citizenship in public whenever the occasion arose at a press conference, media
                    interview, etc. I admired him for his bravery as well as the courageous way he
                    stood up to him many critics in the Vatican itself. I attended a world-wide
                    Synod of Ukrainian bishops at the Vatican - over which he presided. For me it
                    was an eye-opener. The cardinal had often lamented over the quality and
                    education of his hierarchy in various nations throughout the world. During the
                    Synod, I sympathized with him!! Many of his bishops had little interest in the
                    conditions in the “Ukrainian homeland”. Their efforts were concentrated on the
                    welfare of the people in their churches in their adoptive countries. After so
                    many years abroad - and away from Ukraine - this was natural. The Cardinal never
                    understood this - no matter how many times we discussed the matter.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>His relations with the Vatican were “cool” at best. I recall that a few months
                    after he was elevated to the rank of cardinal, Lubachivsky asked me if I knew
                    how much the cardinals of the Roman Curia received as a “stipend” each month!!
                    He told me that he had received nothing since his elevation to the College of
                    Cardinals - - and he didn't know who to ask!!.....unbelievable!! I did make a
                    few inquiries on his behalf at the Secretariat of State in the Vatican and, in
                    no uncertain terms, was told that “ That Ukrainian cardinal was not entitled to
                    a cent from the Vatican - given the fact that he has the entire Ukrainian Church
                    to support him!!” I have not seen Lubachivsky since he returned to his newly
                    independent homeland and taken up his rightful position as spiritual leader of
                    his people in Kiev. I have read, however, that the serious difficulties with the
                    Orthodox Church in the area continue to this day. I saw the same problem - but
                    perhaps to an even more intense degree - in Romania in 1991 when I was sent
                    there by the Department of State on a special mission regarding the adoption of
                    Romanian children by American citizens.</p>
                <p>I should touch briefly (.....or this report will NEVER end, Bill!) on the
                    situation in the Middle East and the Holy See's involvement and interests in the
                    region. Our Embassy worked very closely with the Vatican on the various hostage
                    situations - as well as with the office of the Patriarch of Lebanon in helping
                    Washington to better understand the complex political situation in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes....Lebanon. On the hostage situations, our Embassy worked very
                    closely - and well - with the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury and also
                    with World Council of Churches in Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Archbishop of Canterbury, if I recall, had his man -
                        Terry Waite.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Indeed! Terry Waite was a frequent visitor to our office in Rome! I could
                    add many chapters to the various books written on the exploits of the famed
                    Terry Waite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe Mr. Anderson did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. I was, naturally, involved in the Rome end of things which involved
                    Terry Waite. Do you recall the release of a Father Jenco from his captors in
                    Lebanon - after being held for over four years?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed I do. Give us a sample of how you were
                        involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Early on in my tour in Rome Mr. Waite came frequently from London to Rome
                    and always visited our Embassy - but - - he would only speak with Ambassador
                    Wilson. I always found Waite to be a very pompous and demanding person - - and I
                    really couldn't understand why he was bothering us all the time!! I asked Bill
                    Wilson why Waite didn't go to the British Embassy for his briefings - as well as
                    for introduction to the key Vatican players in the Middle East. In a round-about
                    fashion, Bill explained that Terry Waite was somehow working “on behalf of - or
                    together with - - or under the auspices of” - our Central Intelligence Agency.
                    William Casey (then Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and close
                    personal friend of Bill Wilson) had somehow authorized Waite access to our
                    communications - at least while he was in Rome!!</p>
                <p>In my dealings with Mr. Waite, I never did come to trust the man. I thought he
                    was much too talkative to be provided with sensitive information. I know for a
                    fact that the Vatican felt the same way because the Foreign Minister, Archbishop
                    Silvestrini, told me so on more than one occasion.</p>
                <p>Upon Farther Jenco's release in Lebanon - which was reported throughout the world
                    - Mr. Waite just happened to be present - - and took over the situation from the
                    moment of Jenco's release! He orchestrated press conferences; he accompanied
                    Jenco to the U. S Military Hospital in Wiesbaden, Germany. From there, Waite
                    called me in Rome and insisted that the Embassy obtain a private audience for
                    Fr. Jenco “at once” as Fr. Jenco had “ a personal message for the Holy Father —
                    as well as one for the Archbishop of Canterbury, from his captors. The message
                    regarded the fate of the hostages he had left behind in Lebanon - including
                    Terry Anderson.” The claim that Father Jenco was carrying a message for the Pope
                    was true; there was no message, however, for the Archbishop of Canterbury - this
                    was all made up by Waite. As a result of this fabrication, however, he and
                    Father Jenco flew by US Military aircraft from Rome to London before returning
                    to Washington.!!</p>
                <p>This is rather amusing part of the story of Fr. Jenco's release: when I did call
                    for the requested Audience - on a hot summer Sunday afternoon - I spoke with
                    Msgr. Stanislaw Dziwisz, the Pope's personal secretary, at the Papal summer
                    villa at Castel Gandolfo. Dziwisz told me he couldn't give me an answer at once
                    but would call me later that evening - because “the Pope is in the swimming pool
                    and he didn't want to disturb him”! (How times have changed, huh - Bill!)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's for sure!! Isn't there also a special connection
                        Waite supposedly had with Oliver North?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: You are right, Bill. Terry Waite called from our Embassy to the White
                    House to speak with Colonel North. I presume that Colonel North thought Waite
                    was a good “front man” for his projects involving the Middle East!!</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was part American in this work with the
                        hostages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Terry Waite was indeed involved with our government's efforts to release
                    American citizens held captive by terrorists in Lebanon and other countries of
                    the Middle East. The exact extent of his involvement and its purpose - was never
                    revealed or explained to me. It was handled exclusively by Ambassador William
                    Wilson in Rome. The Vatican, however, was suspicious of Waite's activity - - and
                    I frequently discussed this matter with Archbishop Achille Silvestrini - the
                    “Foreign Minister”. Silvestrini was convinced that Terry Waite was employed by
                    the CIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wilson, then, was receiving separate instructions, perhaps
                        to which you were not privy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I presume so, Bill.</p>
                <p>To resume the story of Father Jenco's arrival in Rome: I was called back that
                    same evening by the Pope's secretary from Castel Gandolfo - and he told me that
                    the Pope would receive Fr. Jenco - and his family members who had flown to
                    Lebanon to greet him on his release - after the Wednesday General Audience in
                    the Aula Paolo VI - build after Nervi's design.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's remind the reader of Father Jenco. He was a Catholic
                        priest, assigned in Beirut and also working for the Vatican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No. Father Jenco was a missionary working in Beirut. He had nothing to do
                    with the Vatican. He never worked, as far as I know, for the Vatican in any
                    capacity. He was engaged in refugee work in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The refugees that came also to Beirut to be processed. I
                        think I dealt with him.Perhaps it was at Catholic Relief Services when I was
                        serving in Beirut.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I believe Fr. Jenco was held prisoner for about 5 years. For at least
                    half of that time he was held in solitary confinement. Then he was with Terry
                    Anderson, he was with various other prisoners from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And was released in the normal sequence of events?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>MURPHY: I really shouldn't go,......can't go into the release part of it. But,
                    Father Jenco was released by the terrorists from his terrible ordeal, and he did
                    have this message for the Pope which the terrorists insisted that he deliver
                    directly to the Holy Father as soon as possible following his release. He
                    arrived on US military aircraft from the USAF Hospital in Wiesbaden, Germany -
                    accompanied by Mr. Terry Waite. Naturally the world press was there on the
                    tarmac of the Rome Airport waiting for him. Fr. Jenco was in shock - so Terry
                    Waite spoke on his behalf.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'd only been out three or four days perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I had the impression Mr. Waite rather enjoyed speaking to the press!! In
                    fact - after the third Waite press conference in three days, Father Jenco took
                    me aside and - while acknowledging he was in no condition to speak in public (he
                    was really a nervous wreck!!) - asked if I would speak in his stead. Jenco said
                    he had no idea why Terry Waite was traveling with him; and he was told in Beirut
                    by US government officials that Mr. Waite had nothing at all to do with his
                    release. He insisted that Mr. Waite not speak for him to the press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Waite evidently loved being in the spotlight, didn't
                        he??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. He was very much at home in that role. So - we went to the Vatican
                    to see the Foreign Minister, Archbishop Silvestrini. This was prior to the
                    meeting with the Pope. At the end of our meeting, Mr. Waite pulled out a
                    statement and said to Archbishop Silvestrini, “This is what I propose that
                    Father Jenco read to the press after his audience with the Holy Father. Would
                    you mind looking it over?” He handed the papers to the archbishop. I was floored
                    by his audacity in preparing a statement in Fr. Jenco's name commenting on a
                    meeting which had not yet taken place.......and so was Archbishop Silvestrini.
                    As Terry Waite and Father Jenco left the office, I recall Silvestrini asking me
                    to stay behind and then he asked,” Look - tell me something. For whom does Mr.
                    Waite really work?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Archbishop of Canterbury or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I had to assure him that as far as I knew his employer was the office of
                    the Archbishop of Canterbury.....but I agreed that the whole situation was
                    indeed very strange.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Another subject, Bill: I want to mention the close working relationship our small
                    embassy had with both delegations.(Argentine and Chilean) working toward the
                    Beagle Channel negotiations. As you perhaps recall, the Holy See was the
                    mediator in this long-standing territorial dispute between Argentina and Chile.
                    The Holy See did a great service in mediating this dispute and brought it to a
                    successful conclusion without additional bloodshed. In fact - the Papal
                    mediation was so successful that both Washington and London subsequently
                    proposed that the Vatican step in as mediator in two other international
                    disagreements. In presenting Washington's requests to the Vatican, however,
                    Cardinal Casaroli, explained to me that Beagle Channel-type mediation was
                    impossible for the Holy See over the long term — due to the lack of diplomatic
                    personnel in the Vatican as well as the enormous expenses involved. I would like
                    to point out that our government was involved in this issue from the day I
                    arrived at post (8/84) until its successful conclusion two years later.
                    Continuing reports on the progress of the negotiations were sent on a regular
                    basis to State.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Beagle Channel being a channel at the very bottom of
                        South America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It is located at the northern border between Argentina and Chile.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No - something quite different! When I arrived in Rome in 1984, both
                    Argentina and Chile had separate delegations at the Vatican engaged in full-time
                    negotiations over this problem. This was in addition to their respective
                    embassies to the Holy See. It was very interesting for Washington to be kept
                    up-to-date on the progress of the negotiations - via our small embassy. Several
                    people at State complimented us on our reporting. Q: And it was resolved largely
                    because of the Vatican's good will?</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - - I would say - good will plus plenty of patience! Another issue in
                    which we were directly involved was “SDI” - the Strategic Defense Initiative (a
                    space-based missile defense system) of the Reagan Administration....or Star
                    Wars, if you will! The main reason for our involvement: There had been a high
                    level of interest in the Vatican in S.D.I. issues.The Pontifical Academy of
                    Science - which I previously described - had completed a year-long study of the
                    Administrations initiative - and, according to the media - the verdict was
                    negative!! It was reported in November of 1985 that the Academy was to issue a
                    strong condemnation of our entire SDI initiative. Press speculation abounded:
                    The Pope Condemns Reagan's Initiatives; Star War Dead!! You can imagine the
                    direct White House interest in this subject, Bill! We had calls day and night
                    from Washington asking us to confirm if the rumors were indeed true. If true -
                    to somehow convince the Holy See of our defensive point of view. In the end -
                    nothing was ever issued by the Vatican....no paper...no press conference. The
                    Pontifical Academy's report was sent to the Pope and nothing more heard of it.
                    The Embassy never received a copy of the final report and several sources told
                    us that it had been destroyed. Given the political situation of the time - - and
                    the prospect of the break up of the Soviet Empire - - I believe that John Paul
                    II simply sat on the report!! The same type of educational effort was made in
                    defending the neutron bomb. The Embassy undertook an initiative to explain to
                    Vatican officials just what the weapon was and under what conditions it would be
                    used - if ever. In this connection, the Secretary of Defense Casper W.
                    Weinberger visited the Vatican to explain further the philosophy behind our
                    military strength during that period. He insisted that the United States must be
                    able to deal with the Soviets from a position of strength rather than a position
                    of weakness.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. The White House as well as the Pentagon. I met often directly with
                    the President of the Pontifical Academy, Dr. Carlos Chagas, a Brazilian, in
                    order to follow the progress of the Academy's S.D.I.-related paper. Bill Wilson
                    also worked quite diligently in stemming the tide! He spoke with several
                    influential people at the Vatican - as well as members of the diplomatic corps -
                    expounding our point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like many academies, whatever, pontifical, - - there is a

                        contributing scientific data?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The members are not at all bishops - or even clerics, Bill. Members of
                    the Academy come from several nations - and represent the most distinguished
                    academic institutions in the world: Oxford, University of Paris, University of
                    Tokyo, Moscow University, National Institutes of Health, Harvard, University of
                    Oslo, Georgetown University, UCLA, etc. Several of the scientists were from
                    Eastern Europe - including the then-Soviet Union. The Academy advises the Pope
                    on scientific matters - including, in this instance, nuclear weapons.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, not at all. Race or creed do not enter into selection process for
                    Academy membership. The Academy members meet in Rome two or three times a year
                    to conduct a “study week” on a different topic each timer. I have no idea how
                    the topic is chosen —perhaps by the Pope. I know for a fact that he is very
                    interested in the deliberation of the members when they meet in formal sessions.
                    The Pope has on occasion attended meetings - and has made a practice of hosting
                    international meetings at Castel Gandolfo during the summer months. These
                    meetings are open even to non-members of the Papal Academy who are experts in
                    their respective fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the SDI was chosen because it was considered to be, in
                        part, a moral issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right...... because of the universal destruction involved in such
                    a nuclear-based initiative.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Yes, deterrent. There is always that fine line....what is morally
                    acceptable and what is not!! “Does the end justify the means?”</p>
                <p>Bill, we also got involved very seriously with ecumenical questions. In other
                    words....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you start that, let me back up. One more thing on
                        this. There is a science officer at the American Embassy in Rome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, Bill. We had nothing absolutely, substantively, to do with the
                    Embassy in Rome. However, when questions arose involving - say - science: all of
                    our materials were sent to us directly from the Department - or the White House
                    - or where ever. I would, of course, call my colleagues in Embassy Rome if I had
                    a particular question or needed the immediate advice of an expert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though both entities were doing the exact same thing
                        but to two different governments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. I know it sounds crazy but there was a difference. Our Embassy was
                    had a world-wide charge while Rome was involved only with Italy. I frequently
                    noticed in conversation with my colleagues at Embassy Rome - that they did not
                    have all the information passed to us by various of our missions throughout the
                    world - the USUN, etc. It is quite logical if you think of it. Our mission was
                    indeed worldwide - and Embassy Rome's centered on Italy. And to give you another
                    example: when we are assigned to the Political Section of an embassy in a
                    foreign land, we naturally are expected to report on religious matters (no
                    matter what religion) in that country. I recall that one day the Political
                    Counselor at Embassy Rome gave instructions to his people that from that day on
                    all matters relating to the Italian Church would be reported on by the Embassy
                    to the Vatican. I objected very strongly and refused to have our political
                    section take on that added work. We had nothing to do directly with the Church
                    in Italy for that was within the reporting bailiwick of Embassy Rome. I didn't
                    make myself very popular at Embassy Rome by this decision - but I think it was a
                    just one. Religious practices certainly influences society - and politics - in
                    every nation. Just look what a terrible mess we made of Iran by ignoring the
                    influence of religion!!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, a big part of it. Again, Peter, we are talking
                        about that uniqueness of the role you played there of our new mission to the
                        Holy See.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. I believe that the latter point underlines this uniqueness in a
                    dramatic way. To move on to the ecumenical scope to our work, I recall
                    facilitating the official visit of Bishop Robert Browning, the Presiding Bishop
                    of the Episcopal Church in the United States to the Holy See. He and his wife
                    visited for three days as guests of the Vatican. Our Embassy facilitated that
                    visit by acting as an intermediary whenever assistance was requested. Bishop
                    Browning's visit was really very substantive involving the discussion of various
                    political situations around the world (Africa, the U.K. - even Eastern Europe)
                    were within our mandate for political reporting. In addition, there is no doubt
                    in my mind that the visit fostered the spirit of cooperation and sharing between
                    the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And friendly, I take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes indeed - quite friendly. The Archbishop of Canterbury also visited
                    John Paul II while I was in Rome. We were involved in the periphery of some of
                    these visits. The visitors - lay, clerical, military, political, academic,
                    cultural - - you name it, Bill!! Everyone wants to see the Pope - - and this
                    very fact provided the Embassy with a great source of contacts and reporting
                    possibilities which would be rare in a “normal” Embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Given the political overtones of the Orthodox talks, we were also very interested
                    in the ongoing friendly - but most difficult - conversations between the Roman
                    Catholic and various Orthodox Churches. During my tour in Rome, Greece
                    established an Embassy at the Holy See. This was a major step for that
                    government - given the influence of the Greek Orthodox Church in Greek society.
                    I certainly never realized before going to Rome that the dialogue between the
                    Orthodox (of no matter what persuasion) and Rome were so difficult. Such
                    sensitivity is involved!! And the situation is so different, for example,
                    between the Romanian Orthodox, the Russian Orthodox, the Orthodox Church in
                    America. For example, the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church is based in Istanbul
                    (Constantinople) - for historical reasons - even though he doesn't have much of
                    a flock there. I did what I could to facilitate these talks between the two
                    entities. I even worked while on vacation in Israel on this very matter. Jackie
                    and I - I think in 1988 - went with our youngest son, Marc, to visit old friends
                    from Genoa days who were now posted in Tel Aviv. I had never been to Israel and
                    was most interested in visiting as much as possible. Our friends, Dimitri and
                    Christine Loundras, had been posted there for four years. The Greek government
                    did not have full diplomatic relations with Israel, at that time, so Dimitri was
                    assigned to Israel as Minister at the Greek Legation in Tel Aviv. During the
                    course of our stay, Dimitri arranged for me to make an official call on the
                    Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodoros I. I must take a moment to
                    describe this unusual meeting, Bill. Dimitri and I arrived at the Patriarchiate
                    in the old quarter of downtown Jerusalem on a bright and sunny morning. The
                    building itself was very old and the courtyard crowded with people. We were
                    greeted by a very tall fellow in a fez who cleared the way for us through the
                    mob. Dimitri told me that for hundreds of years the majordomo's family - of Arab
                    descent - had been employed by the Patriarchs in Jerusalem. Eventually, we were
                    ushered into a very large room - covered with oriental rugs with stern, dark
                    portraits of former Patriarchs glaring down at us. The Patriarch, Diodoros I,
                    was sitting on his throne dominating the seats of about 20 Greek Orthodox
                    bishops and priests who were sitting around the room. I was shown to a large
                    chair - which was separated from the group - while Dimitri was given a place
                    just behind me. As I sat, a young cleric in flowing robes came and sat at my
                    feet. I soon learned that he was my interpreter! The Patriarch greeted me with a
                    few words in English ...and then said “Speak!”. On the spot, I gave a
                    extemporaneous talk to the gathering. I expressed my pleasure at meeting the
                    Patriarch and being in the historic city of Jerusalem; I explained my diplomatic
                    mission at the Holy See and I also expressed my hope that the dialogues in
                    progress between Rome and Constantinople would be fruitful. I guess I spoke
                    almost 20 minutes. My entire talk was simultaneously translated by the Greek
                    cleric sitting at my feet. Diodoros I then gave his reply. I should explain that
                    he is a huge man and looked even more imposing in his flowing robes and beard,
                    sitting upon his throne. Reading his text, he first welcomed me “ as the
                    representative of a great nation ....to a lesser See in Italy”! He continued, “
                    Welcome, Mr. Murphy, to the center of the universe; to the city where Jesus
                    Christ lived, preached and died.” Throughout his talk, he made pointed negative
                    references to the Roman Church. Towards the end of his half-hour talk, the
                    Patriarch excused himself for receiving me in “such humble surroundings - when
                    you are quite used to the luxury, the fabulous art and architectural monuments
                    of the Vatican. We, however, receive you in humble simplicity - reflecting the
                    true nature of Our Savior, Jesus Christ, in the city where he lived.” He
                    insisted on the poverty of the Patriarchiate. On leaving the meeting, Dimitri
                    told me that - as opposed to what I heard from the Patriarch - he was a wealthy
                    man with Swiss bank accounts! He told me that the Government of Greece
                    contributed over $3 Million each year for the upkeep of the Patriarchiate. At
                    least half that sum was taken by the Patriarch for his personal use. In
                    addition, the Greek Orthodox Church was the proprietor of much of the city of
                    Jerusalem - not only the churches but of several apartment buildings as well as
                    commercial space. All in all - it was a very interesting visit and one which,
                    for me, underlined the difficult task of a meaningful dialogue between Rome and
                    the Orthodox world. In addition, an episcopal member of the Patriarch's staff
                    was in the employ of the Soviet government!</p>

                        example. The very sophisticated,...but to me incomprehensible, discussions

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly. I believe they become important more because of the political
                    implications than the theological. This is seen if you study the differences
                    between the Orthodox church in Romania, Bulgaria, Russia - and Greece. They have
                    great difficulty among themselves - to say nothing of their difficulties with
                    Rome! As a matter of fact, I read recently that the Orthodox churches in the
                    United States have voted to join together as one American Orthodox Church - and,
                    in effect, leaving behind their ties to national ties in East and West Europe.
                    This is a step of major importance - but one which I fear will be quite
                    difficult to implement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other visitors........?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Bill, there were so many official visitors to Rome during my four years
                    there - and they all wanted a private audience with the Holy Father. This, of
                    course, was not possible. I knew full well that some of the politicians simply
                    wanted that photo with the pope so they could run it in the local press - to
                    assure the Catholic vote in their next election! A few Audiences do stand out in
                    my mind. I well remember in the summer of 1986 we had a visit from Senator
                    Edward M. Kennedy and a Kennedy family group of 20! Present were Eunice Shriver,
                    Ethel Kennedy and Pat Lawford - together with various and sundry children - and
                    their spouses. The group had come directly from a tour of Poland - - remember -
                    Bill, this was the height of the “Solidarity period”. Even before their arrival
                    at the Vatican Palace, the Vatican gave strict instructions for the group
                    audience: “only family - no press”. I accompanied the group and we assembled in
                    the small throne room immediately outside the Papal Library.We were arranged in
                    a semicircle around the small Papal throne - and I recall that it was a rather
                    hot and stuffy day. The usher - in tails! - came in and opened some of the huge
                    windows and the white curtains billowed in the breeze! I remember being a bit
                    shocked to note about that time that some of the teen-aged Kennedy girls kicked
                    off their shoes - cooling their hot, tired feel on the nice, cool marble floors
                    of the Papal antechamber! A word to Ethel Kennedy rectified the situation at
                    once! I remember wondering where in the world these kids had been brought up!
                    The Senator asked me if I would ask the Holy Father to pose for pictures with
                    each family group at the end of the audience: i.e. the Edward Kennedys, the
                    Robert Kennedys, the Shrivers, etc. I told him I would ask the Holy Father but
                    he should not be surprised at a negative reply.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>The Senator and his group had asked for a group audience - and that we all that
                    was expected. I knew differently, however. The Papal secretary came to me and
                    asked if the Senator would like to meet with the Pope in private for a few
                    moments. Kennedy, of course, agreed at once. Some day I presume that the subject
                    of this meeting will be made public.</p>
                <p>Fifteen minutes later the Pope entered the room - with the Senator trailing
                    behind. Kennedy introduced his numerous family members to the Pope - and I then
                    transmitted the Senator's request regarding the photographs. The Pope glanced at
                    his watch and said “ Va bene....ma rappidement, per piacere. C'e poco tempo!!”
                    —that is - OKAY - but let's do it fast!. I cried out the names - “the Lawfords,
                    Shrivers, etc” - and the group gathered around the Pope. When it came to Ethel
                    Kennedy's turn, a rather tall young man stood beside her. She said to the Pope -
                    “Please pray for him. He is not one of us!” The pope was bewildered and said to
                    me - “What does she mean”. I said that I presumed that she meant that her
                    son-in-law was not a Catholic! The Pope shrugged his shoulders and said “ That's
                    OKAY - - he's still a good boy”..while giving him a pat on the shoulders!!</p>
                <p>After that audience - we paraded as a troop through the Vatican Palace to the
                    Sala Regina to visit the Pauline Chapel and the Sistine Chapel. Nothing was ever
                    easy in arranging official visits by the Kennedys in a foreign country - not the
                    time I was Ted's control officer in Paris when his brother named him a member of
                    the official US delegation to General Charles de Gaulle's funeral in Notre Dame
                    Cathedral; nor the visit of Jacqueline B. Kennedy - and her children John and
                    Caroline - in 1967 to the Carcano family ranch in Cordoba, Argentina .....nor
                    this “tribal” visit to the Vatican! Concerning the Vatican visit, I should make
                    note that only Mrs. Shriver asked me to whom she should write at the Vatican in
                    thanks for this extraordinary Papal Audience! We, at the Embassy, on course,
                    never heard a word of thanks from Kennedy or his large office staff all in the
                    line of duty! It was this way with any number of Congressional Delegations I
                    have worked with throughout the years.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Of course, Bill, But....allow me first to mention two other major parts
                    of the world which were continually the focus of our political reporting at the
                    Vatican. Latin America, for example. We continually monitored the human rights
                    situation in several Latin American nations. In countries where the population
                    is perhaps 95% nominally Catholic, the Church still has great political and
                    social influence in all sectors of society.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us one example of your work in that
                        area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Let's see: I think it may be useful for the reader if I spoke a bit about
                    what is called Liberation Theology - which was growing influence among both
                    Protestant and Catholic clerics and laymen in a number of Latin American
                    nations. This theological theory had a definite political content - and thus was
                    an object of our political reporting. The tenets “Liberation Theology” can best
                    be described as including doctrine that defines forced poverty and oppression -
                    from the government or the wealthy or ruling classes of a nation - as sins. Some
                    adherents to this theology in the ''70s argue that even violence would be
                    justified to eradicate such poverty.Now, Bill, I realize that may sound like we
                    are getting into a theological discussion, and in effect we are, but soon after
                    the writings on this subject by Latin American priests were publicized
                    throughout the world, the Vatican came out with a strong condemnation of certain
                    aspects of the teaching. Latin American leaders in this field of
                    theological/political thinking were Fathers Leonardo Boff and Gustavo Gutierrez,
                    a Peruvian priest/psychologist who, in the late ''70s, wrote “A Theory of
                    Liberation”. These men represented a large number of clergymen and religious
                    women who were frustrated with the Church's impotence against Latin America's
                    social ills. Many of them took an active role in their countries in representing
                    the poor. You'll recall the difficulty that the Pope himself had with the
                    Marxist priest, Ernesto Cardinal, who was an official of Nicaragua's Sandinista
                    government. The Vatican, in essence, thought the teachings far too political,
                    too much to the left. Although the Pope had always advocated an “option for the
                    poor” - and had indeed called Liberation Theolog“useful and necessary”, he and
                    his advisors in Rome became uncomfortable with the perceived tendency of the
                    movement toward Marxism. The new theology was, in effect, preaching that the
                    wealth of the ruling classes in Latin America should be shared by everyone and
                    some of the adherents to this theology advocated violence to attain this end. I
                    am sure you remember the Maryknoll priests and nuns taking up arms in certain
                    Central and Latin American nations, Bill.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>The condemnation of the new political-theological ideas was led by the Prefect of
                    the Congregation of Holy Office, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger. In 1985 his
                    Congregation published two major documents which made headlines worldwide.
                    Official Washington was very interested in the subject - - given the fact that
                    followers of such a theological premise were starting to cause political unrest
                    in Africa as well as Latin America. Why - the government of Iran even organized
                    a Liberation Theology Conference - inviting leading Catholic scholars to address
                    the assembly in Tehran! Following the publication of Ratzinger's first letter of
                    condemnation of certain aspects of this theology, I recall sending an outline of
                    his letter to all of our diplomatic posts. A friend in Washington called to ask
                    what in the world I was doing - “sending such theological stuff around the
                    world”.Bill - you wouldn't believe the cables I received in Rome - thanking the
                    Embassy for sending an explanation of Liberation Theology - and its consequences
                    - to Tokyo, Helsinki, Moscow, etc. Several posts told us that diplomats from
                    Latin America and Africa, for example, were constantly referring to Liberation
                    Theology - and our people hadn't a clue what they were talking about. I was very
                    pleased, as you can imagine, at this positive reaction to our reporting. The
                    importance of the religious revolution in Iran at the time of the Shah's
                    downfall has always been in my mind whenever I weighed political reporting
                    proposals! I have always believed that all reporting is important - not just the
                    stuff you agree with!! When you stop and think of it for a moment, Bill, it is
                    an obvious fact that several of the armed conflicts in the world have a
                    religious bases: Northern Ireland, Iran, Yugoslavia, Greece-Turkey, Indonesia,
                    Sudan etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to finish with Central America, Peter. We remember,
                        or maybe we've forgotten, how strongly involved the Reagan Administration
                        was in making certain that everything went our way in Central America, and
                        what Liberation Theology meant, because priests got murdered and priests
                        made trouble and priests took up guns. We have only to look at the murdered
                        Archbishop of San Salvador - Archbishop Oscar A. Romero - and the six
                        Jesuits and their housekeeper at the university there. So this theology you
                        are speaking of was very much involved with our Central American
                        policy.</hi>

                    unusual assignment to the Vatican and perhaps talk a little bit about one

                <p>MURPHY: Okay. Bill, before we get on to the Pope, I would like to leave the
                    reader with a flavor of the types of visitors we dealt with on an almost daily
                    basis as well as those members of our government having serious business at the
                    Embassy and at the Vatican. I'll just read you a list of some of the interesting
                    people that I worked with during my tour ..... and hope you don't think I am
                    just “name dropping”. I would simply like to give you an idea of the people who
                    are attracted there and travel to Rome on business for our government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were involved with them personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I was involved with practically every visit of an official American to
                    the Vatican. There are many tales connected with these visits - because we got a
                    chance to be with and speak directly to these people for extended periods of
                    time. (There is a lot of waiting at the Vatican!!). I also think that most
                    people - no matter who they are - are awed by the prospect of meeting the Holy
                    Father in person. They are usually a bit nervous - no matter what their position
                    in government - - and don't know quite what to expect. I figured that a part of
                    my job was to put these people at ease!</p>
                <p>I recall waiting with President Reagan in a “holding room” in the Vatican Palace
                    prior to one of his Audiences. Although there seemed to be the usual “cast of
                    thousands” accompanying us to and from the Vatican that day, for some reason I
                    was left alone with the President for about 10 minutes. The President pulled out
                    of his coat pocket a 3 x 5 white card on which were noted about 10 major
                    subjects he wanted to raise with the Pope. He asked if I would review them with
                    him. As I had been responsible for gathering most of the points on that list
                    months before and cabling them to the White House, I was quite familiar with
                    this list! The President went through each point without hesitation. I was
                    really impressed since - if one were to believe the press at that point in time
                    - Reagan slept through half the meetings he attended! After this review, the
                    President commented “The Pope must have a hell of a job, Peter. It must really
                    be tough to be in his position these days.” When I asked why he thought that,
                    the President replied with a question for me. “How long is it”, he asked, “since
                    you have lived in the United States”. When I told him it had been about ten
                    years, he said, “You can't imagine how leftist and liberal all members of the
                    clergy are these days - Protestant, Catholic and Jewish. I'll give you a good
                    example: last year the University of Notre Dame gave me an Honorary Degree. Well
                    - I arrived at the campus in a large motorcade. The entire campus was blocked as
                    a protest to my visit. You'll never guess who was leading this protest.......
                    none other than a group of Maryknoll nuns!” The President was genuinely shocked
                    by this fact! I thought that the President would really be amazed if he could
                    have heard the political opinions and philosophies of some of the Jesuits living
                    at the Rome Jesuit Headquarters - Borgo S. Spirito, 5 - - a five minute walk
                    from the Vatican!</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>Other visitors included, for example, Geraldine Ferraro, former Democratic
                    candidate for Vice President and her husband who came to Rome for a Papal
                    Audience prior to making her first visit to the People's Republic of China. I
                    recall that Bill Wilson wouldn't have a thing to do with her - - while Max and
                    Ruth Rabb hosted a large dinner party in her honor! (The differences between
                    ambassadors - both Republican!)As I was accompanying Mrs. Ferraro into the Papal
                    Library - a group of cardinals was leaving. One said to me, in Italian,
                    “Congratulations, Mr. Murphy! You have two Americans on the new list of
                    cardinals - O'Connor of New York and Law of Boston!” After the group passed,
                    Mrs. Ferraro took me by the arm and said - “Don't tell me it's true! O'Connor
                    won - and I lost!! and I had to hear it here in the Pope's house!” She did have
                    a good sense of humor - and impressed me as a very intelligent and caring
                    person.</p>
                <p>Others who came to visit various Vatican offices included Robert Novak, Edward
                    Bennett and William Buckley. Many academics and writers came to discuss
                    political and cultural matters with officials of the Holy See. Admiral James
                    Watkins, Chief of Naval Operations, and then Secretary of Energy came several
                    times to Rome. He was a good friend of Bill Wilson's and also had a son, James,
                    studying at the North American College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, for business with the Vatican rather than coming to
                        be briefed by you, or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Both. With visitors from State, the White House, NSC to other parts of
                    the government - we would normally hold briefings at the Embassy prior to our
                    meetings at the Vatican. General Vernon A. Walters (former Deputy Director of
                    the Central Intelligence Agency under George Bush and our Ambassador to the
                    United Nations and, later, to Germany) came to Rome on several occasions.
                    Walters' missions were quite specific: to brief the Pope on major political
                    situations around the globe. In all of the private meetings I have attended with
                    Pope John Paul II, the Audiences involving General Walters were by far the most
                    interesting. To begin with - the Pope felt most comfortable with General Walters
                    - simply because he spoke fluent Italian - the Pope's working language. I recall
                    one day when we walked into the Pope's Library. he threw out his arms and said
                    “Welcome, Mr. Ambassador! Finally an American Ambassador I can
                    understand!!”.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his role at that time? With the CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No. During my time in Rome, Walters visited as our Ambassador to the
                    United Nations. His role was to brief the Holy Father on explosive situations in
                    the world at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when General - Ambassador Walters became your boss
                        later on in Germany, he had already gotten to know you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, we knew each other very well by the time we reached Bonn. I have
                    always had great admiration for him - both as a person and as a great public
                    servant of our nation. It was as a results of my getting to know Ambassador
                    Vernon Walters during this period that he asked me to join him in Bonn - my next
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>Then, Bill, as I have already mentioned, we had presidential visits to the
                    Vatican. President and Mrs. Reagan came twice to see the Pope while I was at
                    post in Rome. The preparations, as you well know, are simply unbelievable.
                    Substantive work of all kind stops for about two weeks prior to the visit; three
                    advance teams visit the post; their demands are unbelievable.......the Secret
                    Service always wanted to search the Pope's Library where the Audience with the
                    President would take place! They never did get in, of course, but it wasn't for
                    lack of trying. I was even accused by members of the advance teams of working
                    for the Vatican instead of the United States because I would not push the Papal
                    Household hard enough to permit an SY search of the Pope's private library!!</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>Nancy Reagan visited the Vatican once by herself - to foster her “Just Say No!”
                    anti drug program. Her staff thought that it would be a great boost to her anti
                    drug campaign to receive the Holy Father's approval of her efforts. Thus, the
                    main object of her visit was to obtain Papal endorsement of her program. I
                    recall that the visit took place on a beautiful spring day (May 4). Mrs. Reagan
                    had sent orders by cable from Washington that, for her audience with the Pope,
                    she would wear a black silk suit and a hat. Normally, the wives of Chiefs of
                    State are dressed in long black dresses with a mantilla as a head covering. Mrs.
                    Reagan requested that Betty Wilson and my wife, Jacqueline, be similarly
                    attired! I remember Jackie calling me from a downtown Rome shop to tell me that
                    the cheapest black silk suit she found cost over One Million Lire! I suggested
                    she get a linen suit - and be done with it. No one would know the difference!!
                    For this visit, Betty and Bill Wilson had a special room constructed (cost
                    $65,000!!) at their Residence to host a private luncheon for the First Lady
                    following her visit to the Vatican. (Their dining room at the Residence was too
                    small to handle a large luncheon party.) Special table decorations were made in
                    Venice - - and the room in which we dined is now known as “The Nancy Reagan
                    Room” at the ambassadorial residence Villa Richardson on Via G. Medici -
                    property of the American Academy in Rome and leased to the United States
                    government. I was rather surprised to learn that Nancy Reagan controlled the
                    details of Guest List for this luncheon - which she approved in advance from the
                    White House. A couple of the invited guests were - at the last moment -
                    dis-invited by the White House! God only knows what these poor souls had done to
                    fall into Nancy's disfavor. I had pity on our protocol people who had to
                    telephone and explain “sending the luncheon invitation in error”! If you can
                    believe it - - even the seating designations for this luncheon were cabled to
                    Mrs. Reagan for her approval - - and she actually did change some of the
                    seating! The event included about 30 guests: the Secretary of State Cardinal
                    Casaroli, the Foreign Minister Archbishop Silvestrini, Audrey Hepburn and her
                    long-time friend, the author Gore Vidal as well as a few of the titled Roman
                    nobility who were ever-present at our official receptions and dinners. The
                    reason I recall that Audrey Hepburn was present was because that day - May 4th -
                    was her birthday - and Jackie's as well! Everyone toasted their Birthdays.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>Speaking of Nancy Reagan: I should record my impressions of this famous lady
                    here. As mentioned earlier, Nancy Reagan was a very close friend of Betty Wilson
                    and her husband, Ambassador William A. Wilson. The moment it was made public in
                    the world press that Bill had undertaken an “unauthorized trip” to Libya
                    (referred to elsewhere in this oral history) - and subsequently disgraced
                    President Ronald Reagan by this act, the Wilson-Reagan friendship was put on
                    hold! The Wilsons left Rome within a few months of the infamous trip to Libya.
                    Following the arrival of Frank Shakespeare as ambassador seven months later, our
                    Embassy began receiving strange messages from the White House! To give you an
                    example, Bill: we were aware that the Wilsons planned a trip from their home in
                    California to Rome so that Bill could present his official portrait for our
                    Embassy.....as is common practice at many of our missions around the world. Bill
                    had his portrait done by a noted Portuguese artist. Word arrived, via Nancy
                    Reagan's Chief of Staff, that there was to be no ceremony held in the Embassy in
                    connection with the presentation of the Wilson portrait; that no member of the
                    Embassy staff was to attend any social gathering in Rome or the Vatican in honor
                    of the Wilsons - and, in addition, we were to cable all invitations to such
                    events to the White House for their information!! The Friends of the Vatican
                    Museum, a group of art-lovers founded with the Wilsons' assistance and backing,
                    gave a formal dinner in the Vatican Museums itself in honor of the Wilsons.
                    Frank Shakespeare, ambassador at the time, actually left Rome for the weekend on
                    instructions from Washington so as not to be present in the city at the time of
                    at the event honoring the Wilsons! As I was Charg� at the time - I was of course
                    “too busy” to attend - according to White House instructions!! The interesting
                    thing about the many invitations arriving at that time at the embassy was the
                    fact that one was for a luncheon honoring Betty Wilson - and my wife, Jackie,
                    was authorized - via cable from Washington - to attend that function!! (Who says
                    Big Brother is not watching you!!)</p>
                <p>Another very strange instruction coming from the White House directed us to
                    “warn” Cardinal William Wakefield Baum - former Archbishop of Washington, DC and
                    a close friend of the Wilsons - that, as an American and also Vatican official,
                    he would do well to limit his contacts with the Wilsons - as the couple was “not
                    looked upon favorably by President and Mrs. Reagan.” It was evident that Nancy
                    Reagan was attempting to limit Betty and Bill Wilson's contacts abroad. I cannot
                    believe that the President knew anything about such orders coming from his
                    wife's office in the East Wing of the White House. I have never before seen such
                    evidence of personal spite in my entire life! I thought, at the time, that Nancy
                    Reagan must be a most vindictive woman! It is ironic that since the Reagans
                    moved back to Los Angeles, the Wilsons are now among their closest friends. They
                    live near each other. Betty did all she could to help ease the Reagans return to
                    a normal Californian life after eight years in the White House. Cardinal Baum,
                    as you can well imagine, Bill, was outraged by suggestion that he break his
                    friendship with the Wilsons at the suggestion of the White House .......and
                    rightly so in my opinion.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>Another even more outrageous example of Mrs. Reagan's direct intervention in our
                    Mission's affairs took place shortly prior to the Holy Father's second Pastoral
                    Visit to the United States - when he visited the South and West of our country.
                    One fine day the Embassy received a cable from the Department of State
                    instructing us to send a Diplomatic Note to the Vatican informing the Foreign
                    Ministry that the U. S. government requested that the Holy Father take no public
                    notice of either Mr. or Mrs. William A. Wilson at any public event connected
                    with his forthcoming visit to our country. The telegram also mentioned that the
                    Embassy should warn American prelates stationed at the Holy See that the they
                    should beware of forming close friendships with the Wilsons - who were “personae
                    non grata” at the White House!! My advice to Frank Shakespeare was: 1) that we
                    check out the authenticity of this crazy message with the State Department and
                    2) that we remind State that the Wilsons are American citizens. In my opinion,
                    the US government had no business instructing a foreign Chief of State (the
                    Pope, in this case) who he can and cannot speak with when he is visiting in our
                    country! In reply to our query, the State Department assured us that the message
                    had the approval of James Baker, the then Chief of Staff at the White House and
                    also “of Nancy Reagan's people” in the West Wing of the White House! Frank was
                    thus obliged to deliver the Diplomatic Note to the Secretariat of State at the
                    Vatican. (I do wish I had kept a copy of that Note! I am sure the Vatican kept
                    their copy!) The Vatican's reaction was as expected - word spread throughout
                    Rome in hours. I'll wager that every member of the American Catholic hierarchy
                    knew of the White House's instructions within 24 hours of the delivery of that
                    Diplomatic Note to the Vatican. There was general disbelief among friends at the
                    Vatican that our government could make such a request involving American
                    citizens - and the first American Ambassador to the Holy See at that! I recall
                    consulting with the President of the Pontifical Diplomatic Academy at the time -
                    Archbishop Justin Rigali (an American citizen from California) - who was stunned
                    with the news of our diplomatic demarche! Needless to say, John Paul II took not
                    the slightest notice of our “instructions” - and warmly greeted both Betty and
                    Bill when they met him at the airport upon his arrival in Florida - as well as
                    at other stops along the route of his travels in the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>My tale of Nancy Reagan's involvement in our little Embassy does not finish here!
                    There is more, Bill - incredible as it may seem! Ambassador Frank Shakespeare
                    followed the Holy Father around the U.S. on his historic visit. (As all Papal
                    travels to foreign countries are “Pastoral” in nature, Frank was not present in
                    any “official” capacity.) Following the joint visit of the Pope and Nancy Reagan
                    to an elementary school classroom in California, the Pope left by helicopter for
                    the next leg of his visit to that State. Nancy Reagan cornered Frank Shakespeare
                    and questioned him about the “serious leaks of inside information within the
                    Embassy to the Vatican to the Wilsons”. Nancy claimed she had proof that someone
                    in the Embassy was telling the Wilsons everything that happened on a regular
                    basis. She named Mirella Giacalone - our Protocol Assistant as well as my
                    secretary at the time - and faithful long-time American citizen employee of the
                    Embassy as the culprit. Frank came back to Rome and - after recounting this odd
                    tale of his private conversation with the First Lady - said that, unfortunately,
                    we had to fire Mirella on Nancy Reagan's direct orders! I strongly objected and
                    told Frank there was absolutely no proof to the claim that Mirella Giacalone had
                    passed information to the Wilsons. We could not simply fire one of our best and
                    most loyal employees based on hearsay. It took me a few weeks, but I finally
                    managed to have Frank drop the matter. I consider this a major accomplishment
                    given the fact that Mrs. Reagan's Chief of Staff called us in Rome three or four
                    times to learn how the matter was progressing! Never in my life would I have
                    believed a First Lady of the Untied States of America would have directly
                    interfered with our relations with a nation over such a petty matter - if I had
                    not experienced it with my own eyes and ears!</p>
                <p>To continue, Bill —the Embassy at the Holy See also hosted many other official
                    visits during my four years in Rome, including that of Vice President and Mrs.
                    George Bush and Secretary and Mrs. George Shultz . National Security Advisor
                    Robert (Bud) McFarlane visited on four occasions to brief the Holy Father.
                    Senator Robert Dole, Senator Edward Kennedy, as well as several Congressional
                    delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What stories, Peter! Some people went there for political
                        reasons, but obviously some for substantive reasons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right, Bill. There were many substantive visits. The Middle East
                    remains today an area of great concern to the Holy See. Many of our Arab experts
                    visited the Vatican. I recall that Ambassador April Glaspie visited the Vatican
                    when she was seeking to understand the Rome's position on the Middle East
                    problem. April spent two days in conversations with Arab/Israeli experts in the
                    Secretariat of State. You will recall that April Glaspie was our ill-fated
                    ambassador in Iraq just prior to the start of the Gulf War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indeed. Did she come after she...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No, April Glaspie was not then posted to Iraq. She was stationed in the
                    Department at the time. And of course, Secretaries of State Shultz and Baker
                    came through Rome often - and never failed to visit the Pope as well as the
                    Italian government officials.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt just a moment now. When these special
                        VIPs, like Presidents and Vice Presidents and Secretaries of State, come to
                        visit, your embassy was invaded.You are a very small Embassy; how could you
                        possibly support them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, when we had such visits, we naturally worked very closely with our
                    Embassy to the Italian Republic. Embassy Rome handled all the transportation for
                    the visitors as well as security outside of Vatican City State itself. We simply
                    took care of things inside the Vatican - including the Papal heliport which is
                    located within the Vatican gardens. I recall that the President Reagan landed
                    there twice. For a small post like ours, Bill, I assure you it was no easy
                    task!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Security?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Security, yes. Of course, once inside Vatican City, we had to handle
                    everything; our people had to do it all. Our own Regional Security staff worked
                    with the Papal security service, the Swiss Guards and the Secret Service. We
                    also had a contingent of 12 U.S. Marine guards at the Embassy, you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I guess I forgot to mention this fact. We did have our own Marine
                    Security Guard contingent as well as Italian security personnel. The Marines
                    were well housed in the new Chancery on Via Aurelia. Following their arrival, I
                    spoke with the Commander of the Papal Swiss Guards, Co. Roland Buchs, and
                    arranged for a social exchange between the Swiss Guards and our Marines. It
                    worked very well - with the Guards coming to our Embassy for Friday night “Happy
                    Hour” in the Marine quarters - and our Marines frequently visiting the Swiss
                    Guard mess within Vatican City for great home-cooked meals. I also arranged with
                    the Marines for Colonel Buchs to make an official visit to the Marine Commandant
                    in Washington. This was certainly a “first” - since the only official contact
                    that the Pope's Swiss Guards ever had with a foreign military group was with the
                    U. S. Marines at our Embassy. No other diplomatic mission had military guards -
                    and, of course, they had nothing do in an official way with the Italian Armed
                    Forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>When I left Rome, I believe we had about 18 people on our staff in total. But as
                    you say, for a large Presidential visit or other official visit which involved
                    an Advance Team, we had to rely on Embassy Rome for considerable assistance - -
                    especially carting the mob of White House strap hangers around the city!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On visits of that order, the Embassy not only was
                        involved, but was also a co-sponsor, if you will, of the visit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you mentioned the personality of the Pope, of John
                        Paul II.....this Polish Pope we have. Was the Pope already installed when
                        you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh yes, he was well installed by the time I arrived in Rome! The shooting
                    of the Pope - in St. Peter's Square by the Turk - had also occurred before I
                    arrived at the Embassy in 1984. As a result of the terrorist attack, the Pope
                    did have a permanent disfiguration of his left hand. Because one of the bullets
                    entered his stomach, the Pope also had difficulty standing straight. Much of his
                    stomach, of course, was removed following the incident.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be very vital, we hear of these great tragedies that
                        happen to people. Did you observe any direct effect, were you aware that
                        this particular act carried out by the Turk had any evident effect on the
                        Pope?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well - the attack certainly had an effect on John Paul's physical
                    well-being. That was for sure, because he subsequently walked with sort of a
                    stoop. A shooting of that violence must also have had a psychological side as
                    well - but that was less evident from my vantage point in Rome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he hurting, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I really don't know, Bill. In public, at times, he certainly looked as if
                    he was in pain. I would often see him in St. Peters at a public ceremony -
                    reading his homily - with his head bent down over the text. And of course his
                    small finger and ring finger on his left hand are quite of paralyzed as a direct
                    result of the shooting. One of the bullets smashed that part of his hand - -
                    broke the bones. I also presume that it affected the Pope in a psychological
                    manner - as an attempted assassination naturally would do.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>Bill - let me give you a brief anecdote to demonstrate John Paul II's more human
                    qualities....of which he has many. This Pope is a very controversial figure;
                    beloved throughout the world and perhaps the most widely known person in the
                    world. He is certainly the most traveled Pontiff in history. This Pope, however,
                    is also viewed by many as super-conservative in today's world. Many people,
                    especially in Italy, believe John Paul II is out of touch with the reality of
                    life as it is lived in our times. People severely criticize his conservative
                    bent; yet, others criticize him because they feel the Church has become too
                    liberal under his reign - in the 25 years since the Second Vatican Council. I
                    know it will be hard to believe, but I have seen some of his strongest critics
                    right in the Vatican - and most of them were Italian!</p>
                <p>In order to begin to understand the mind of this Polish Pope, we must remember
                    that John Paul II is very Polish. He was educated and grew up ....and worked
                    .....under a Polish Communist regime which was not only anti-religious from the
                    core but actively atheistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he survived it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That he did. John Paul II is a survivor - for sure! As a youth, he worked
                    in the mines and in a factory to further his education at the university - and
                    later at the seminary. You must understand what it's like to be a cleric in
                    Poland at the time of the Communist regime. The Polish people are usually devout
                    Catholics. The Polish clergy is very respected. I imagine that the respect shown
                    to the Polish clergy is similar to that in Ireland at the turn of the century.
                    Things have changed in Ireland - - and are, no doubt, fast changing in Poland
                    today with the advent of a democratic society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very authoritarian maybe, very paternal?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Without a doubt - authoritarian. The historic cultural ties of the Roman
                    Catholic Church and the Polish nation are well known. It is a well known fact
                    that the clergy was a great source of information for the Polish people during
                    the years of Communist rule. They imparted information which the government
                    attempted to keep from the general public. I had a personal experience with that
                    when I visited Warsaw and Krakow in the late 1970s on an official mission (an
                    Inspection) together with Stan Carpenter from the State Department. One Sunday
                    we attended Mass at the Cathedral in Warsaw. We didn't understand a word, of
                    course, as the service was entirely in Polish.... but during the sermon of the
                    young celebrant, the entire congregation started talking, with rather angry
                    looks on their faces. It was obvious that they were shocked by something he had
                    said. Coming out of the church, I asked a young student in French what in the
                    world was going on.. He replied, “Well, we learned just today that two weeks ago
                    a Russian personnel carrier crashed into a bus full of school children out in a
                    mountain town - pushing them to their deaths down the side of a mountain! The
                    Russian soldier-driver was dead drunk - but not a word of this tragedy was
                    published in the press. To think that this happened only about 40 kms from
                    Warsaw - and no one knew about it!</p>
                <p>So - you see, Bill: the Polish people for years have depended on the Church as a
                    source of information; as a defender of their civil rights - and, in turn, the
                    people have shown loyalty to their priests. As I mentioned, it is rather akin
                    Ireland - or the Province of Quebec in Canada - during the last century! This
                    the sort of background from which the Pope comes. He is not at all used to the
                    empty churches in Italy or in France. The “faithful” are expected to show
                    respect - and obey! He is quite used to clerics being listened to - with
                    respect...back in Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't the Pope also an artistic and literary man as well.
                        He isn't “just a priest.” He was someone with talent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I believe that the Pope is a person of great talent. He is an
                    accomplished writer as well - as an actor. He is a first rate theologian. He is
                    also an avid sportsman; skier and boatsman. He loves hiking in the mountains -
                    and, to some extent, continues his hiking in the Italian mountains each summer,
                    in spite of the constraints of the Vatican protocol. He also continues his
                    swimming in the summer months in his pool at Castel Gandolfo.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>I'll tell you another anecdote will illustrate John Paul II's good humor and
                    powers of observation. This story concerns visit of Robert (”Bud”) McFarlane
                    (National Security Advisor for President Ronald Reagan) to the Pope - - one of
                    several he made while I was in Rome. McFarlane was sent to Rome following a
                    Summit Meeting in Geneva with Secretary General Gorbachev. The President went on
                    to Brussels to brief chiefs of state and heads of government at NATO
                    Headquarters. He sent McFarlane to Rome to brief the Holy Father regarding his
                    meeting with the Soviet leader. While we were waiting outside the Papal Library,
                    I took the opportunity of reminding Mr. McFarlane that the Pope's native
                    language was not English - as he well knew - and I thought the Pope would
                    understand him better if he used simple language and spoke slowly - when
                    explaining such complex subjects as the Strategic Defense Initiative. McFarlane
                    agreed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter - wouldn't an interpreter normally be used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, there was no interpreter since the Pope does speak and understand
                    English. But - to tell the truth, Bill, English really is not the Pope's best
                    language. An interpreter is used at such meetings only when the Pope doesn't
                    understand a word of his visitor's language. He himself gets by in about 8
                    languages. McFarlane and I were invited into the Pope's Library.</p>
                <p>(As an aside - you might think it strange that I - and not Ambassador Wilson -
                    accompanied this visitor from the White House. Well - early on in my posting I
                    was told at the Secretariat of State in the Vatican that it was appropriate for
                    the Ambassador to accompany only the President, the Vice President or the
                    Secretary of State to meetings with the Pope. They suggested that I accompany
                    all others. The reason for this - never stated explicitly, of course - was that
                    the Vatican wanted to cut down the media attention of the United States at the
                    Vatican. Mr. Wilson was very frequently in the European and American press in
                    those days - and not all of the coverage was favorable!)</p>
                <p>So....as I explained, I asked Bud McFarlane to speak slowly, not to use
                    colloquial terms or complicated vocabulary. McFarlane is very bright, as you
                    know, but not at all a warm-fuzzy personality! It turned out to be an
                    extraordinarily long Audience - lasting about 40 minutes in total.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many were you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: There were just the three of us: the Holy Father, Mr. McFarlane and
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Pope didn't have somebody on his side?....a note
                        taker?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No, he didn't. There is a secretary in the area - but he always remained
                    outside of the papal Library. A couple of times, he would stick his head in to
                    see how things were progressing - - but I gathered it was a signal to the Pope
                    to indicate “times is up!”. People are waiting!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the Pope has to do his own “minutes” afterward?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. I guess he would have dictated a report - - if any report of the
                    meeting was kept by the Vatican. Knowing how things work there - I presume that
                    the meeting was recorded....somehow! As I said, this particular meeting was
                    indeed interesting - and the Pope listened attentively to everything McFarlane
                    had to say about nuclear proliferation, arms reduction and statistics on how
                    much each side had, human rights violations by the Soviet Union.... and all the
                    minute details of the recent Summit Meeting. About 20 minutes into the
                    dialogue....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Pope asking questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was rather a monologue.... on McFarlane's part but, from time to time,
                    the Pope asked a couple of questions. At one point, the Pope interrupted and
                    said, “Mr. McFarlane, would you mind if I asked the Minister a question in
                    Italian?” Mr. McFarlane said, “No, not at all.” The Pope looked straight at me
                    and says in Italian, “Mi dica una cosa, Signor Ministro..... questo tizio soride
                    mai? What the Pope literally said to me was “Tell me, Mr. Minister, does this
                    guy ever smile?” He actually used the Italian colloquial expression for the word
                    “guy,” which is “tizio”. I was rather amazed by the Pope's question and.... just
                    looked at him and said: “No lo so, Santita'" ....”I don't know, Your Holiness. I
                    haven't seen any evidence of it yet.” And he said, “Well.....you just wait,
                    toward the end of this meeting, I'm going to tell a joke and we'll see if we can
                    get him to smile.”</p>
                <p>So. with that, the Pope asked me a technical question which I translated. I'm
                    sure McFarlane thought he took an awful long time to ask this question in
                    Italian because we had gone on so long. He answered the questions for the Pope
                    and the briefing continued. Toward the end, the Pope did tell a joke..... quite
                    a funny joke - actually..... and McFarlane kind of grinned. As we were leaving
                    the Papal Library, McFarlane walked out in front of me, the Pope was beside me.
                    The Pope grabbed my arm and leaned over and said in my ear - “Ha visto? L'ho
                    fatto!!!” “Did you see that? I did it, didn't I.” I didn't know what to say -
                    except: “Bravo, Santita'" “Well done, Your Holiness.” I never did say a word to
                    McFarlane about this incident - but, you will admit, it does show that the Pope
                    has a sense of humor!</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>I tell you this, Bill, to show you ( and others who will read this) that the Pope
                    is indeed a very human person. I saw several examples of his humanity in my
                    years of working at the Vatican. Often when I would accompany a visitor to the
                    Pope during the winter months, the Pope would ask if I had gone skiing the
                    previous weekend. He wanted to know the condition of the snow; what kind of ski
                    boots I had; my opinion on the best places to ski near Rome. In the four years I
                    was in Rome, the Pope made three trips to the mountains around Rome - with his
                    trusted secretary - to ski for a day - or a weekend. In addition, he once
                    visited the Dolomites in northern Italy for four days - with President Pertini
                    of Italy. There - he skied and Pertini watched!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If the Pope can't be human, then I want to be something
                        else! So what you're saying is, in summary, with this example: the present
                        Pope was not only a person from a different civilization than we are
                        accustomed to with Popes in general....but very much so! He is the first
                        Polish Pope, coming out a Communist setting. But he was also very
                        human.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. And, of course, this was to the great consternation of some very
                    stuffy, protocol-minded Italian prelates in the Vatican. They did not like the
                    informality of this Polish Pope at all....and made no bones about telling you
                    so. A Pope having luncheon and dinner guests....and leaving the Vatican in the
                    evening to dine at various universities and religious houses around the city!!
                    ....simply unheard of just a few short years ago. Can you picture Pius XII
                    (Eugenio Pacelli) conducting his life in such a manner in the mid-''50s?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he had a Polish grouping around him, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh yes, very much so. There was what we in the diplomatic corps always
                    referred to as a “a Polish Mafia” in all sections of the Vatican operation. They
                    were usually Polish clerics - and the Papal household was run by a group of
                    Polish nuns. They were rather stern looking - as I remember. I would often see
                    them shopping in the early morning hours at the Vatican commissary - where we
                    diplomats were also allowed to shop. All the goods were tax free - that the
                    Vatican Pharmacy is considered one of the best - and most complete - in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he could have, perhaps for his sanity and maintenance
                        of his personality, a similar culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I am sure that is the reason. It is like a Democratic President bringing
                    all his friends and supporters to Washington following a change of
                    Administration!</p>
                <p>All the Pope's original writing, for example, is done in Polish...although his
                    French and German are really very good - - much better than his spoken
                    English.</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The Pope continues to write - but I don't know where he finds the time!
                    As a matter of fact, I just read in this morning's paper that John Paul II has
                    written a book based on questions submitted to him by Italian journalists which
                    will soon be published in the United States The article I read mentioned that
                    the Pope had written the original in Polish.....and then it was translated into
                    Italian.....and then into English.</p>
                <p>I should mention that just before I left Rome, I was made a Knight Commander of
                    the Order of Pius IX (Ordine Piano) by Pope John Paul II. This Papal honor was
                    given to me in recognition of the work I had done in establishing the first
                    United States Embassy at the Holy See and “ in fostering excellent relations
                    between the two governments”. As is usual in such cases, in Washington the
                    Office of Protocol and the office of the Secretary of State had to approve my
                    acceptance of the honor. I obtained all the necessary permissions to keep the
                    decoration from the States Department. Interestingly, months later in
                    Washington, I received a call from George Vest, then Director General of the
                    Foreign Service to confirm that I had indeed requested - and received - the
                    Department's permission before accepting the Papal decoration. George said he
                    had received a few cables and letters from colleagues asking if my award had
                    indeed received the approval of the Secretary of State! Vest said that one
                    ambassador asked if the award was a “religious or civilian” decoration! I relate
                    this incident to illustrate the point I made at the opening of this interview -
                    our Mission at the Holy See is not approved by all Americans - either within the
                    government or by private citizens!</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, we're going to move on to Bonn, German - Peter. This
                        was a normal transfer to Germany, was it not? Ambassador Vernon A. Walters
                        wasn't calling for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No. But I should tell you that when the job of Minister-Counselor for
                    Consular Affairs opened in Bonn - and was proposed to me by Personnel in
                    Washington - Ambassador Vernon A. Walters called me to urge me to take the job.
                    He told me that he had been named ambassador to Germany - although the news was
                    not yet public - and that he hoped we could work together in Bonn. I - however -
                    was not at all fully convinced that I would like the job: I knew no German - and
                    thus had to go to the FSI German program prior to traveling to Bonn - not an
                    easy thing when you are over 50 years of age! I had never worked with Germans
                    before and wondered how much it would differ from the Latinos I had worked with
                    most of my entire professional life. I soon found out that there was a GREAT
                    difference - and I'll say for the record that I much preferred the Latin way of
                    working and doing business! I found it to be much more humane. However - I did
                    like working with Ambassador Walters and the staff at Embassy Bonn. By that
                    time, I had come to know Dick Walters quite well. Also - the position of Consul
                    General - and Minister Counselor for Consular Affairs at Embassy Bonn had great
                    possibilities as with the job came jurisdiction over all consular work in the
                    nation - including the Mission in Berlin..... so I took the job. Also - for the
                    record - there were no other jobs available within that time frame for an
                    officer of my grade!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In regard to consular affairs? If I can belabor this
                        point, you did not supervise in any way the Consulates General in
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, not at all. I had direct supervision over the consular sections of
                    Hamburg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Munich, and Berlin.....but not the Consulates
                    Generals per se. I lived in Bonn and traveled frequently to all of the posts
                    around Germany. In Bonn we lived in what was referred to as the “Golden Ghetto”
                    on the banks of the Rhine River in a small town named Bad Godesberg - just down
                    the Rhine from Bonn. I must admit that I found working and living in Germany to
                    be quite unlike anything I'd ever experienced in my years of service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean it was orderly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was all orderly all right, Bill .....but a bit too orderly for me! The
                    thing I objected to most was the fact that we all lived together in this ghetto.
                    Now - - I fully realize that after World War II there was no housing for the
                    huge contingent of Americans that came to this small town of Bonn (Bad
                    Godesberg). Something had to be done to house the Americans. The Germans built
                    very large and beautiful apartments in which about 500 American families were
                    housed. We were assigned to one of the three separate houses (reserved for
                    Ministers of the Embassy) on the property - - with very large gardens going all
                    the way to the Rhine River banks. The entrance to this compound was blocked by
                    German and American guards because of the security situation at the time. No one
                    - German or American - could get past the entrance gate without a permit.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then - it really was a ghetto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was indeed a ghetto. No Germans lived inside...at that time. I believe
                    that now (1996) - with the impending move of the Embassy from Bonn to Berlin -
                    the Embassy is selling off some of our government property in Bonn. The only
                    Germans that I knew during my two years in Germany were those with whom I had
                    struck up acquaintances before being posted to Bonn. I did meet some people in
                    the Foreign Ministry, but it was rather like working in Washington. It was all
                    business - and there was never any socializing or human contact of any kind.
                    Near our house, we had a Post Exchange, a Commissary, base ball fields, soft
                    ball fields, Little League fields, an American School, a New England style
                    church serving the three major faiths - and, I believe, the only church in the
                    Department of State's inventory!! We had a huge American Club - with a pool,
                    tennis courts, and restaurant - with lobsters flown in from New England once a
                    month! There was even a German Post Office - marked Deutsche Bundespost - but
                    also indicated in English - in case you missed the point!! In spite of the fine
                    living conditions - I really did not like the assignment to Germany - with one
                    great exception - - - we lived through the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall
                    of the Democratic Republic of Germany. This was indeed a historic period and one
                    which both Jackie and I found fascinating. We took full advantage of being in
                    Germany by traveling to Berlin during those crucial days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your colleagues in the diplomatic corps in Bonn, your
                        fellow consuls general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: We did not have the same rapport that I found in other countries, Bill.
                    It wasn't like being in Genoa in the consular corps, or in Nice, or in
                    Argentina. We did have some acquaintances among fellow diplomats but in no way
                    was it a close-knit corps.</p>
                <p>It was very pleasant living in Bonn; it was very clean, very orderly and we
                    couldn't have asked for better housing. Bonn was a wonderful physical location
                    for us because of the fact that my wife, who is French, has some relatives in
                    nearby Luxembourg. My mother-in-law is Luxembourgeoise. It was only a two hour
                    drive to Luxembourg City, so we often visited that country. We did discover
                    wonderful towns in the area of Bonn and along the Rhine.... great restaurants
                    (not as great as in France - but not bad!!) and historic sites. We often went
                    off with Ambassador Walters and his military aid, Comdr. Lee Martiny, on gourmet
                    expeditions to Belgium, right next door, or over the border into Holland. We'd
                    drive over to Belgium after work, as a matter of fact, to a two star restaurant
                    in Liege for a great meal!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this in part, perhaps, reflect the German problem of
                        having set up a new capital, so to speak, in a little, tiny town and having
                        authority over huge land mass. Speaking from the Embassy in Bonn - - the
                        power is really in Frankfurt, or in Hamburg, and those American Consuls
                        General act that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>MURPHY: You are absolutely right, Bill. The Consulates within the country were
                    far more active and important than Consulates in most European countries. Bonn
                    was not Paris - and people in the provinces - in provincial capitols far more
                    important than Bonn - never let you forget this fact. This will all change now,
                    of course, with the German capital moving to Berlin. It will take years to
                    accomplish - and many billions of Marks - but it will be done! Even with Berlin
                    as the capital, however, I suspect that Munich, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stuttgart
                    will always remain important and powerful centers within Germany</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And eastern Germany is existing as an entity, if you will,
                        and a capital's split, Berlin, caused an inability to act like a
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Right, exactly. All this had a part to play in how our Embassy operated
                    and what responsibilities I had in the country - - and the reaction of our
                    constituent posts to our directives....! Our Embassy is still located in Bonn,
                    and did you notice that when President Clinton visited there this past weekend,
                    that's one of the things he promised in his public speech, that by 1998 we will
                    have opened our Embassy in Berlin. At the moment we have a Branch Office of the
                    Embassy located in Berlin - at the site of the former Mission in that city.</p>

                        did see it a couple of months ago, right by where he spoke, just to the
                        right of it, in that No Man's Land.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: You mean President Kennedy spoke.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That little plot was in No Man's Land. There is a plaque
                        dedicated by the last Under Secretary of State, he was maybe Acting
                        Secretary at the time, I can't remember his name, under the Bush
                        Administration just before the end of the Bush Administration, saying “This
                        is the site of our past and future Embassy.” That's all there i- a
                        plaque.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The reason for the that: The German government has insisted we rebuild
                    our future embassy in exactly the same spot where the former one stood. I recall
                    having attended several meetings with Foreign Office officials who insisted that
                    we re-construct the embassy on exactly the same spot in Berlin!</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>It was truly a fascinating time to be in Germany. The unification of the two
                    German nations. Jackie and I visited East Germany (the German Democratic
                    Republic) a few weeks before the wall fell. In Dresden one would have thought
                    the planes of World War II had left only last week - such was the state of
                    disrepair of the public buildings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the unification? What were your
                        dates again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I was there during the unification. 1989 to the end of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, two years. Interestingly enough, Ambassador Walters predicted in his
                    first staff meeting in Bonn that during his tenure as ambassador the Berlin Wall
                    would fall. He gave many historical reasons why he thought this would come
                    about. I must say 90% of the people in the staff meeting thought he was speaking
                    through his hats!. They were not convinced this would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He even made a speech that became public on this subject
                        and had everybody shaken up. You were there, but I was here in Washington. I
                        remember thinking, “What is that man doing?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, yes. Washington was very upset with him...especially the White House.
                    But it was an interesting time. I remember that my wife and I - and also our
                    youngest son, Marc, - traveled from Berlin to Bonn - through the German
                    Democratic Republic - with Ambassador Walters on his private railway train. The
                    Ambassador received special permission from the Russians to return by train
                    during daylight hours to Bonn from Berlin. Night travel was usually insisted
                    upon by the Russians - so that it was more difficult for the travelers to make
                    out the depressing scenery of the East German countryside.</p>

                    were authorized to use, and I believe it was the only time Dick Walters used it.
                    It was a “perk” of ambassadorial rank! The train itself was simply splendid! I
                    can't begin to imagine how much our little trip from Bonn to Berlin - and return
                    - cost the German taxpayers. The train represented the last of the last vestige
                    of the “Spoils of the Victor” of the Second World War. There were four private
                    sleeping compartment-rooms, if one wished to nap. We had a communications car as
                    well as a lovely dining car with a large table seating twelve. There was a
                    French chef aboard who prepared fantastic meals for us. It seemed as if we
                    stopped every half hour or so in order that the Soviet and East German guards
                    could check our special passage documents. They were not exactly visas - but
                    represented permission from the Soviet Minister in Berlin for the American
                    Minister in Berlin and his party to pass freely through the German Democratic
                    Republic. Photographing, of course, from the train was strictly forbidden!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Walters was, am I correct, technically in
                        charge of Berlin and the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Ambassador Walters' title in Berlin was United States Minister in Berlin,
                    administering the city of Berlin together with his French, British, and the
                    Soviet colleagues. Those four Ambassadors all had the added title of Minister in
                    Berlin. The Soviet quarter of the city was, of course, in East Berlin. So - the
                    Soviet Ambassador to the GDR was Minister there as well. Ambassador Walters - as
                    the American Minister in Berlin - and as such had a separate residence in Berlin
                    and also a separate staff at the United States Mission. The German government
                    paid all the expenses of all four missions in the city - - and, after seeing how
                    the staff lived and worked - the Germans must have paid a fortune each year!! We
                    also had an American Embassy in East Berlin itself - as the capitol of the
                    German Democratic Republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then under Walters came the Military Commander of
                        Berlin?</hi>

                <p>MURPHY: Yes</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the ambassador was the boss in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: He was the boss in Berlin. Often when I had visits in Berlin, I would
                    stay at his fully staffed Berlin residence. The ambassador was very generous in
                    this regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all of this, Peter, I hate to remind you that you
                        were only the Consul General.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I was only the Consul General - and Minister of Embassy for Consular
                    Affairs..</p>

                        Germany.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Professionally. ....well, one of the major consular events during my tour
                    was the introduction of the “Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) Waiver” for Germans
                    visiting the United States. In order to cut down on NIV work in Western Europe,
                    the Congress passed a regulation which stipulated that nations whose citizens
                    did not overstay their temporary visits in our country would no longer be
                    required to hold U. S. tourist visas to enter the United States. You can imagine
                    the cut-back in NIV workloads at our posts throughout Europe as a result of this
                    new regulation!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Determined by low incidence of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Low incidence of overstay. There were certain prerequisites before a
                    country could be put on this “Visa Waiver List” that would eliminate the
                    necessity of obtaining a visa to travel to the United States. I arrived in Bonn
                    about two weeks before this directive came from Washington. I had to devise ways
                    of educating the German public that a visa was no longer necessary. This seems
                    like a rather simple task. However - I soon discovered differently! Germans like
                    authority and they like permissions, visa stamps and seals! To convince them
                    that they no longer would be turned away at our borders if they did not have an
                    American visa in their passports was a major effort - involving the mounting of
                    a huge Television, Radio and media campaign. I gave press conferences throughout
                    the country - and we organized the effort through all the consulates as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Control.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Germans do like control; in fact, I would say that they love control. So,
                    Bill, although we took to the airwaves, had television programs as well as
                    seminars for German travel agents, it took many months before the lines of visa
                    applicants diminished in front of the consulates in Germany. I must say that
                    Marsha Barnes, the Chief of the Consular Section in Bonn was of great assistance
                    in this program. Marsha is an experienced and very capable consular officer who
                    is fluent in German....as opposed to me - - most unfortunately!</p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>I should perhaps mention an interesting “political perspective” to this Visa
                    Waiver initiative. Shortly after the Visa Waiver directive arrived from
                    Washington, I was called to the Foreign Ministry in downtown Bonn and told in no
                    uncertain terms: “The Federal Republic would like Washington to be aware of the
                    fact that if this new Visa Waiver applies to the Federal Republic of Germany it
                    must apply to ALL Germans. By that we mean anyone possessing a German Passport.”
                    What they were getting at, of course, was the fact that the German Constitution
                    recognizes citizens of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as German citizens.
                    In their eyes all Germans - from West or East - are to be treated alike. You can
                    imagine the consternation this caused the FBI and the CIA and other members of
                    our intelligence community. Imagine: an East German escapes to the Federal
                    Republic and, after obtaining a German passport, hops on the next plane in
                    Frankfurt and shows up in New York .....without ever having passed through any
                    type of visa look-out computer check at an Embassy or Consulate!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hadn't this been thought through ahead of time? Weren't we
                        aware of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I am sure it was, Bill. However, the Germans wanted us to be fully aware
                    of the fact that they would not tolerate any German being treated as a “second
                    class German”. The message was delivered not only to me in Bonn but that same
                    day the DCM of the Embassy in Washington delivered the same message to the State
                    Department. They certainly wanted to cover all bases!</p>
                <p>Our position within Consular Affairs was that we absolutely had to respect the
                    German Constitution and that there is no way we can say that East Germans could
                    not come to the United States under this “waiver authority” if they had valid
                    West German passports.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Let's see.....well, I'll tell you about one interesting evening in
                    Germany. Ambassador Walters and I are both members of the Sovereign Military
                    Order of Malta. We entered into the Order on the same date - in New York City at
                    St. Patrick's Cathedral.......together with General Al Haig. This Order,
                    originally founded in 1099 to assist pilgrims and to protect the Christian
                    territory recaptured by the Crusaders in Jerusalem, is - since 1834 - now
                    headquartered in Rome in the Malta Palace on the Via Condotti. It is, in effect,
                    an international charitable organization. The seat of the Order - as well as a
                    large Villa on the Aventino Hill in Rome - is considered to be
                    “extra-territorial” land by the government of Italy. In view of the sovereignty
                    of the Order and under the provisions of International Law and the Treaty of
                    Vienna, the Order of Malta is recognized by some nations as a separate State
                    and, as such, maintains diplomatic relations with about 26 nations in addition
                    to several international bodies (UNESCO, FAO, Council of Europe, the Arab
                    League). In 1994 the General Assembly of the United Nations granted the Order
                    the status of Observer at the General Assembly - following receipt of a
                    resolution signed by 71 nations. Today, the Order is dedicated to providing
                    assistance in charitable and social fields - and in particular, aids those
                    stricken by natural disaster and to the casualties of war. There are about 1,700
                    members of this Order in the United States.</p>
                <p>To give you some idea of the Order's “behind the scene” work in humanitarian
                    causes: the Order provided material assistance to those East Germans fleeing to
                    West Germany through Hungary and Austria. Some years ago - following the war in
                    Vietnam the Knights of Malta - working through other governments provided the
                    funds to build hospitals and clinics for the Vietnamese war victims.</p>
                <p>While I was in Rome, I frequently met with the Prince and Grand Master of the
                    Order - Angelo de Mojana di Cologna -as well as member of his staff to discuss
                    humanitarian assistance in various parts of the world. This information was
                    passed to Washington and was useful to the Agency for International Development
                    (A.I.D.) and other parts of the government. I often met with the “Hospitalier”
                    of the Order - whose office directed much of the charitable work. At the time,
                    he was a young German Baron from a very wealthy family - Freiherr Albrecht von
                    Boeselager. He spent about a week a month in Rome, residing permanently with his
                    family not far from Bonn. Jackie and I, together with Ambassador Walters, were
                    invited by von Boeselager and his wife to a dinner at his home (Schloss
                    Kreuzberg in Kreuzberg/Ahr) together with several of the German officials of the
                    Knights of Malta. Many of these men were leaders in their professional fields -
                    and quite well-healed, as you can imagine! During the evening, some of them
                    explained how they raised funds and sent aid to the East Germans who were
                    temporarily refugees in Hungary. The Order actually passed funds to their
                    Hungarian counterparts - and a refugee camp was built for the German refugees in
                    record time. It was most interesting to learn these facts firsthand. This flood
                    of East German refugees can truly be considered to be the those who opened the
                    floodgates of the Communist Empire.</p>

                <p>MURPHY: Yes - the beginning of the end, as it were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us, Peter, a bit about your relationships to the

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The constituent posts. I can assure you that a lot of my time was take
                    with administrative matters involving these posts! We had a number of personnel
                    problems involving both Germans and Americans - and somehow I frequently found
                    myself in the middle of these delicate problems! My relationships with all the
                    Consuls General were very good. Some of them had enormous egos, I must say. You
                    can imagine, Bill - with the size of the offices in Frankfurt - or Munich!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would argue all, but....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, I don't think Harry Gilmore did .....the Minister in Berlin, for
                    example. I was very impressed by the operations of Frankfurt, which is an
                    enormous post. It is larger than any of our embassies in Africa. I was also
                    impressed with the work of our Consulate General in Munich. I think Bavaria is
                    perhaps the most interesting part of Germany, from my point of view. I think the
                    people are more human....at least I found that I related better to the
                    Bavarians. Although I must say that both my wife and I were really astounded on
                    our first visit to the city of Hamburg. It is truly a beautiful city - the art,
                    the architecture - - the overall elegance of the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a strong city in the sense of a port that is
                        centuries old. Your tour in Germany was only two years, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It was only two years. At the end of that period I was assigned to
                    Washington ....just at the start of the Gulf War in Kuwait and Iraq! Miss
                    Elizabeth Tamposi - Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs (and the only
                    Assistant Secretary of State ever fired personally by a President of the United
                    States!) asked me if I would take over as the Consular Affairs Director of the
                    Gulf War Task Force which had been set up on a 24-hour-a-day basis. Ambassador
                    Mary A. Ryan, former Ambassador to Swaziland and present (1996) Assistant
                    Secretary for Consular Affairs, was the overall Director of the task force from
                    the political perspective. Mary is presently (1998) Assistant Secretary of State
                    for Consular Affairs - and one of the most popular AS the Bureau has ever
                    had.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Ms. Elizabeth Tamposi was then the Assistant Secretary for Consular
                    Affairs. While stationed in Bonn, I had heard several tales of her initial days
                    in Consular Affairs! At the end of my tour there, I received a call from CA
                    asking if I would consider taking the position as Ms. Tamposi's Senior Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary. With no hesitation at all - I declined the offer. Q: You
                    might be a little bit more specific since it's quite public....... awareness of
                    Ms. Tamposi's role, including the firing by the President. What was part of her
                    problem at that time?</p>
                <p>MURPHY: Ms. Tamposi, I believe, was a woman much removed from her element in her
                    position at the State Department. I had spoken with her by phone a few time from
                    Bonn. I knew that she had, in effect, fired Mary Ryan from her position as
                    Tamposi's Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senior Deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. As a matter of fact, Mary asked me why I hadn't taken the job when
                    it was offered to me. I told her that I found working with Mr. Wilson and Mr.
                    Shakespeare, the two political appointees at the Vatican, very stressful. The
                    high visibility of the White House, the constant intrigues, and the continual
                    walking of the fine line between the State Department and the White House
                    required great skill - as well as enormous physical stamina! At this point in my
                    career - as I was contemplating retirement - I didn't want to get involved with
                    that again. I knew it would be the same old routine: Tamposi was the prot�g� of
                    the Chief of Staff at the White House, John Sununu. The reason for this
                    connection: Tamposi's father - a very successful N. H. contractor - was Sununu's
                    chief financial backer in New Hampshire! Her background was that of the state
                    legislator who had lost her second term in an election. She then turned to
                    Daddy's real estate firm. Her father was a very wealthy real estate developer in
                    New Hampshire and Florida. Betty Tamposi, as you know Bill, had no experience
                    whatsoever in management, in international affairs, or the Washington scene.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And stories had already begun about some of her
                        idiosyncrasies.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, idiosyncrasies!When I came back to Washington, I returned with a
                    very open mind. I said, “I'm here in Washington for another five months before I
                    retire.” Naturally, the Gulf War Task Force was under Betty Tamposi's
                    jurisdiction, her bailiwick - since it involved the protection of American life
                    and property abroad. Tamposi knew this was where the publicity was, where it was
                    in those days at least, so she naturally wanted to be directly involved. After
                    working a week for her, I sat down with Betty and talked very openly. First of
                    all, I told her the reason I hadn't taken the job she had offered me. She then
                    asked me, “Why are people around here so upset that I fired Mary Ryan?” I told
                    her point blank, “You fired the most distinguished and respected woman
                    Ambassador we have today in the Foreign Service. She is respected and greatly
                    admired by her peers throughout the world. No one can understand your actions in
                    throwing her out of your office. They presume it is a matter of professional
                    jealousy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a very professional person as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Sure sh is! I gave examples of Mary's professional background. I
                    continued to tell Betty, “...And people think basically that it's professional
                    jealousy. You're jealous of a competent professional woman.” She was very sorry
                    and, of course, upset to hear that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she take it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: She took from me...... and the reason she had to was that nothing she
                    could do to influence my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd already turned down her offer as her Deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, I'd already turned down that offer. Another reason I spoke so openly
                    and forcefully to Betty about this matters was because of my respect for
                    consular work - and those who work in this complex field. As you are aware,
                    Bill, much of my career was spent in and around consular matters, even though I
                    didn't spend my entire career working directly in of for the CA Bureau. I have
                    deep affection for consular work and for the officers and national staffs who
                    perform that work for the American public.</p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>At one point, Betty showed me a map on her office the wall which was full of
                    little flags - each one representing a country she had visited. She explained
                    that one of her major goals in the State Department was to visit every country
                    with which we have diplomatic relations. In an indirect way, I suggested that
                    this was most inappropriate objective for a person in her position! I said,
                    “When you go to a post to hold a conference, you should go there for the
                    specific purpose of bettering the consular image, the consular function, to make
                    the lives of consular officers easier in the field. Because of your position,
                    you can assist our Embassy in country X by cutting through red-tape at the local
                    Foreign Ministry. You should utilize your visits abroad for these purposes. They
                    are the people in those nations who need the assistance. You can see how
                    important immigration is in our nation. When tragedies occur that involve
                    Americans overseas, you have seen how important immediate Washington back-up
                    becomes. That is what your job is - - and this should be the reason you visit
                    selected diplomatic posts.”</p>
                <p>A few days later, Betty came to me and said, “Perhaps you can help me plan my
                    next trip to Europe,” and she went over her proposed itinerary with me. She was
                    planning to land in Frankfurt and go up to Bonn for a few days and then on to
                    Romania. I said, “What's the reason? Why are you going to Frankfurt?” She said,
                    “Oh, they have a machine-readable passport production there, so I'll go and look
                    at that. I'll stay a couple of hours there in Frankfurt.” I suggested that she
                    spend more time with the consular personnel in Frankfurt - one of our largest
                    consular posts in the world. I tried to impress on her the crucial importance of
                    that consulate which handled all of the medical evacuations of American citizens
                    coming from Africa, from the Middle East, hostages landing there, of the work
                    they do to coordinate all that, all the immigrant visa work, all the
                    non-immigrant visa work. In addition, I told her of the assistance the consular
                    section provides to the American military - issuing thousands of Reports of
                    Birth of American citizens; U. S. Passports; hundreds of Immigrant Visas. I told
                    her, “Without the excellent German staff, we could do nothing.” I explained how
                    important it was that she address both the American and German staffs - to
                    encourage them in their work and also to thank them for their extraordinary
                    efforts in coping with the recent spate of hostage releases from the Middle East
                    - and all the work they do to support the needs of our Armed Forces stationed in
                    Germany. She apparently understood what I was saying. When she returned from her
                    trip, however, she timidly confessed that she didn't find the time to speak with
                    the consular section personnel in Frankfurt. I found the entire experience of
                    working with Betty Tamposi most discouraging, Bill!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What more do we have to say about this woman who was fired
                        by President Bush after two and a half years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Well, I must tell you, Bill, that I had a preconceived notion of what the
                    woman was like from what I heard from my colleagues overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had not met her before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No. Before arriving in Washington from Bonn, we had never met. I did find
                    that Betty Tamposi could be very personable.....when she wanted to! But I also
                    had the feeling when speaking with her that she was always on her guard; she was
                    a bit leery of the person she was speaking with. There is no doubt that she
                    suffered from an inferiority complex. This affected her daily work and her
                    interpersonal relations with her fellow Assistant Secretaries as well as the
                    personnel throughout the Consular Affairs Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps afraid of hurt bosses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I believe Betty Tamposi was intimidated by Foreign Service professionals
                    - - by people who knew more of the work than she ....this wasn't at all
                    difficult! I remember, for example, discussing the new Visa Waiver Program when
                    we first met. A few minutes into the conversation, I quickly realized she didn't
                    have any real interest in - or knowledge of - visas or visa waivers. Her main
                    interest in me, that I could see, was my involvement with the German end of the
                    investigation of the Pan Am 103 crash in Scotland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there overriding...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: She made the PanAm 103 tragedy her “cause celebre” and stated at a large
                    press conference: “My predecessors might not have done this right, but we in
                    Consular Affairs are now going to work for the American people. My office will
                    find out who these terrorists were and why they blew up the Pan Am flight over
                    Lockerbie, Scotland. We shall see that they are punished.” As I mentioned, my
                    involvement stemmed from the fact that the investigation traced back the
                    terrorists to the International Airport in Frankfurt, so the German government
                    too became involved. Groups of relatives of the victims of the crash came to the
                    Embassy in Bonn two or three times during my tour in Germany, seeking assistance
                    in meeting with German government authorities - including the Chancellor of the
                    Republic.. They were looking into the German side of the investigation; security
                    at Frankfurt airport and related issues. It was obvious that Tamposi was very
                    interested in this subject - which could buy her TV time - - and maybe even a
                    press conference!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background? She was a lawyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No, I don't believe she was a lawyer. Following her defeat for a seat in
                    the New Hampshire Legislature, she worked in her father's real estate business
                    in Manchester.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had a political background, not academic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0182" n="Page0182"/>
                <p>MURPHY: No, no, academic background as far as I was aware. Completely political.
                    And of course, she was favored by John Sununu, the former Governor of New
                    Hampshire, whose major financial backer in the state was Betty Tamposi's father.
                    There is no doubt that she was out of her element in Washington. For Betty, the
                    job of Assistant Secretary of State was a learning experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps insecure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: You have hit the nail on the head, Bill. Betty Tamposi was indeed
                    insecure. I have heard that she was not well treated as an Assistant
                    Secretary-Designate by her predecessor - Ambassador Joan Clark. I can imagine
                    that this very fact set her off on the wrong foot at the State Department. When
                    she was confirmed by the Senate and finally assumed control of the Bureau, she
                    started to antagonize the people around her, - her immediate colleagues, the
                    people she depended on - by disregarding their advice. She purposely withheld
                    information she learned at the Secretary of State's daily Staff Meeting which
                    was vital for the conduct of consular business. But then again, it may well be
                    that she didn't fully understand what went on in those staff meetings...what was
                    important and what was not! I experienced her inability to pay attention to
                    detail while serving on the Gulf War Task Force. One day, just prior to the
                    Secretary's Staff Meeting, I explained to Betty how many military planes we were
                    sending in from Frankfurt to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to evacuate American citizens
                    as scud missiles were landing fast and furious during that period. She went to
                    the Secretary's Staff Meeting and reported that I had sent more than double the
                    number of aircraft that I had told her!! Others present at the meeting called me
                    to find out the truth. I couldn't believe that she couldn't keep simple facts
                    straight. It was the same thing when she was called upon to testify before a
                    Congressional Committee. The ordeal, at times, ended in tears!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, maybe a combination of two things: Not
                        terribly bright, as well as devious because she suspected the professionals
                        she worked with in Consular Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I think her suspicion is typical of many members of a new administration
                    coming in. Suspicious of the professionals, “the striped pants brigade” out at
                    our posts overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe she was warned about them too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I'm sure she was warned about them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mr. James Baker never had great enthusiasm for the
                        bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>MURPHY: That's true from all I have heard and read. In my dealings with Baker's
                    immediate staff, I heard several stories to confirm this. What I fault Betty
                    Tamposi for the most is her complete disregard of her responsibility to
                    represent the consular function to her peers in the State Department. As far as
                    I can determine, she did absolutely nothing to enhance the status of consular
                    officers either in Washington or abroad. She showed no appreciation whatsoever
                    for these officers who have enormous responsibility for immigration to the
                    United States, for the protection of American lives and property abroad, and who
                    work their tails off day and night to meet these objectives. How different it is
                    today with Assistant Secretary Mary A. Ryan at the helm! From what I have seen,
                    Mary rivals Barbara M. Watson in her real concern for the working conditions of
                    consular officers - as well as a real interest in their promotions to senior
                    positions of greater authority in the Foreign Service. In my view, both Barbara
                    and Mary were sincerely committed to improving and maintaining a high level of
                    service to the American public overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe this is a good place to stop for a moment, Peter, to
                        tell the reader how you look back on your total career, particularly with
                        the emphasis on the consular function. What did it all mean to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I welcome this opportunity because I have always been firmly convinced
                    that consular work is one of the most important responsibilities of the
                    Department of State today. The United States Consular Service was founded in the
                    early days of our fledgling republic - - by men of great vision who sent U. S.
                    consuls abroad for the specific purpose of protecting Americans overseas, and
                    furthering America's commercial interests. Our consular officers today are
                    carrying out the same charge throughout the world: protection is extended to the
                    young college or high school student traveling throughout the world who find
                    themselves in the midst of wars in Third World Countries or are stuck in natural
                    disasters anywhere in the world. The work of the Gulf War Task Force
                    (1990-91)was a great example of how our government protects our citizens: over
                    300 officers from throughout the Department participated in this effort to
                    protect American lives and property in a very complex and highly-charged
                    situation in Kuwait and Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us a little more about that. What types of...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>MURPHY: As I mentioned, this was the largest emergency Task Force ever assembled
                    in the history of the State Department. It was a 24-hour-a-day operation and had
                    a two-fold responsibility: political and consular. The consular branch, of
                    course, was for the protection of the hostages who were hiding. We tracked those
                    who remained in hiding from the Iraqis as well as those captured by them. We
                    were in constant communications with families back home and were able to pass
                    messages to many who were hidden in the war zone via embassies of third
                    countries here in Washington. The British, Irish, French and Germans were all
                    most helpful during that critical period of our history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after the invasion of Kuwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes. We also were responsible for the administration of a fund
                    established by the Congress for the benefit of those Americans in the area who
                    lost their jobs. The Congress at that time thought it very unjust that many of
                    the oil companies for which these Americans worked abroad cut off their salaries
                    soon after the employees were taken hostage or prisoner by the Iraqis. As a
                    result, the families back in the United States were suffering the economic
                    repercussions of such actions. Congress voted a large sum of money to compensate
                    these American citizens for their losses. It was mandated that Consular Affairs
                    administer this fund....and what a job it was!</p>

                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - exactly. Problems with the fund began almost at once. We found that
                    some of these hostage families were, in effect, double-dipping.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>But I must say, the officers who were seconded from various parts of the
                    Department, not just from Consular Affairs, but from the Economic Bureau,
                    Commercial, Political offices all over the Department came together on this Task
                    Force and worked in harmonious groups. We were in constant contact by telephone
                    with the families of the hostages in the Middle East as well as with the
                    hostages themselves. I remember my shock when the French Embassy in Washington
                    passed me three separate messages from an American citizen in hiding in Kuwait:
                    one addressed to his wife - and the other two to girlfriends! I am quite sure
                    the French had difficulty translating the very colloquial language of those
                    steamy messages!! Whenever there was news to be passed to the families, they
                    were there to do the job....even at 3:00 AM!. We put out news bulletins to help
                    the hostages' families cope with the situation - and to keep them updated on our
                    actions on their behalf. We coordinated with our Consulate General in Frankfurt
                    for the hospitalization at the Wiesbaden Air Force Hospital of those returning
                    from the war zone in the Middle East. Working with the Pentagon, we sent
                    aircraft to evacuate families in the area to Western Europe. At the height of
                    the crisis - around Christmas time - we brought ten of the hostage families
                    (mostly from Texas) to Washington to meet with President and Mrs. George Bush in
                    the White House. I remember being a bit upset when I was told by the
                    Presidential aids - “The President will meet with ten family members of
                    oil-worker hostage - - no State Department or Military hostage families! Then -
                    to add insult to injury - they told us to get the money to cover this
                    “Presidential Invitation” from Department of State financing as the White House
                    would not pay for it!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Enthusiasm comes from awareness that you are doing
                        something good for people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. Helping others, I believe, is the essence of consular work.
                    How many agencies of government - federal, state or local - do you know, Bill,
                    that helps out a citizen without a moment's delay?? This part of diplomatic work
                    encompasses that which originally attracted me to the Foreign Service. If you
                    return to the beginning of these tapes you will see that as a child I was
                    interested in the lives and cultures of people in foreign countries. Foreign
                    Service Officers have, I believe, the unique opportunity, of integrating
                    themselves more fully in a local situation, a local culture. This is true to a
                    greater extent for consular officers - who spend their entire day dealing with
                    the local population....more so than any other officer in an embassy. They have
                    the opportunity through daily contact with the man on the street who wants a
                    visa, notarial service.....wants something from our government. Consular
                    officers have the opportunity of really getting to know a society more in depth
                    than any of their colleagues.</p>
                <p>My consular experience served me well when I was assigned as Principal Officer in
                    Nice, also in Genoa and in my assignment as Minister at the Vatican. Because of
                    this experience, I had a different - and I believe - a more profound and more
                    understanding outlook on a given political situation. For example, when
                    discussing refugees problems with a Vatican official, I was able to evaluate not
                    only the political and economic consequences of the situation - but also the
                    humanitarian aspects which, after all, are often the most important.</p>
                <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                <p>As we see today, immigration is in the forefront of every political debate in our
                    nation. Every talk show on the radio, every Sunday morning television show on
                    the television today frequently have immigration as a main topic. What we'll do
                    about the flood of Haitians, about the numbers of people coming to Florida,
                    California, Texas, and the southwest United States - is an ongoing subject of
                    national debate. I believe it will continue this way for years to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it will be debated in the next elections,
                        Peter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No doubt about it! People in our country, as we know, are on both sides
                    of the question: Should we keep foreigners out of the United States - - or
                    should we let them in? We must never lose sight of the fact that we are a nation
                    built on immigration. All your forefathers, Bill, and mine as well came to the
                    United States to look for a better life. In Boston - at the time my grandparents
                    arrived at the turn of the century - there was surely a great debate over the
                    political and economic costs of such immigration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter - you are Irish in origin, no doubt ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right - Irish on my father's side and French on mother's side. You
                    are well aware of the old claims, Bill: “It's costing too much. These people are
                    a burden on the society. Educational expenses, health expenses, all the social
                    costs of absorbing these people are just tremendous. We can't take any more.
                    Let's close the doors.” This argument will never end. B.J. Harper and Cornelius
                    (Dick) Scully (of our Visa Office at State) can explain this problem much more
                    eloquently than I as they have been engaged in immigration throughout most of
                    their careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But still, the bottom line is Congress, and Congress must
                        make decisions about immigration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Our Congressional representatives should faithfully represent those who
                    elected them to office. Daily I believe that people are getting more interested
                    in the subject of immigration - and the movement of peoples. I don't know if
                    there is truth to the story, but I heard a few days ago that the Federal
                    Government has made a secret agreement with the State of Florida promising that
                    no future Cuban refugee will be settled in that State. As I said, I don't know
                    if this is true - but I can certainly understand their qualms. If Cuba blows up
                    tomorrow, and we have the same kind of refugee situation as we have in Haiti
                    today, where we have 1500 or 2000 people a day coming out of Haiti....</p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>Let me give you a little aside, Bill, that is quite topical. Yesterday, I saw a
                    good friend here in Washington. His name is Admiral Michael Kalleres. We met
                    when I was Consul in Nice, France - and Mike was Captain of a Sixth Fleet ship -
                    and visiting in the harbor of Villefranche s/Mer. Mike is now a three-star
                    Admiral and director of the Navy's Military Sea Lift Command....a tremendous
                    responsibility as all ships of our Navy fall under his jurisdiction.. I visited
                    Mike, together with the president of the company for which I now work. My firm
                    does a lot of business with the Military Sea Lift Command. In our conversation
                    yesterday, the subject of Haiti arose. Mike had returned to previous day from
                    Panama and Haiti - where he observed the interviews of Haitian refugees aboard
                    US Naval ships by INS officers. These Haitians, he said, were being questioned
                    by Creole-speaking interpreters who never translated the full reply for the
                    interviewing immigration officer. Mike said 99% of the Haitians he saw were,
                    without any doubt, economic refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The INS officer spoke only French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - no Creole language capability at all. Mike said he personally
                    observed this aboard ship. He was just aghast at the fact that the
                    Administration had used strong-armed tactics to get Panama to accept 10,000 of
                    these Haitian refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is an example of California or Texas saying, “I can't
                        pay this bill.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Sure. For all of these reasons, Bill, I think that immigration, refugee
                    matters, and consular work in general, will remain in the forefront of American
                    public opinion for many years to come. We try hard to convince other nations of
                    the world, - some of which are even more fortunate than we are - to accept some
                    of the refugees in need of a home. This whole refugee problem reminds me of my
                    days at the Vatican as well. I frequently had talks with Vatican officials about
                    refugee situations around the world - and the consequences of the movement of
                    peoples from one part of the world to another. The United States was always
                    singled out as a very fortunate and generous nation and - naturally - always
                    being encouraged to do more in this field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And we should do more - - is that the position of the
                        Vatican?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Exactly.....”to whom much is given, much is expected”. When you look
                    around at the waste..... We see it every day, Bill.</p>
                <p>By the way, in this interview I did not speak of my days in Romania. This came
                    about after my retirement to the South of France , in the town of Menton on the
                    Riviera, in January of 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes Peter. I guess we have to end your service! You
                        retired, then, after the...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I retired after the Gulf War Task Force was disbanded..... and then went
                    to reside in Menton, France where you, Bill, came to visit us on the Riviera!
                    The date of my retirement from the Department of State was January 31, 1991.
                    After two or three months of reading newspapers all day under the palm trees in
                    the sunshine of the French Riviera, I was at my wits end for lack of meaningful
                    activity! I was very glad when Barry Kefauver, Director of the Executive Office
                    of the Bureau of Consular Affairs in the Department, telephoned to ask if I
                    would consider undertaking a special mission for the Department to Bucharest,
                    Romania. He said they were “having an adoption problem” - of which, of course, I
                    was fully aware from the local French and Italian press.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you reassigned, or was this sort of a contract
                        arrangement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: No. I had officially retired from government service. This was a contract
                    arrangement - a WAE type deal! I, of course, knew something of the adoption
                    problem from the Italian and French press as it was widely reported throughout
                    Europe. In brief, the problem centered around the fact that Americans and other
                    foreigners - mainly western Europeans - were going to Bucharest, legally
                    adopting children under Romanian law then attempting to obtain Immigrant Visas
                    from our Embassy in Bucharest to return with their child to the United States.
                    As you know, our laws, allow an American couple to apply for an Immigrant Visa
                    in the name of a foreign adopted child to join the family in the United States.
                    Regulations state, however, that the child must be an “orphan” and this is where
                    the problem begins. I have to tell you , Bill, that prior to my arrival in
                    Bucharest - I had never in my life issued an Immigrant Visa in a “orphan case”.
                    Such cases are usually grouped only in those countries where such adoptions are
                    are a possibility - and I had never been assigned to such a country.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>When I arrived in Bucharest, hundreds of American adoptive parents were
                    threatening a hunger strike outside our embassy if visas were not issued to
                    their children. The story was on prime time television in Europe as well as in
                    the United States: we had all the networks - CNN, NBC, and CBS - set up outside
                    the Embassy hoping to interview some of the American adoptive American parents.
                    The stories did indeed make one's heart bleed: some of these couples had been in
                    Romania for six months; some had paid enormous sums to crooked American or
                    Romanian lawyers. I believe that the majority of the adoptive American parents
                    were sincere, honest folks seeking simply to adopt a child - and share their
                    loving home with the child. Many of the adopted children were in need of medical
                    attention and were living in conditions far from normal in a society still
                    recovering from its revolution from the Communist leaders. What was the crux of
                    the problem? The difficulty for our Embassy was the fact that many of the
                    parents had actually purchased their children from biological parents (either
                    knowingly or unknowingly) and the subsequent IV applications were, of course,
                    rejected by the Embassy. Under our law, following the refusal of the Immigrant
                    Visa to a child adopted legally but still ineligible to receive an IV, a “waiver
                    of ineligibility” had to be requested from the Attorney General (through the
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service) in order to allow the child to return to
                    the USA with the adoptive parents. As a group of officers within INS
                    headquarters in Washington was strongly was opposed to the admission of these
                    adopted children - they purposely delayed the granting of these “waivers”. Thus
                    - both the parents and children suffered. It was such a stupid move on INS' part
                    - as well as childish - since the waivers were all granted eventually. You can
                    imagine the pressures on the Embassy from the White House and the Congress at
                    this time. I don't think that I had ever before in my career spoken directly
                    with so many members of Congress over one single issue. Within the Bucharest
                    consular section, most of the officers were constantly on the phone to the
                    United States - explaining why we could not simply issue Immigrant Visas to this
                    unfortunate children. Our explanations fell on deaf ears: we were telling them
                    things they did not want to hear - our bureaucratic “mumbo- jumbo” was almost
                    unintelligible to the ordinary American citizen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was the only route that you could legally take?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That was the only route, that's correct. The Immigration people took
                    great exception to the Embassy's request for a “waiver of ineligibility” in such
                    cases. They insisted - through their offices in Vienna, Rome - and finally
                    Washington - that investigations be carried out in several cases.</p>

                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>MURPHY: What was questioned was the veracity of some of the statements made by
                    the Romanian government officials - and Romanian Courts - as well as by some of
                    the birth mothers - who were more often than not gypsy women from small villages
                    far from Bucharest. They especially questioned the fact that the child had been
                    “abandoned” by the birth mother......in accord with our laws. I believe Virginia
                    (Ginny) Young covers a lot of this in one of your interviews. Ginny was Consul
                    General in Bucharest during this active period. Her husband, Don, was a retired
                    INS officer - and was on temporary duty at the Embassy - as was I. They were a
                    very nice couple with whom I enjoyed working.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a question of fraud?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: There was a suggestion of fraud and, in many instances, there was fraud
                    involved in these adoptions. I stayed in Bucharest about three months - and
                    then, during the summer of 1991, returned again from France for about a month.
                    One of my main tasks was to attempt to convince the Romanian government to
                    establish a Romanian National Adoption Commission through which all the
                    legitimate orphans could be offered - first to native Romanians - and then to
                    foreigners. Our Embassy worked on this issue in concert with the French,
                    British, Irish, Germans and Italians - - those nations whose citizens were also
                    adopting Romanian babies in large numbers. The Romanians were convinced and
                    finally did establish such an organization. Nothing of its kind had ever existed
                    under the Communist state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other countries who were out trying to adopt
                        children too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, yes. Mainly people from Ireland, England, Italy and Germany. I worked
                    very closely with these embassies in Bucharest on the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they all had the same public problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I would say that in Germany and in Italy the public relations outcry over
                    the situation was worse that in the United States. Due to the fact that their
                    visa laws were different from ours, some nations had no problem in issuing visas
                    to adopted children who were not orphans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for three months?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>MURPHY: I worked in Romania for three months and then subsequently - from France
                    - I returned to Bucharest for another month. An old friend, Patricia Hall was
                    the Consul General in Bucharest when I returned the second time. During this
                    stint, I lived at the Bucharest Hotel in downtown Bucharest. This was a most
                    trying experience given the primitive living conditions in Romania at that time.
                    The first week that I was in the hotel, I got almost no sleep at night because
                    the place was infested with prostitutes! These women telephoned and knocked on
                    the door at all hours of the night! It was a trying period for the average
                    Romanian. The economy of the country was in shambles.</p>
                <p>The year 1991 was certainly an interesting time for me to be in Romania. It had
                    been about six years since their revolution and the country - under President
                    Ion Iliescu - didn't seem to know where it was going. There was the possibility
                    that it could develop westward - like Hungary or the Czech Republic - or it
                    could fall back into complete isolation and oppression as in the old days under
                    Communism. What I noticed most traveling around the countryside was the ever
                    present official flunkies - fat from too many potatoes and other starches and
                    dressed in the drab outfits of the Stalin era! They were everywhere! Most of the
                    ones I met seemed to be a parody of Communist Party officiousness and paranoia
                    one found in any country of the Soviet empire. But - here we were six years
                    after Romania's revolution. Not much had changed, as far as I could see. All my
                    telephone calls to my wife in France had to be placed through the Foreign
                    Ministry. The people in the streets were obviously afraid of the police - and
                    military - who were everywhere - at all hours of the day and night. I realize
                    that it is difficult to install democratic ways after over 50 years of Communist
                    rule - but the Romanians were certainly lagging behind their Eastern neighbors.
                    Typical wages were about $150 a month - so most of the imported goods available
                    in a few shops were unavailable to the ordinary worker. In Bucharest the
                    politicians I met during my initial three month stay seemed overly preoccupied
                    with the problem of the ethnic Hungarians resident in western Transylvania.
                    Everyone was very defensive about their rights - language rights as well as
                    property rights. Then again - the Gypsies seemed to be the greater problem for
                    others. There are over three million of them in the country. The Communist
                    regime had shipped three jumbo jets full back to New Delhi where - so I was told
                    - they originated centuries before they stepped foot on Romanian soil. At the
                    time of my sojourn there, our government was attempting to lure the Romanians
                    into integration with the West by tempting them with “Most Favored Nation”
                    trading status. It is absolutely necessary that Romania improve its human rights
                    record before the country is accepted fully into NATO and the European Common
                    Market. The ultranationalism existing within the country - combined with the
                    economic situation - will make Iliescu's task difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>I made the most of my stay in Romania, Bill. After spending about three weekends
                    in Bucharest - I felt I had seen what the city had to offer, It was - in its
                    heyday - a fine city with beautiful buildings and lovely gardens. The Communist
                    regime had ruined much of that - tearing down beautiful Orthodox churches and
                    private homes. These were substituted by huge, Russian-looking apartment blocks
                    - so familiar throughout the Soviet empire. On subsequent weekends, I went with
                    friends from the Embassy - or alone - to most of the major towns in Romania,:
                    Costanza, Kluj, Brashov, Timisoara, etc. I spoke with everyone and met many
                    wonderful people. I slept in small inns in the Transylvania mountains - and ate
                    in ancient beer halls. I met some many young people who would do anything to
                    leave the country - to begin a new life. So often I was asked if I wanted to
                    “invest in a financial venture”. I soon learned that “invest” meant no more than
                    one or two hundred dollars. Those sums, to these poor folks, re-presented a
                    fortune. Many of the people I met wrote me at the Embassy - and even wrote and
                    called me when I returned to France following my stay in Bucharest. I often
                    wonder how they fared; what they are doing today and if their lives are in any
                    way better.</p>
                <p>As an aside, should tell you that within three days after my original arrival in
                    Bucharest I was contacted by the office of the Romanian Orthodox Patriarch and
                    asked if I could come to visit him. I was amused to think that the Church was
                    still so connected with the government that they knew that I was in Bucharest!!
                    My three hour visit was most interesting: The Patriarch told me he knew of my
                    service in Rome and that he wanted to convey a message directly to Washington.
                    He thought I would be an excellent “vehicle” due to my understanding of “things
                    ecclesiastical” from my service at the Vatican. In effect - the Patriarch wanted
                    to explain why he had sent a cable of congratulations to Ceausescu after the
                    slaughter of so many innocent Romanians in the closing days of the struggle for
                    the dictator's overthrow. He said he was simply attempting to “protect his flock
                    - the same way that Jewish rabbis did in Germany during the period of National
                    Socialism”. The rest of our conversation was taken up with a denunciation of
                    Rome, John Paul II, the “Uniate Church” - and “the after-effects of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire with the announcement from the Vatican that a Romanian
                    Cardinal would be created for the Transylvania area of Romania (formerly
                    Hungary). This proved a most interesting interlude to my “adoption business” at
                    the Embassy in Bucharest. I saw the Patriarch and some of his bishops on a
                    couple of occasions - and then visited Archbishop John Bukovsky - the Papal
                    Nuncio in Bucharest - and an American from Chicago. I had worked with him in
                    Rome when he was assigned at the Secretariat of State.</p>
                <p>Following my second stay in Bucharest, I again became sick. After consulting with
                    doctors in France, I returned to the United States and, a few weeks later,
                    underwent a stomach operation in Boston. The operation was very successful - I'm
                    very happy to report! Following my recovery, the Department (CA/EX) asked me if
                    I would consider going up to Portsmouth, New Hampshire to undertake yet another
                    project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What in heaven's name is up in Portsmouth?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>MURPHY: In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, we were at that time establishing the
                    Department of State's National Passport Center and National Visa Center. The
                    location of these new offices was at the former Pease Air Force base. The
                    Department of State had taken over the former Air Force Base Post Exchange as
                    well as its Commissary and transformed these buildings into two consular
                    centers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a base being closed by the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: This base was closed. While I was up there, sort of overseeing the
                    reconstruction of the visa center, they gave me an office in the National
                    Passport Center - which was already in full operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was already established?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes - It was already established. This was something unique to me. I was
                    interested to see the operation because, for the first time in State's history,
                    they had hired a private company (Stanley Associates Inc. of Alexandria,
                    Virginia.) to produce U.S. passports. There were, under the Director - the late
                    Ronald Ayers - eight State Department employees working together with the
                    Stanley people. So in effect, you had private company and US government working
                    hand-in-glove producing about a third of the U.S. passports issued in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The others are produced where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: The others are produced directly by the Department of State and its
                    employees at U.S. Passport Agencies throughout the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Eventually will all passports be produced there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: It seems to me that's the wave of the future, Bill. Passports can be
                    produced quicker and faster by a private company in one huge center. It will be
                    difficult to close the Agencies - but I believe that in a few years there will
                    be simple “acceptance facilities” around the nation and the passports themselves
                    will be produced at two or three national centers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, with today's communications what they are, we can
                        transmit the information much faster.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. The Portsmouth National Immigrant Visa Center - to give you
                    a brief explanation - is sort of a huge file box. Example: an applicant for an
                    immigrant visa visits the Embassy in London and is told to return with certain
                    medical, police, educational documents needed for immigrant visa determination
                    and issuance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The famous processing system we've been using for
                        years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. So, instead of those documents being held for ten years at
                    Embassy London (until that person's number comes up and the visa can actually be
                    issued) - all those documents necessary for the issuance of the Immigrant Visa
                    are now sent to Portsmouth, New Hampshire for safe-keeping. At the time of
                    issuance, the information is sent by telegram from Portsmouth to the issuing
                    post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So basically what they do in Portsmouth is paper-oriented.
                        It has nothing at all to do with adjudication of the applicant's visa
                        eligibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Paperwork. No, no adjudication at all. The National Visa Center really is
                    a replacement for some of our very large local visa staffs overseas. The Center
                    also keeps track of the annual immigrant visa lottery - and this brings millions
                    of letters to Portsmouth each Spring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they have the language competence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: They do. They have competence in, I believe, 40 different languages. Many
                    of the Immigrant Visa Packets must be addressed in Chinese - or Russian or
                    whatever - and mailed directly to applicants in those countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So - up in New Hampshire they managed to find people to
                        work in all these languages?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Oh, yes, there was no difficulty. That is one benefit of recent
                    immigration, Bill!..</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>When the National Immigrant Visa Center finally opened - Stanley Associates asked
                    me if I wanted to work with them - - and I said “Why not!” It is far better than
                    sitting at home in Boston - - reading three daily newspapers! After all - I am
                    not yet 60 years old! I have a couple of good years left, I should think - -
                    although one never knows the future!! I like the work - and the people I work
                    with. In addition, it gives me the opportunity of visiting Washington - and the
                    State Department - frequently. I have also been twice to Europe and once to
                    Canada looking for new business for Stanley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're now living in Boston?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: Yes, I am Stanley Associate's sole employee in the Boston office. I
                    oversee their contracts with the Department of Transportation at the John A.
                    Volpe Transportation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I help my company with
                    certain DOD contracts at the Department of Transportation - as well as oversee
                    our State Department contracts. It keeps me busy - and also keeps me in contact
                    with friends in State. I also oversee our Machine Readable Visa contract (MRV)
                    on which we are a subcontractor to Orkand Corporation. In this capacity, I
                    frequently visit our missions overseas to check on installations: Calcutta, New
                    Delhi, Tunis, Rome, Moscow, Bern, New Delhi, Calcutta. I manage to keep busy,
                    Bill!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peter, I don't think you could possibly end a recitation
                        of a consular career without telling a “Visa Story”! We all have to have
                        visa story that we end whatever speech it is we make about consular work. I
                        bet you might have a good visa story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: How did you guess that I would just happen to have one, Bill!.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget my surprise when I accompanied Secretary of State George Shultz
                    to an audience with the Holy Father at the Vatican. This must have been in the
                    spring of 1985. The entire staff of the Shultz' Secretariat accompanied him - as
                    well as his wife. I recall that it was at Easter time - because the next day we
                    all went to the Papal Easter Mass in St. Peter's Square. After Mr. Shultz came
                    out of his private audience with the Pope - he came up to a small group of us
                    gathered there waiting for him. Shultz said, “The Pope's got some kind of a
                    problem with a visa that he wants us to look into. Take care of it for him,
                    would you?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His own?</hi>

                <p>MURPHY: No - it wasn't that bad! Shultz gave me a slip of paper with the name of
                    a Polish doctor - a psychiatrist I believe - with an address near Krakow,
                    Poland. I had heard the name before and told Shultz I would take care of it. The
                    woman in question had visited me at the Embassy the previous summer. I remember
                    that she was a most remarkable person - although don't ask me to tell you her
                    name! Those Polish names are not only unpronounceable - but also un-spellable!!
                    This woman was perhaps the Pope's closest lay friend from his university days.
                    They had been fellow students of drama when in school. Some say that the Pope
                    and she dated for about a year before he entered the seminary to begin his
                    clerical studies. Every summer the doctor, her husband (who is also a medical
                    doctor) and two of their grandchildren were visitors at Castel Gandolfo. They
                    usually stayed at the Papal summer retreat for two weeks - and were constantly
                    with the Pope. This woman was apparently the was the only person in the world,
                    according to a member of the papal Polish staff, who could actually contradict
                    him and tell him that he was wrong on something. As a matter of fact, one day
                    when she was in my office, and I asked her how her visit was going at Castel
                    Gandolfo, she told me that this summer she and the Pope were speaking only in
                    English at their meetings. (She herself spoke beautiful Oxford English.) “We
                    only speak English at meals. He has to get ready for his upcoming American trip
                    and his pronunciation is not very good.” To me, it was amazing to think that
                    this tiny woman sitting at my desk was sort of bossing the Pope around! This
                    woman's son-in-law, it turned out, was having difficulty with his J-1 exchange
                    visa. He was a lecturer at Fordham University in New York. For some reason, INS
                    did not want to extend his visa to permit him to finish the academic year before
                    returning to Poland. This young man was the subject of the Pope's query to
                    Secretary Shultz! As you can imagine, Bill, the visa problem was settled with
                    little fuss!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Among other things on his agenda, the Pope just mentioned
                        the visa.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>MURPHY: That's right. You must admit Bill - this is a very good Visa Story -
                    don't you think! The Secretary of State of the United States and the Pope!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you realize that there have been and will continue
                        to be movements to take the visa function out of the State Department. There
                        are some who want all immigration issues put together in one place - like
                        the White House or something like that. I would argue that the story you've
                        just told shows how you can't separate the visa function from international
                        politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>MURPHY: I agree, Bill. The visa function is inevitably intertwined with politics
                    and with our foreign policy. It is a part of our foreign policy. I feel strongly
                    that the function should remain in the State Department where foreign policy is
                    formulated. I do not believe that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has
                    ever fully appreciated the importance of immigration on an international scale.
                    And - sometimes, as we know full well, political considerations must overtake
                    any other considerations.</p>
                <p>I think this concludes my general comments, Bill. I hope that some of this
                    material will be useful - someday - to someone. Perhaps someday I shall add to
                    this report - and if I do, I promise to send a copy to Georgetown University. I
                    regret that it had taken me a very long time to revise this document. For that I
                    apologize. I must say, however, that I am grateful for the practice the exercise
                    has provided in sharpening my computer skills!!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I assure you this will be useful, Peter. All I can
                        say in conclusion on my side is thank you very much for fabulous,
                        interesting insights into your career. This is the conclusion of the Peter
                        K. Murphy interview. It is July 14, 1993. Thank you, Peter.</hi>

                <p>MURPHY: Glad to do it, Bill. I hope that this information will serve some useful
                    purpose some day. I should mention that I have written an addendum to this oral
                    history and deposited it with the Georgetown University School of Foreign
                    Service to be opened at a future date.</p>
