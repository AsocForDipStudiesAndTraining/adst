                <p>1972-2001</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you share with us something about your early life, and
                        I mean as early as you can remember. What type of South African society did
                        you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I, if you accept the Racial Classification Act, then I was classified as
                    so-called colored. I use the term “so-called colored” because as coloreds we
                    never accepted that classification but were forced by the laws of the country to
                    fill in the forms and list ourselves as coloreds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you filled in a form then it was of your own, this is
                        something you wrote. What were the consequences of not putting in the term
                        the government wanted you to put in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The consequences would be that you can be prosecuted because it is seen
                    as you do not accept the laws of the country, because every citizen of the
                    country had to be classified under the racial classification act. So you would
                    be classified as Negro, colored, African, Indian and White.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you think of yourself at the time? The government
                        considered you to be colored. What was your own identity ethnic or national
                        or community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: We did not accept the term “colored.” We saw ourselves as black. So I
                    see myself as black. But here were many coloreds who accepted the term colored,
                    and would not refer or call themselves black. Because the stain of the
                    government's policy of apartheid was divide and conquer, divide and rule. So
                    obviously they can split the people who were not white into different ethnic
                    classifications, the stronger the government's policy and the more successful
                    the policy of apartheid would be. So you would find that the government insisted
                    the terms they used were colored, African and Indian to classify the people who
                    were not white. And for us, as the thinking so called colored we did not accept
                    that. We saw ourselves the country as if they want to as being white or black,
                    but not colored or Indian.</p>
                <p>My first language was Afrikaans. But the educational system of the time it was
                    compulsory that you would do one language of the higher grade and your second
                    language on the lower grade. So I started doing Afrikaans on the higher grade
                    and English on the lower grade. But when I went to university, we did both
                    languages on the higher grade.</p>
                <p>A mystique was attached to the language. I never accepted although it was my
                    first language I was hesitant to use it. With a result of when I got married and
                    I had my own family, English became our first language, and Afrikaans became the
                    second language. That was prevalent through many of the South African ethnic
                    groups except for the Afrikaners who would strongly promote the Afrikaans
                    language. So you found that many coloreds like myself where our first language
                    was Afrikaans in our paternal homes, but in our own family we switched to
                    English.</p>
                <p>I was born in 1959 in Retreat like retreat, falling back. I was born in a shanty,
                    a sort of an iron shack. In Kirstenhof. Then in early 50's the Nationalist Party
                    came to power and they passed the colonial and heinous group Areas Act. Which
                    made it definitely a threat to the lives of anybody who was not white.</p>
                <p>I was living in a wooden iron shack which had no indoor plumbing, no electricity.
                    There was a tap about say two plus minus twenty yards plus minus six meters from
                    the back of our house. It was a communal tap.</p>
                <p>I come from a family of ten. My mother and father and then there were eight
                    children. We were six brothers and two sisters. My mother was a domestic worker,
                    and my father was a fisherman who fished on the boat that went out daily from
                    Kalk Bay Harbor, one of the southern suburbs of Cape Town. That is going in the
                    direction of Simonstown you get to Kalk Bay before you get to Simonstown.</p>
                <p>Let's say a wood and iron dwelling. We had I think there were two or three
                    bedrooms and a kitchen and an outside toilet. There wasn't actually a bathroom
                    you know. There was no kitchen sink. We would wash up in a basin. The dishes
                    would be washed in a basin, not a sink like we have in the modern
                    apartments.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds more like a commune than a family dwelling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Exactly. There were a lot of houses, each. The property was not ours. It
                    was owned by a white Afrikaner Kirsten. That is why they call the area
                    Kirstenhof. It was a community of about 80 to 100 families living in that
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You achieved a very high level of education. How did this
                        start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well it started before I became of school going age the Group Areas Act
                    was passed by the Nationalist government and we were forcibly removed. It was
                    declared a white area for the white ethnic group. So anybody who was not white
                    was not allowed to live in that area. The so-called colored family and our
                    neighbors we were all forcibly removed and settled in an area called Stuerhof,
                    sometimes called Deep River, which was one of the southern suburbs. We had to
                    move into a council dwelling. In other words houses built and owned by the city
                    of Cape Town, the Cape Town city council. So I was about four years old when we
                    moved there and started my schooling at the primary school run by the Anglican
                    Church, St. Luke's primary school.</p>
                <p>I should stress that the building is owned by the Anglican Church. Teachers are
                    appointed by the Western Cape Education Department. The education is the same as
                    I would have gotten in any other public school.</p>
                <p>There was the education department which was for the white ethnic group. There
                    was the department of Indian affairs. There was the department of Bantu affairs,
                    which was for Black African education. With each of these education departments,
                    the education offered was inferior. The top one would be the white. The one for
                    colored and Indians would be comparable. The worst one was the one for Bantu
                    education, for the black African. Bantu education brought about the school riots
                    in 1976 which brought about the change in the country. So the lesson that came
                    out of that, they wanted to make the main medium of instruction in Bantu
                    education Afrikaans. The Black Africans as I prefer to call them detested that
                    language. The lesson that I learned out of that is, don't mess with a person's
                    language. It is very important. It was so important that it brought about the
                    change in this country.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Because of the Group Areas Act the whole country is divided, so you would find
                    coloreds, an area would be for people of the colored ethnic group only. Another
                    area would be for the Indian ethnic group. Another area would be for Black
                    Africans only Another area would be for whites only. So the whole country was
                    divided into group areas. So you would find that the best areas obviously would
                    be given to the white ethnic group There they wouldn't make distinction between
                    the Afrikaans speaking white and the English speaking white. So then of course
                    by virtue of the fact that if I live now in say that particular area in
                    Stuerhof, it was a very large pocket where this municipal housing scheme was
                    there would only be coloreds. But then normally it was a railway track or a
                    major road that would be the boundary. Then on the other side of the tracks
                    would be white. So we were surrounded by whites but we never socialized with
                    them. And to a certain extent the legislation prevented socialization across
                    color lines. It was actually laws that would prosecute you. Like for instance
                    you couldn't dance with a white. Coloreds and Africans and Indians can dance
                    together but not the white. They couldn't because of the immorality act, I could
                    not have a relationship with a white woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the Immorality Act. Was that from the same
                        period 40's-50's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The Immorality Act was also in the 40's and 60's which the state
                    actually had white inspectors who would monitor people who were having
                    relationships across the color line. These people would normally when things
                    really got serious would go and resettle in countries like Swaziland, Botswana.
                    They were like principalities or whatever you want to call it, within South
                    Africa, but they had individual sovereign rights. So if these inspectors if they
                    know you are having a relationship with a white woman as a black Indian or
                    colored, they would hide in the bedroom, you know in the cupboard, and when
                    things really got serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The inspector would be in the room?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, because he knows now that you are having a relationship with a
                    person other , you know with a white person. Then they would arrest the couple
                    and they would be charged under the Immorality Act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing. It sounds like a Peter Sellers movie. So there is
                        this inspector under the bed or in the closet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: In the closet, under the bed but mostly in the closet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People know this. Didn't they check under the bed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: They didn't suspect, you know. They didn't know that the authorities
                    knew about them. Or sometimes you would have informers who would inform the
                    appropriate authorities that X and Y is having a racial relationship across
                    color lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the penalty once detained or once identified, you say
                        that one of the people could be resettled to a distant country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, what would happen is you could be charged under the Morality Act. In
                    most cases there would be a fine. In other cases the one person would be
                    prosecuted and sentenced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sentenced to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Maybe two months, three months. It has happened.</p>
                <p>Travel was possible, but there was control over the passport being issued. A
                    passport at that time was not a right; it was a privilege.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A passport permitting exit from the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah traveling out of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Similar to the Soviet travel passport.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I would say so because you see like the first passport I got was to
                    travel to the United States. I was going to the United States, so when I applied
                    for the passport it said I could only travel to the United States and to
                    Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. I didn't get all countries like you
                    get today. So they controlled where you could, and you would never get a
                    passport to go to any of the African countries. You would get a passport to go
                    to the communist countries like Cuba you know, Soviet Union etc. So it was
                    controlled, and it was not a right, it was a privilege. Traveling was limited
                    and it was a privilege.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the U.S. was permitted.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: In '76 I went to the United States working for the U.S. government. It
                    was my first time on an airplane. It was my first time outside the country. So
                    people didn't travel a lot, and it wasn't easy to travel for various
                    reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I just want to tell you a little more about he group areas act. The Group Areas
                    Act was an act that was passed to create an infrastructure conducive to the
                    nationalist government's apartheid policy. You know the strength of their policy
                    was on divide and rule. Keep the ethnic groups separate, so everything, the
                    Group Areas Act made sure that in every sphere of South African life and society
                    we were separate. It called for separate schools. It called for separate
                    transport systems. Like we couldn't travel as a white and a black, we couldn't
                    travel on a bus together, on a train taxi. Everything was separated under the
                    group. Sports. Special sports for African, colored, Indian. You couldn't find a
                    colored, a time like now which would have mixed races in the team. Everything
                    was separate. Schooling was separate, seven separate education departments. Even
                    our universities, let me tell you what happened with the universities under the
                    Group Areas Act. The universities were like UCT [University of Cape Town] and
                    Wits [University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg], and the other major
                    universities. They allowed people of different ethnic groups to study at the
                    university, and that is after standard 10 or grade 12, right, when you would
                    start your first year at the university. But when the university extension act
                    was passed, this called for separate universities for the separate ethnic
                    groups. So what happened, UCT was closed to people other than white. Those of us
                    like myself who were studying at UCT under the system...</p>
                <p>The University exchange Act was passed. So they told us, “Listen. When you are
                    finished with your degree you cannot just come back. It is not automatic. You
                    have got to go through the permit system.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then the University Extension Act was passed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Then Wits became a university for whites in the Eastern Cape. But the
                    language thing then suffers because predominately English speaking whites the
                    university catered for them, Rhodes University. So they then established a
                    university for the Afrikaans speaking group, and that was the University of Port
                    Elizabeth in the eastern cape. But they catered for about plus or minus 6000
                    learners, students to attend that university for the Afrikaner group. They only
                    managed to muster plus or minus 2000 at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the professors all white?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: I would say at that time plus-minus 80% of the professors were white.
                    Afrikaner the highest quality. Then the bad thing about this was then the kids,
                    the students then decided to chose disciplines that is not offered at their
                    ethnic university in order to get a better education. So the courses that they
                    offered turned to be drama. Turned out to be architecture, medicine, you know,
                    sort of curses that is not offered at the ethnic university. But the bad thing
                    about that was they would go and they would get into these faculties and
                    discover that this is not what I wanted to do. So the drop out rate was
                    exacerbated tremendously. Also if you look at courses like architecture or
                    medicine, they are seven year courses. It was too long and many of these kids
                    because the educational system was also inferior. Like you take a guy coming
                    from say a rural black high school, coming to a school like UCT, of course there
                    were no bridging programs at that time because of the inferiority of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were set up for failure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Failure, yeah, and the dropout rate was tremendously high. I was at the
                    University of Cape Town. Now I was in my final year so I graduated. I was
                    allowed to graduate, but I was not allowed to re-register because I wanted to
                    communications and sociology were my two majors. That was offered at The
                    University of the Western Cape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The “Bush” college.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The bush college. So I wouldn't go there. I didn't want to do it at that
                    time. Now of course the bush college is internationally recognized. The guys
                    turned the tables on the government with UWC, but at that time it was a bush
                    college and I wasn't going to go for an inferior education. So what I did then ,
                    I did my second degree in communications. That is when I joined USIS. I did my
                    second degree with a major in communications and diplomacy. I did that,
                    communication and sociology were my two majors. So I did that through UNISA, the
                    University of South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated from UCT. What was the name of the
                        diploma, what we would call a bachelors degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, it was given as a lower diploma in library science, but when I did
                    my second degree with UNISA, you know the degree in communication and sociology,
                    they upgraded that to a degree in library science.</p>
                <p>At that time under the Group Areas Act, as I said, education, libraries, there
                    were libraries for whites only; there were libraries for coloreds and Indian and
                    there were libraries for black Africana.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell us about the library where you worked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I worked for different libraries under the municipality of Cape Town in
                    colored areas. So the clientele were all colored. Whites weren't allowed to come
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you worked in more than one library.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I became a senior librarian and ended up training the young librarians
                    going into my place. But I had a library, well I was assigned as librarian in
                    charge at different libraries. All of the main colored libraries I served as
                    librarian there because they would move you around. They don't leave you all the
                    time, 14 years, at one. But I would go around, and at my library where I was the
                    librarian in charge there I would train colored librarians and African
                    librarians going to the colored and African libraries. The other thing that I
                    should mention here that is significant is that the different libraries were for
                    the different ethnic groups, white, they would have different people.</p>
                <p>We were assigned to a particular library. Then say after three or four years you
                    would go to another library. But throughout the time that I was working there, I
                    would be sort of seen as a senior librarian training young librarians coming in.
                    But what I should mention is, it came to me and now it has disappeared again.
                    Now while I worked for the city libraries I didn't agree with all their policies
                    you know. The one thing I thought was that the library shouldn't just be a place
                    where people come to borrow books and leave. I thought that it would be a
                    cultural center where I could invite guest speakers to come and do talks. Then
                    that was also the time when there was the U.S. moon exploration programs. Then I
                    got Rupert Early who was the specialist monitoring astronaut activities from the
                    U.S. side, and I invited Rupert Early to come and do a talk, and I started a
                    borrowers association, library borrowers association.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rupert Early was someone in the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, he was a South African who monitored and was involved with the
                    astronaut program. Then I did this and I also one of the other extra little
                    projects I organized was I discovered there were a lot of artists, painters
                    living as part of my clientele I was serving. Then I arranged a big art
                    exhibition for members of my clientele who were involved in art. Some of these
                    were international artists like Peter Clark, Kenneth Baker. Then the city
                    librarian did not agree with this. I founded them on my own. But then I used
                    Albert Green who was the art critic at the Argus as the critic.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>The Argus, the evening English language newspaper. I then used Albert Green as
                    the person to critique the art exhibition. There was a lot of coverage in the
                    local newspapers, in the local radio, and then the city librarian wanted to be
                    part of the act now. I said, no I am not going to lie to you because when I came
                    to you for money I couldn't have any money. But then Bob Gosende saw this in the
                    paper, and he was the big shot at the USIS Cape Town. He called me in and said,
                    “Frank, I have a librarian here but she is not doing what I want her to do. You
                    are the type of guy I want to come and run my library.” That is how I joined the
                    USIS in 1972. Bob Gosende was my director. I served about three years as
                    librarian and then Bob says, “No, I want you to be the public affairs assistant.
                    “</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This all happened very quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. He said, “No I want you and you have the potential.” So Bob is the
                    guy who got me into USIS in that way. When I started, Bob put me in as person in
                    charge of all programming, exchanges and programming and his assistant you know.
                    Then I said to Bob, I don't have the qualifications in diplomacy or whatever.
                    Can I register with UNISA and do a degree in communications and sociology but
                    specializing in diplomacy and public relations. So Bob then spoke to USIS in
                    Pretoria and USIS paid for my studies to qualify with UNISA in communications
                    with a specialization in diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UNISA was distance learning so you were working full
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I was working fulltime. So if you joined UNISA you get study guides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were a full time employee and you were also doing
                        an advanced degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I was doing my second degree with UNISA. USIS paid for my studies and my
                    books, and I could get a lot of the books in the USIS library so I did my
                    studies. Anybody who wanted to study to upgrade themselves was allowed to do
                    so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q:A classification team came from Washington...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: From Washington. It was a classification team looking at upgrading
                    salaries. Then we also got a car allowance which was unique. But we negotiated
                    this with the team. And we also got a food allowance because they said there
                    were too few in Cape Town to give a cafeteria. So I said to them well if there
                    is too few, we can do something else.” The said, “Well what can we do?” I said,
                    “Look why don't you go to Cal Tech, the American multinational who have
                    cafeterias and see how they subsidize them.” They said, “What do you mean?” I
                    said, “Look, go to Cal Tech or to 3-M one of the companies, and say to them how
                    do you subsidize.” So at that time the multi national corporations their
                    cafeterias would serve plates of curry and rice for two rand. They only paid two
                    rand, right. So it was subsidized. So but how do we do that? I said, “Well you
                    go to 3-M or to Cal Tech and ask them to give you a plate of food. Then you go
                    to a take away and ask them how much do they sell that plate of food for. So
                    they took that and the take away guy said we sell it for 12 rand. So I said to
                    them, “OK, seeing those guys only paid two rand, you give us ten rand food
                    subsidy, and then we pay the two rand so we can buy. The inspectors laughed and
                    said, “No that is good Frank, we can give you a food allowance.” So we
                    successfully negotiated an education allowance, a 60% housing subsidy repayment
                    bond and the food subsidy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think this would be possible today in these days of
                        cost cutting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well I think you can check this out with the embassy but I think these
                    subsidies are still in operation. But you see then the Sullivan principles came
                    out in the U.S. and the embassy their policy was they should upgrade the living
                    standards and life style of their employees. So this put it in well. They looked
                    good with the Sullivan principles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's explain to the person reading here about the
                        Sullivan Principles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, the Sullivan Principles, Leon Sullivan was a minister of religion
                    in the U.S. He was at that time the Ford Motor Company and multi nationals were
                    pressurized to do something for the black employees in Sough Africa They came
                    out with the principles in which way the living standards must be upgraded. Leon
                    Sullivan was the mover behind that. He, then insisted that these principles must
                    be at the UN. These became official principles that the U.S. government also
                    enforced in the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was some controversy about the Sullivan principles.
                        Some people said if you incrementally improve the system it would be
                        impossible to end the system. So there was some controversy about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: The thing is that is why as FSNs we insisted this is going to help, it
                    should be for all who are underprivileged, whether they were a white group we
                    did not do it for blacks only. So it was possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not strictly tied to the Sullivan principle,
                        but the Sullivan principles were the rationale that the U.S. government used
                        to make this possible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The Sullivan principles did that they should enhance the quality of life
                    of the employees. This enabled us to buy houses once the Group Areas Act was
                    abolished in the former white areas. So it vastly improved the standard of
                    housing, and resultantly the standard of living But as I say it wasn't exclusive
                    to blacks it was to all employees who qualified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I sense we are in the 70's here. A gradual change
                        because the U.S. government, as an employee of the U.S. government you were
                        able to effect a type of change that was not possible outside of the U.S.
                        embassy community I think, and yet you were permitted to move into an area.
                        It sounds as if the changes that happened in Sough Africa were gradual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: It was gradual. And one thing you must take cognizance of the U.S.
                    government conditions of employment in South Africa. Every year a team would
                    come out from Washington to conduct wage surveys. It was not just wages, but
                    more importantly conditions of service. So they would go and select about ten or
                    twenty U.S. corporates in South Africa and do a survey of conditions of
                    employment. That is why they approved the housing subsidy because most U.S.
                    companies were paying housing subsidies to the employees. They paid
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the embassy matched the private sector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right, and we suggested this to the classification team that came. They
                    with the wage surveys said we must give this to our employees because it is
                    being offered by the American companies in South Africa.</p>
                <p>The wage survey team, this was also supported by the American ambassador in South
                    Africa who was actually behind us seeing this wage classification team and first
                    speaking to them. Now what is interesting about this, the U.S. government or the
                    people assigned by the U.S. government to consider the subsidies we are asking
                    declined. They rejected on the very grounds you are mentioning. How can we give
                    this to South Africa when we are not going to give this to any other FSNs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Defined by the bureaucracy in Washington you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: The Bureaucracy in Washington and the reasoning was exactly what you
                    brought up now. Can we give it to South Africans now and make them unique
                    getting this where nowhere else in the word is this offered. So then the
                    ambassador called me and said, “Frank, are you accepting this?” He called me and
                    So I said, “No I am not accepting this.” “Well you have got to substantiate.” I
                    said, “I can't substantiate. Mr. Ambassador, you should go back to Washington
                    and tell them the reason I feel this should be given to South Africans if it is
                    unique because my argument is nowhere else in the world is pigmentation a
                    criteria for granting a bond, subsidy to South Africa. That makes us unique. But
                    it is a violation of our rights.” The Ambassador went in and he came back and
                    said, “Fine, they will approve.” You see what I am saying is I couldn't blame
                    the U.S. because any rational independent thinking person would come up as you
                    did with the point you raised. Then when I countered the Ambassador said,
                    “Frank, I like that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's dwell a moment on Bart Rousseve who was a great
                        mentor. Bart Rousseve, an African American from New Orleans who worked in
                        New York and in Washington with various organizations</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Operation Crossroads Africa was the main one. He and Jerry Vogel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, and later I saw Jerry a couple of months ago. And
                        later the International Institute of Education, the African American
                        Institute. He came to South Africa, I believe that the South African
                        government gave him a visa each time he came. He was an honorary white
                        because I think Black citizens from other countries had restrictions or were
                        not welcome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: These participants in Operation Crossroads Africa they were young
                    professionals. They were just starting on their careers. They were very
                    competent people, but they were maybe community workers. They were maybe
                    government officials. But as a result of the Operation Crossroads experience,
                    they developed international contacts, especially contacts with their
                    counterparts in Africa which was nonexistent. Because that operation crossroads
                    Africa program was unique in the sense that it got groups of young African
                    professionals from all countries in Africa together so they had both the U.S.
                    and the African experience, with made it a very unique program. Today, a couple
                    of weeks back I spoke to a guy who says he still has contacts that he got out of
                    that program with guys that he met on the ___. This guy in Ghana, he is now the
                    surrogate father of this guy's children. And the guys come to you and say Frank
                    thanks for printing that. You know South Africa was isolated. We had no entr�e
                    to Africa. They had to go six or ten thousand miles to meet their African
                    counterparts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you explain Ron Hendrickse.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Ron Hendrickse was a colleague of mine working on exchanges. He is still
                    with USIS at the moment. Now he was the one running exchanges at the time, took
                    over from me the Operation Crossroads Africa program, and Bart raised the belief
                    that you mentioned that most of the participants on the Operation Crossroads
                    Africa were recommended or selected by their respective governments. These
                    participants when they met with the South Africans just assumed that their South
                    African participants were also selected and recommended by their government,
                    right. So then I said to Bart we must talk. We explained to him that in South
                    Africa the South African government is in no way involved in the selection
                    program. The U.S. the our U.S. officers in South Africa used to take a long
                    night off the program and FSNs and an American officer would make up a panel
                    which would selected the respective South Africans to go. So there was no
                    government involvement. So we said to Bart it is important that at the
                    orientation in the U.S. that you make this point with the participants,
                    Operation Crossroads Africa participants from other countries that although they
                    were recommended and selected by their government, because of the apartheid
                    programs and because of the status of the South African government they were not
                    involved in the operations. Bart said that and it helped out tremendously.</p>
                <p>Let me mention something else that will shock you. I with debriefing, we would
                    always send him a report how these South Africans found it. One guy from Port
                    Elizabeth was a participant. He mentioned something very significant. He said
                    they had a discussion on a ferry going around the Statue of Liberty or somewhere
                    in New York where the Operation Crossroads Africa. He was, when he came back he
                    was as always the case many of the South African security police divisions were
                    detained our grantees when they returned and interrogated them. What this guy
                    said to me, he said, “Frank if I didn't hear this myself, and I had to pinch
                    myself to see if I was not dreaming. One of the security police officials could
                    recite virtually verbatim a discussion that this guy Ernie had with other
                    participants on the ferry around.” So What you guys didn't know, I didn't
                    mention this to our BPAO [Branch Public Affairs Officer] at the time that they
                    had infiltrated. They were so scared of us taking these young blacks, and they
                    couldn't refuse them passports or traveling facilities, so they put the
                    informers on the a police informer on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is a mind boggling thing. Informers would be
                        ethnically the same, that is to say majority population, African or colored
                        who were working for the police. Now you say that the South African
                        government had nothing to do with the selection. Were they able to bribe
                        participants after the selection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I later found out there were informers, blacks you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So these would be people with a certain presence but
                        clandestinely working with the South African police and then went to inform
                        on the others. Now you said the South African government could not refuse to
                        give passports. I thought they could refuse.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Let me explain that and elaborate on that. You see if you as a black
                    apply for a passport, as I say it is a privilege, not a right. Now because he
                    gets a letter from the U.S. ambassador inviting now this is the OCA participant,
                    inviting him or her to go on this program to the United States, it is more
                    difficult for them to refuse that passport application.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? Are they afraid of the American embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well yeah. It is because the U.S. government is inviting him it is going
                    to put them in a bad light. They don't want to give this person the right to go
                    on the program. But then they reconsider when you approach them and say, now
                    they don't say no. they just delay it. Now it is maybe two or three weeks before
                    departure. Like we nominated a guy who was going into community policing to go
                    on Operation Crossroads Africa to interact with his peer group in the U.S. they
                    kept on and in the end it was two weeks before departure. So I had to call the
                    guy who happened to be a so-called colored guy who was in this position who had
                    to approve the leave for this person and permission to go. He said he made all
                    kinds of excuses. I must now rattle your cage. So I said to him, “Look, I cannot
                    tell you how to do your job. As the senior brigadier in the police it is your
                    right to grant him leave or not. But all I want to tell you the U.S. government
                    has obligated ten thousand dollars for this program and you know fiscal policies
                    within government, if that money is not utilized,” I lied to him and said, “they
                    want to get it from somebody because they are going to lose that money. I don't
                    know if they are going to get you as the person who refused the leave to get the
                    money back. “ He said, “OK, let me think about it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you bluffed...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah I bluffed. I said I wasn't sure. I can't say they are going to but
                    what if they now hold you liable because you refused this guy going and notice
                    is too short to find another person. So I am just saying to you that if that
                    happens then they are going to see you as the person liable for this person not
                    going. So he called me back that afternoon and he said, “Look I have told Ike to
                    pack his bags and he is going.” So this is how you play and you have to
                    challenge but always because it is the U.S. government inviting the person they
                    would give the passport to that person to travel whereas the average person just
                    going on his own, and they would use delaying tactics and then at the last
                    minute they would.</p>
                <p>This was in the late 80's. Now the thing is they wanted to the idea of not
                    getting the passport is isolated, especially black South Africans from
                    interacting with their peers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is what the South African...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: That is what they wanted. The other thing they came up with another
                    ploy. When they saw now that they had to give passports, South African Passports
                    to these guys to refuse the passports so they cannot travel. So what they did
                    when they created the homeland policy, you know the homeland policy was although
                    you lived in Guguletu, Khayelitsha or in the Cape Town urban area, if you were
                    born in a homeland you would not be a South African citizen. You would get a
                    transcribed passport.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We should say these passports were recognized nowhere in
                        the world except in South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right. So now say you were a student and they can trace you back to the
                    Ciskei. You would get a Ciskei passport. You have got a Fulbright grant to go
                    and do a masters or a Ph.D. The U.S. does not recognize a Ciskei passport so
                    they say sorry you can't get the grant. So what I was one of the people in a
                    meeting with the embassy officials where we came up with this and I suggested
                    and simultaneously an American officer also suggested it. I said, “Why don't we
                    do this, we accept that passport, right, but we do not put a visa in the
                    passport. We let the person who is a Ciskei citizen submit two photographs,
                    three photographs. Then the one photograph we put on a piece of paper. We stamp
                    the visa on a piece of paper and then we attach it to the passport. That person
                    then travels to the U.S. on a Ciskei passport. When he enters the entry is
                    stamped on the page that is attached to the passport with his photograph. When
                    he leaves they rip it out. So he can't prove that the U.S. accepted his
                    passport. So that worked. So we then took the guys on the homeland
                    passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I cannot imagine the Department of Homeland Security
                        accepting such a thing now. In those days was there a closer connection
                        between the consular services? How did you persuade the U.S. government in
                        the port of Kennedy Airport in New York City to accept a Ciskei
                        passport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: We had a meeting in Cape Town. It was the political officer; A decision
                    came out of that meeting. I was one of the people who suggested that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The decision was made in Cape Town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: In Cape Town and then sent to Washington. In order to get the officials
                    at Kennedy or Reagan to accept this it had to go through Washington or through
                    the agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, they
                        cooperated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: They cooperated because we then accepted as I say they had to give an
                    extra photograph, and this was put on a separate sheet of paper that was
                    attached to the passport. So the passport had no visa stamp in it. The passport
                    had no entry or exit stamp in it.</p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I see some, and I remember also the American diplomats at one time had
                    to travel with two passports if they traveled to Africa especially if they had a
                    South African connection. So there were flexibility and I know we had that
                    meeting and it was conveyed to Washington to the appropriate people in
                    Washington, and the immigration people accepted that. Because you see they said
                    it was unfair to deprive the black South African or the black African in South
                    Africa of studying or visiting the U.S. because of the South African
                    government's policy. That homeland policy was obviously designed to prevent
                    blacks from traveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is astonishing because the U.S. government which
                        was receiving a lot of criticism for being easy on the apartheid system, in
                        fact at least the INS and the embassy consulate were in fact working
                        perfectly harmoniously with those who had ideas on how to get around the
                        rules.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Definitely that was the case because in the initial reaction of the
                    consulate and immigration was they guy has a Ciskei passport he can't go. We do
                    not recognize that. But at this meeting we discussed this and said it is unfair.
                    We are depriving that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand the argument in South Africa. What is amazing
                        to me is that it was accepted by the authorities in Washington. How long did
                        it take to persuade them, weeks, months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Months. It wasn't very long. But you must admit that it wouldn't have
                    worked if Washington hadn't approved it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who convinced Washington, was it the ambassador do you
                        think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Could be. The Ambassador as head of the mission he had to be involved in
                    this, and maybe with the Secretary of State for African Affairs was Chester
                    Crocker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and Hank Cohen. Again just for the record Chester
                        Crocker the author of Constructive Engagement, was under enormous criticism
                        from the left wing in the United States as being a sellout, by being too
                        friendly. And so many paradoxes in the American intelligentsia, Chet Crocker
                        at the time was a very controversial, Frank, as a South African, and from
                        your perspective, it seems that some measures were taken which in fact were
                        pretty helpful to the social advancement...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, Americans saw it in South Africa we had tremendous problems with
                    Constructive Engagement. You had South African leadership refusing to come to
                    some of our programs, refusing to participate on our programs. What I found was
                    that I understand why they opted for constructive engagement. They started from
                    the premise at first to challenge the South Africans, of course not wanting to
                    change, isolating them, embargoes whatever. Then they saw look, why not try and
                    show them we are their friend and want to try to help them So they came with
                    constructive engagement.</p>
                <p>Yeah, and I remember Sandy Ungar [former NPR correspondent] and guys writing, I
                    know Sandy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the president of Goucher College.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I know. I actually saw, did he seem ever since, I think I did, yes. But
                    the thing is that they tried but constructive engagement was my worst time as a
                    black South African working for the embassy. You can imagine the flak I got from
                    my contacts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me more. You are talking about the politically aware,
                        the intelligentsia considering you to be too friendly with an evil
                        process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Look, I always to survive and for my credibility to transcend
                    political ideologies, I never during my time with USIS publicly declared my
                    political ideologies. I was a professional. I took the job and I knew I couldn't
                    only work with guys who have the same political ideologies I had. I had to work
                    with guys who support the apartheid structure, the CP, the freedom front. As a
                    professional I had to give them the same service as I give the guy from the PAC.
                    So I took a leave . I did the Book of Tutu. Tutu is never publicly declared his
                    political ideology.</p>
                <p>Boesak made a mistake. He publicly declared his political ideology. You know with
                    Cope he is coming back into the political arena now. He has been nominated now
                    if Cape wins the Western Cape he will be the premier. So I found that even like
                    my friends they used to joke about it. They would say how is the American spy
                    coming. But it was said in jest the Zalpo, the PAC guys, but they all respected
                    me because they didn't know where my political leanings were.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>So I find for me the worst time as a South African and to convince my contacts
                    and to retain my credibility was the constructive engagement. The other thing
                    about constructive engagement even the guys like at that time the PFP, the
                    Progressive Federal party of what is now the DA, Democratic Alliance. This is
                    Colin Eglin. They refused to even come to the Fourth of July one year because of
                    this closeness, and they actually asked Piet Koornhof a minister at that time of
                    home affairs to be the guest speaker at the Fourth of July, and that was the
                    year that Pete Koornhof gave the order for the authorities to demolish the
                    temporary housing in winter, the temporary housing of squatters in crossroads to
                    go in and break down the shelters. And at night, the people during the day would
                    break down the shelters. At night they bury it, and at night they put up the
                    shacks as shelters again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sorry, the name of this man?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Dr. Pieter Koornhof. Now he was the minister of home affairs at the
                    time. No, minister of community development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And his version of development was to demolish the
                        housing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and they The PFP guys, this is the Progressive Freedom Party,
                    which was the chief opposition. They said is this the U.S. government's reward
                    to Pieter Koornhof to address the Fourth of July function by virtue of the fact
                    that he demolished the shacks. So you see that is what we had to live with. It
                    was a bad time, and we as FSNs were also tarnished with the same brush. A lot of
                    guys refused U.S. government grants on the grounds of that if you are close with
                    the South African government. It means that you are supporting apartheid, you
                    know all kinds of interpretations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an enormously important principle . If you are
                        trying to change a system that has it wrong, you can confront; you can
                        engage constructively, You can ignore; you can turn to violence as some
                        people did. What was your moral compass at that time. Not to be flattering,
                        I have no need to be flattering, but how were you so smart as to know that
                        not revealing a personal ideology enhanced your personal credibility. How
                        did you understand that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Look, I just took a leaf out of Desmond Tutu's book. I saw what he was
                    doing and what was happening to Boesak. I realized if I do not declare my
                    political ideology, they wouldn't know which way my leanings are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do this in public?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Look, it would be mostly on one on one issues, and it would be in a room
                    in this guy's office or it would be in a room say at USIS where you get the two
                    of them to meet over coffee and chat. So I wouldn't say it was in public per
                    se.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you say you took this from Tutu. I am sure you
                        discussed this with your American colleagues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They never asked me and I never discussed it with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They never asked and you never discussed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They unless they knew what my leanings were, but we never discussed
                    this. This is a viable strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an enormous guiding principle in doing the work
                        that you do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They never asked me, and that was a survival strategy with me. Could you
                    imagine if I even shouted my political activities you know. I remember we had an
                    incident where the police arrested seven, no eight high school students. They
                    were going to make an example of them because these kids were at a political
                    rally and the security police chased them and they caught these eight kids. They
                    charged them with terrorist activities for going to this rally. The one kid
                    before he was sentenced skipped the country, but the other seven, and my niece
                    happened to be one of them. That is why I got involved. So then these were 17-18
                    year olds. They had the trial and some of them were sentenced to five years,
                    some of them were sentenced to three years and some of them were sentenced to
                    one year in prison, political prisoners.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the nature of the gathering?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: It was a political rally where you know, say undercover ANC leadership
                    and black politicians were speaking. In any case....</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were accused of terrorism. For attending a
                        political discussion.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. So they chased and they just randomly caught these eight kids. So
                    these kids were going to prison, and the sentencing was political, but they
                    weren't treated as political criminals. They were going to be thrown in with
                    thieves, murderers etc. You know what would happen to kids that age in prison.
                    So I then went clandestinely, I didn't even tell the Americans, and that time
                    these guys didn't know about press conferences. But my American experience made
                    me unique. Even the ANC domestic wing contacted me to find out how do you do
                    press conferences. In any case, I did a press conference, and I said to the
                    guys, we must have a press conference to focus the plight, international
                    attention to the plight of these kids. Here are 17-18 year olds who are going to
                    prison. They are going to be thrown in with common prisoners. What is going to
                    happen to these kids. I went to a meeting of the Weinberg crisis committee, and
                    couldn't convince everybody that we should have this press conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they afraid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, they were two groups. There were guys who went out that were ANC and
                    then guys who were the unity movement. Only the new Unity Movement is an old
                    political movement, but at that time they were swimming against the mainstream,
                    but the guys were very eloquent and were more vocal than the other guys. So I
                    said to the guy who was chairman at the time I said, “Listen, these guys
                    although they are the most vocal, they are in the minority. So let's pass two
                    motions and vote on it. If we vote, the majority is going to vote in favor of
                    the press conference.” He said, “Frank that is excellent.” This guy is now the
                    chief legal advisor to the South African government.. So we then I got another
                    guy to pass the first motion that we must have the press conference. Another guy
                    passed the second motion that we shouldn't have it. So then when we voted pick
                    the one you favor. They were more vocal, but they were in the minority. So we
                    had the press conference. I tell you then I did a press release. I sent it
                    through SAPA. The guy at SAPA said to me , no we can get onto the wires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: South African Press Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: South African Press Agency, yes. They sent it to all the media outlets,
                    and then I could contact all these foreign media correspondents because
                    parliament is in Cape Town. And I worked with them. So we had ABC; we had
                    Columbia; we had the Germans; we had the Swiss. The television cameras were all
                    there. You know I heard afterwards, this was in the annex of St. George's
                    Cathedral. Because you know with the media you have to go where they are, to be
                    convenient for them. We had it over lunch time. The place was surrounded by
                    security police. But I wasn't at the table. I briefed the guy who was chairing
                    how to handle a press conference.</p>
                <p>Then we had every paper, international, they all covered this. Here was kid 17-18
                    who is now going to be made an example for other students. We had the thing, man
                    it was such a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is very delicate. You were working for the U.S.
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I put my neck out there. You are the first one to tell this. But I mean
                    I don't care. I am out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it is very admirable what you did. Again the risks
                        that you took. First of all the security people were there and bad things
                        could have happened. Second the Americans, what you did might have fit into
                        the American strategy or not. So you were dealing at the time as an
                        individual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, they wouldn't have supported me on this one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They wouldn't have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Because you see the reason I did it then I knew the risk involved.
                    It was my sister's daughter who was being used by the security police to get a
                    message across, and it was a risk and I knew. Because the ambassador at the time
                    you know they arrested my son to get to, to scare me. At that time it was job
                    related. These things were job related, and I went to the ambassador and I told
                    him they interrogated my son and I then with this guy was no legal advisor for
                    the government. He was my attorney. We turned the case around and my son was
                    acquitted. I will tell you later how that happened. So I thought that we must,
                    Look OK so I went to the ambassador to tell him what happened with my son. They
                    arrested my son to scare me and all that. So the Ambassador said to me “Frank,
                    if anything is officially job related, and you have any problems with the
                    security police, you come and see me.” The ambassador and said that if it is an
                    assignment they gave me and because of that I get into disfavor with the
                    security police then they will bat for me as far as they can go. I don't know
                    what he meant by that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same thing you meant if you go and rob a bank you will
                        not...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Exactly. Say he gives me an assignment and I carry out the assignment
                    which is an official duties, then he says they will, and he even said if it
                    means getting you and the family if it is so bad they must get me out of the
                    country, they will still try and support. But he didn't say how far they would
                    go but he said he was doing, because look. I was discussed in parliament at one
                    time about activities in the Eastern</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>cape. This was a hotbed for South African activities. He said to me, “Now Look,
                    you do...” And I told him the security police guys from the dockyard where my
                    brother worked for the South African navy. This guy called me and he asked me
                    and he said he was with the navy security, if he can come and speak to me
                    because my brother and myself would meet at social functions and my brother in
                    the navy might tell me secrets. I said, “Listen, the last thing we talk about is
                    the shop or job. We talk about family issues.” As a family we get together. I
                    said, “Are you sure you are not the security police.” He said, “No, don't think
                    that. We are not. But we would like to meet with you.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well let me discuss this with the ambassador. I am not involved in any
                    subversive activities. I am working for the embassy as you know, but I would
                    like my ambassador to be there at this meeting.” He said, “No I want to see you
                    at your home.” I said, 'No, you are not coming to my home. You come to the
                    embassy and if it is legit that you are concerned about naval security issues
                    you come and talk to me in front of the ambassador and he will concur and vouch
                    for what I am telling you.” I never heard from them again. So I knew they were
                    concerned and wanted to know what I am involved in, so that is why I went to the
                    ambassador and told him, and he said to me now at the point we raised is what I
                    did that time I stuck my neck out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you had a personal connection with your niece.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, if anything had to happen, and I understand that then, that it
                    would have been my neck. They would have said look, because the embassy in no
                    uncertain terms told us don't get involved in that type of thing. Well this is
                    now BPAO, who was a very apolitical guy, but that is what he told me when there
                    were marchers and things like that. He said, “If you guys go to these things,”
                    and I was beaten up at two marches, but he said, “You are an your own. You can
                    get into trouble.” I believe that was his policy or it was embassy policy, but I
                    just assumed that it wouldn't be good for me as an employee of the embassy to
                    get involved. And many of us did that. We were involved, but very subtly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you were smart enough to get something to happen that
                        you might have been the leader yourself in public because of your
                        professional capacity it was smarter to get someone else to actually get the
                        work. And they did not know how to run a press conference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: But I briefed them. With my American experience I could say the embassy
                    helped. And you know that thing was so successful that I heard later that the
                    Brigadier at Pollsmoor Prison called the warders and guys together and says,
                    “Listen, no matter what happens, nothing must happen to these seven kids in
                    prison. They must be given VIP treatment, and even if it means they can walk
                    freely in the corridors,” which happened, “they must be treated like VIPs in
                    this place.”</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>When I came to the U.S. in '87, the newspaper interviewed me about all this. I
                    don't know how they knew that I was involved in this, but they interviewed me.
                    It was a front page article. But then you see those kids were not scared because
                    we had psychologists counseling them before they went in. They were given VIP
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the sentences hold? One three and five years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, one three and five years. I think the kid who had five years he
                    was the eighth one who skipped the country. But you don't serve three years. You
                    serve about less than a year if you are sentenced to three years. But they all
                    were sentenced and they were not scared. When this very nice girl married as a
                    kid. So we did a lot of work. It cost a lot of work. It was as I said I stuck my
                    neck out there. If it had gone the wrong way, but I think I protected myself by
                    not being visible. Nobody could point a finger at Frank Sassman being at the
                    press conference, that all was packed. You had all the local journalists. You
                    had the international media representatives were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this case, you were not doing this as a government
                        employee, you were doing this as an individual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: In my personal capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The strategy of not being visible, any more thoughts about
                        that? Let's say you did represent the government and you were instructed by
                        your peers to do something and be invisible, would you have the same
                        enthusiasm for that as the circumstances where you were a person not
                        comparable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, I don't think it is comparable because I did this primarily because
                    of my niece being involved you know. My sister's daughter. I did that. I must
                    stress that these were trumped up charges. These kids were not involved in
                    terrorism. It was just taking eight school kids. They must have been told take
                    these kids, and we want to show other learners that you are going to prison of
                    you go to these rallies. So I think it wouldn't have been the same had I been
                    given. For instance when the Truth Commission came, The BPAO and the political
                    officer came to me and they said they wanted me to go and be at these hearings
                    and report back. Now that was an official assignment, understand. But I think if
                    I say the way I did it, I just took it for myself that the embassy would not be
                    happy with me arranging that press conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One more question, the eight kids arrested, can you
                        remember the year that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: That was in the early 80's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The notion of brinksmanship, you had a confrontation
                        between two governments working and sometimes with the same goals and
                        sometimes with opposite goals. If you were smart enough you could use
                        strategies. You were this marvelous ploy that you mentioned of a person not
                        giving a passport might be financially reliable which is a total bluff. But
                        there was some point of leverage where the South African officials you tell
                        this, they feared they had doubts. You had the ability or you developed the
                        ability to find the weak points of the apartheid people, the individuals.
                        Any general comments at this time. I think we will come up with this many
                        times because this is really the story of what you have done, it is
                        brinkmanship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Let me try and answer that. You see I had this thing even before
                    Bob Gosende contacted me. I had a British guy that I knew who was a diplomat. I
                    wanted to make diplomacy my career, but I had many problems with that. If I had
                    to go and be a South African diplomat I had to go abroad and defend apartheid,
                    which my political ideology, principles would never allow me. But then I said
                    no, I want to be a diplomat, I mustn't let that deter me from achieving my
                    career goal. So I had a choice. I had to go and work for the British foreign
                    service or work for the Americans. But I never explored it. Very fortuitously
                    for me my career actions got Bob Gosende to give me a call, and Bob made me an
                    offer. And I told Bob, “Bob, look as now that fate has gone my way. I would have
                    liked to be a diplomat but there was no way I could work for my country and I
                    had to put it on the back burner.” So I said, “Bob, this is not an easy decision
                    for me because I am newly married.” I got married in '62 so I was married ten
                    years. My kids were young. I said, “I must do a lot of thinking about this
                    because if I make the wrong decision my family is going to suffer.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A decision about the offer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The job. So he said, “Frank, ok, I will give you two weeks to think
                    about it. You come back to me.” Then I thought and my decision was made by I
                    looked at the two societies, the British society, and the American society. I
                    saw the many parallels. Granted there are differences but the many parallels I
                    can draw between the South African and the American society. I read about Martin
                    Luther King and Jesse Jackson, and said, I would like to work for the Americans,
                    and then I accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: My credibility as a result of being in diplomatic circles have made me a
                    unique individual in this country. Guys who were cabinet now, I can pick up the
                    phone and say, “Listen, it is pay back time.” I opened that door for you. I need
                    to lay open guidance. So it made me a very unique individual in my family,
                    immediate family, in my extended family, and also in South Africa. I can go
                    anywhere in the country and I will run up against people for whom I have opened
                    the door. I always say to them, “I didn't get you the grant. You did things
                    which I noticed and I felt that you should benefit from this, so I merely
                    nominated you.” But they say, “I got them the grant. I don't see it that way. I
                    mean Phumzile who was the deputy president she told me, “Frank you opened the
                    door for me when I was a community worker with the western province council of
                    churches. Poralani, these are guys when the change came they came to me. They
                    said, “Frank we need to get to our peer group.” They didn't want the grants with
                    constructive engagement. They didn't want to be associated with us. Say Frank,
                    Neville Alexander came to me and said, “Frank I think I am ready to go now,” as
                    an example. So you know it is guys, and Hank, I did an electronic dialogue with
                    Hank Cohen who was the assistant secretary of state. I did this dialogue. Hank
                    said to the media, we had Cape Town linked up with the South African
                    parliamentarians, linked up with the media in three other centers in Africa to
                    talk about change in Africa. Where are we now, what is the status. Hank
                    Cohen...</p>
                <p>Hank Cohen made a statement in that particular electronic dialogue that I will
                    never forget, but very apt. He said to the guys, the South Africans he said
                    especially to the south African media, he said, “Listen, you guys are being very
                    negative towards change in South Africa. You always are talking about the
                    problems, but you are not offering solutions to the problems. Start focusing on
                    how you are going to resolve the situation. I want to tell you this, the time
                    for change is much nearer than you think. Don't Get caught with your pants
                    down,” were his last words.</p>
                <p>You know I had a call from , who was it that called me, Bulelani Ngcuka who was
                    very high up. He was the guy the ANC brought into Western to organize the
                    Western Cape you know. Mass media, mass democratic movement in the western cape.
                    He called me. He said, “Frank, you know, that electronic dialogue set us
                    thinking. Can you bring, can you link us up with three specialists in the United
                    States, who are specialists in electoral processes. Because after what Cohen
                    said, we thought, we didn't even focus on what the electoral process we are
                    going to use. I went to my director, at the time my countrymen didn't know who
                    it was. I said to him, “Listen, we must help these guys.” This is now we looking
                    at '92, the early 90's where there was the change. They were now talking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ....1994.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, so they taking with electoral processes now and are having
                    discussions with the South African government. This guy, he said no. They
                    cannot, this is too short. We can't get these guys. I said, “Man, these guys are
                    not going to stop with you.” They are going to go to the political office, they
                    are going to go to the ambassador. USIS can look good if we... I went behind his
                    back.. I called Kent Obie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The director of the Africa bureau at USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: At that time Kent was PAO. But he became the head. So Ken at least saw,
                    I said to Kent, “Look I know the time is short. I concur with that. They wanted
                    to go within two weeks.” So I said, “But can't we do an electronic dialup?” He
                    said, “Excellent Frank, we are going to look at this.” They lined up Andre
                    Lypot, who was at the University of California, Sam Huntington, and another
                    guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sam Huntington. Another electronic...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, yeah. Guys like the ANC now — this was the shadow ANC, Kader
                    Asmal, Albie Sachs. Albie Sachs came to me and he said “What about this horse
                    and pony show that you arranging?” They didn't know about electronic dialogue. I
                    said, and they were having a conference in Stellenbosch. I said, “Ok, we are
                    going now.” They lined up those guys and they had the electronic dialogue. Kader
                    Asmal, Dullah Omar, they were all there. So we had this, and you know, we booked
                    an hour. Within the first half an hour, Albie and Kader, and Dullah came to me
                    and said, “Frank, we must apologize. We were taunting you about the horse and
                    pony show. We didn't know about the electronic dialogue. But the guys want to
                    know if you can give us an extra half an hour.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ha, ha, ha, ha!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And we had it, and there they discussed. Then these guys came to me and
                    said to me, “Frank, we are not disrespecting you, but we know the trouble you
                    had going direct to the ambassador. We want a dedication to go into act further
                    with these guys.” So you see then this is why I was helping my government
                    through my job. I was doing my job but very subtly, I was helping, and I wasn't
                    doing anything wrong, understand. Because that is the idea. You wanted to share
                    the U.S. experience with host country nationals. So many times I did my mission,
                    but in a beneficial way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Frank, I have known you long enough to know you were
                        always a trouble maker and will always be a trouble maker, but always the
                        trouble gave good results.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Gave a benefit. So I tell you that to me was a high light, and the fact
                    that these guys would pick up the phone and call, they would say, “Frank we are
                    coming to you.” They could have gone to the ambassador., but they come to me and
                    they say how much we approach you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the Albie Sachs people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, they respected me, and then when we started sending them and the
                    approach to the U.S. government changed and they knew they had to draw on the
                    expertise of the U.S. models, they came, and they came to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were people who were ideologically suspicious of the
                        United States. But who came to understand through your guidance that the
                        models in the United States existed and they needed those models.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They wanted, Look, why re-invent the wheel. The thing is as I say I was
                    honored then in the sense that I was at the branch office [Cape Town]. I wasn't
                    at the head office. They could have called someone in Pretoria but they called
                    me. And I said, I thought my BPAO at that time wouldn't want to act. I said, “No
                    I am going to call Kent.” And Kent will see it the way I see it. And exactly we
                    had a good working relationship and he saw it and now Frank, we must. Same with
                    the Vaal and all this. If I didn't get the support from Pretoria, you know how
                    it works. It goes into the waste bin.</p>
                <p>That is why I value having you guys up there and being able to. That I admired
                    about you guys. You always showed an interest outside of your portfolio you know
                    wanting to know this or wanting to know that. But maybe it is not a
                    generalization. I am not saying everybody, but the people I meet, I meet the
                    wrong people. But I don't get any invitations for embassy functions. I
                    understand why, if I am there, the guys all know me, the contacts are going to
                    come to me because we were not just professional contacts; we were friends. That
                    may be good for the mission. So I don't know if that is the reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are a very difficult person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. So I said I just go there to change my check.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well there is much to be said about the present and how
                        things have changed, but this is all the more important that we understand,
                        we are talking about history here, a bit of narrative history that is
                        extremely important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And you now, I know that I became a friend of these guys as opposed to
                    just a contact because on many occasions the ambassador or the BPAO would ask
                    another colleague to call and make an appointment. And that when a big guy comes
                    from Washington, the ambassador would contact me and say “Frank, can you try?”
                    And then I will get the appointment. Because my, and again I won't share this
                    with anybody but I can mention in my interview. I when I had my contact cards
                    for all this computer technology, I had little contact cards. I will say my
                    contact is Dan Whitman. The most important point I would put after I would put
                    Dan Whitman's details is the name of your personal assistant or secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For access.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Then they would say to you “Hi Jenny can I owe you.” “You know they told
                    me so many times Frank you are the only person who makes us visible. Everybody
                    just calls Hello can I speak to Dan Whitman.” That got me the entr�e, or if I
                    speak to Jenny, “Hi how is the family?” “Ah my little boy broke his leg,” and
                    all that. I know that. Next time I call I say, “how's John? How is his leg?” “Oh
                    Frank you impress me again.” I always like Jakes said to me once. _____ Are you
                    having an affair with Cathy?” Cathy was the secretary. I said, “Why do you say
                    that?” He says, “When you call, you are the only one and you are making a time
                    to make an appointment,” Cathy comes and pleads with me to say why don't you do
                    it over breakfast. Frank has got something important. The guys could never
                    figure out, but that was my little secret. That I had this card and I would
                    always put these things down. That is why I could get an appointment, even the
                    mayor of Cape. She would say Joyce came there, Joyce says please, you must go.
                    Frank has been calling. So it was my way just my personality that interested in
                    people and I am a people person. That is what I would do, and I would never, I
                    mean I am outing it now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to tell you at the Foreign Service Institute people
                        take courses in how to get access to important people, be nice to the
                        subordinate, but must people never learn the lesson. And this you came on
                        all by yourself.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: This focused very heavily on the Group Areas Act which called for the
                    countries to be divided into geographic regions or housing areas for the
                    different ethnic groups. Before they could do that they had to assign a racial
                    classification to every citizen in the country. Now this took various forms, and
                    I will try to put into context and try to explain to you how it was done. If in
                    the case the child would always get the race of the mother. Except where the
                    father and the mother is not of the same race. If you take a white female, if
                    she is married to a white person, the child would be classified as white. If
                    there has been sex across the color line, and the mother is white but the father
                    happens to be colored, African, or Indian, that child would be classified as
                    colored. In the case of the colored woman, the child would always be classified
                    as colored whether the father is white, colored, African or Indian. In the case
                    of the African woman, the child would be classified as and this refers to the
                    Indian.</p>
                <p>In the case of the Indian woman the child would be classified if the father is
                    Indian, the child would be classified as Indian. If the father is colored or the
                    father is African, or the father is white, and the mother is and Asiatic woman,
                    they child would be classified as colored. Now if you take the African woman and
                    the Child, the father is white, colored or Indian. That child would be
                    classified as colored, and if the father and the mother is African the child
                    would be classified as African. But then you have borderline cases where in all
                    the other cases they are not so much concerned with physical features, but in
                    the case of where the person that has to be classified is a borderline case, in
                    other words he or she claims to be colored, but the features is more African,
                    the person is really dark of complexion, has very short hair, and that is
                    normally the physical features for as we said, Africans. Afrikaner said for the
                    colored for the African. Then they would use cultural differences prevalent
                    between the two groups colored versus African.</p>
                <p>Now one of the things they would have if a person comes and he claims that he is
                    colored because it is better to be colored than African because you have more
                    privileges, you know, economic privileges, job privileges etc. So that person
                    will come and he will say that he is colored he is not African. But he has the
                    features of the African. Now the Afrikaner guy interviewing that person will use
                    different things. The first thing they would use is what they call the pencil
                    test. They will take a pencil and the person has short pepper corn hair, they
                    will put the pencil. If the pencil sticks he is African. If the pen goes through
                    he is colored. Then it got around and that is because he is very wise, and he
                    shaved his head so they couldn't use the pencil test.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Then they had other tests that were cultural tests. The person interviewing the
                    person who is very dark of complexion, short hair and looks African but claims
                    to be colored. They will them to get him to say certain phrases which the
                    colored and the African will say differently pronunciations or whatever. They
                    would have the one, there is a word you all know, Jackal which is a small
                    animal. They will say to him say that word in Afrikaans. Now the Afrikaans word
                    for Jackal is Jakkals. Jakkals is the Afrikaans word for Jackal. The colored if
                    he is colored he will say Jakkals. If he is African, the African has difficulty
                    he will say Jackolas. If he says Jackolas, he is classified as African. If he
                    says Jakkals, then he is colored. Then there is another phrase I catch the ghost
                    in the dark. Now that is English. You understand that. But then in Afrikaans
                    that would be Ek vang Die spoek in die donker. Now that guy who claims to be
                    colored but he looks African, the Afrikaner will ask him to say that. The
                    colored, if they have him classified as colored will say Ek vang any spoek in e
                    donker. The African the way he speaks and the cultural difference will say Ek
                    Vang home die spoek in die donker. So that is the difference and on that phrase,
                    they also used this with there was a time when there was the prohibition laws
                    that Africans could not buy spirits or alcohol from a bottle store. Because if
                    you are African you are not allowed to buy spirits or wine. But coloreds could.
                    When a guy comes in dark of complexion and short hair, they would use these
                    phrases to determine whether that guy is colored or whether he is African.</p>
                <p>Then there was another cultural difference, and that was the person interviewing
                    the person who claims he is colored and not African, he would say to them in
                    English or Afrikaans “How tall were you when you were sixteen years old?” You
                    understand how tall. The African because he grew up mostly in the rural
                    environment and the way they measure horses he will say I was so high and he
                    would show with his hands that way. The colored and the white will show like
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah with the hand flat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Now you see that with a horse they always say a horse is 20 hands
                    high.</p>
                <p>Coloreds and whites would show the hand horizontal to show the height. And that
                    is another way they would. There was another phrase that sounds a bit
                    complicated. There is a phrase in Afrikaans, “Eighty-eight small potatoes.” In
                    Afrikaans you would say “agt en Tagtig ard appels.” that is potatoes. Agt en
                    tagtig klein ard appelkis.” Now the African has trouble saying this. The colored
                    would say, “Agt en tagtig ard appelkis.” But the African cannot say that. He has
                    problems so he would say “tagentagentag.” You see the difference. So in that the
                    race will be decided. So I just thought I wanted to show this stupidity. The
                    stupidity in all race...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there must have been people who knew this and were
                        able to fake it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, but it was very difficult where you have a culture that you say
                    something in one way, and it was say it fast, you know. Then he catches you up.
                    There were some really interesting incidents. I will give you one incident in
                    Dansani, that is the black town near to East London. This family lived in East
                    London but during some time when the classification took place, the family was
                    struggling. They sent, this was a colored family, and they sent the one daughter
                    to live with her mother's sister. This daughter was young and she lived many
                    years with the mother's sister. Then the mother's sister married a black African
                    guy. So she was classified as African. They reclassified her as black
                    African.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though these were not her biological parents.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The mother's sister was married to an African, and she had herself
                    reclassified as African, but she had the colored daughter of her sister who
                    should have been classified as colored. But they didn't want to say you are
                    living in an African village, so they classified the daughter when they did the
                    general classifications, they classified the daughter as African.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they could live together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right. She was in an African area. So this daughter when the mother's
                    situation changed she went back to live with her mother in this area in East
                    London. Of course everybody carried an identity document. White, coloreds, and
                    Indians had an identity document, the ID. Africans had to carry the sompass or
                    the pass. Under the influx control laws they couldn't come into the urban areas
                    just as they want to. So when the authorities came around and they asked them
                    for their identity documents, it turned out that the daughter was African and
                    she is living in an area designated for coloreds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she had to redesignate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, so they said this daughter cannot live with you. She must get out of
                    the area. She is an African and she is living in a colored area by virtue of
                    this thing that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So once you are “demoted” colored to African, you cannot
                        go back.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: At that time you must now get out. So then the mother and father went to
                    consult an attorney and the attorney said to her, “The only way you can get your
                    daughter to live with you as an African is to build a servant's quarters in the
                    back of your yard. An employer as your domestic servant. Then a colored domestic
                    servant can live in a colored area by virtue of the fact that she is working for
                    a colored family as a domestic servant.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Amazing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever meet Helen Suzman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yes, I met Helen in of course. Parliament was part of my portfolio and
                    in working that area, and she was at one time the only female member of
                    parliament. And the only opposition member also. So I had contact with her. When
                    I was studying at the University of California in San Diego, they were showing
                    like they do they show to the students at the universities new releases of the
                    movies so they can go advertise what the films are like. So they showed Cry
                    Freedom. My involvement in Cry Freedom was that I was involved in the beginnings
                    and the gathering of information to make the movie. I had a call from Donald
                    Woods who was the editor of the daily dispatch who skipped the country in the
                    70's or early 80's I think. He was banned with Steve Biko. He called me and
                    said, “Frank, Sir Richard Attenborough wants to make a movie on South Africa.”
                    He didn't know if that was going to be on Steve Biko, but he said he needed to
                    get somebody to get him around. I then told my director and he said, “Oh Frank
                    it is an honor if you can help Sir Richard, so you can go.” I introduced Sir
                    Richard with contemporaries of Steve Biko.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Steve Biko was killed in the 70's.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, in the 70's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this film was the story of Steven Biko.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, on the life of Steve Biko. Steve Biko was the father of black
                    consciousness in this country he was a medical student who was expelled and ...
                    In any case I met Sir Richard so he said to me in Cape Town he said to me, “I am
                    not here on my real name. I am using a pseudonym. I didn't because he said the
                    South African filming had invited him to the premier of Gandhi the film which he
                    made before “Cry Freedom.”</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Because the cinemas were segregated under the Group Areas Act. He didn't want to
                    accept because he was not happy with segregation of audiences, so this is his
                    year to make a film and he doesn't want the authorities to know so he was here
                    as Mr. Green. I took him around. I took him to Crossroads. I took him to the
                    Eastern Cape. He took stills you know and he still said to me, “Frank thank you
                    very much. I have got enough background I can make this fall any way I want.
                    Even if they don't allow me back in the country.” When I took him to Peter Jones
                    who was the closest friend of Steve Biko, he was a colored, to his office in
                    Stellenbosch, We didn't know the office was bugged. Peter then called him Sir
                    Richard. The next morning the “Burger,” you know the story of the “Burger.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Afrikaans morning newspaper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The daily paper. It was the mouth organ of the Nationalist Party. They
                    picked up the security police listening in to our conversations. The next
                    morning the “Burger” has a story headlines, Sir Richard Attenborough is in South
                    Africa to make a film on the life of Steve Biko. Sir Richard told me he also
                    wants to meet Winnie Mandela because Nelson Mandela was still in prison. This
                    was in the early 80's. So he said to me he is going up to Brantford. Now
                    Brantford is a small African village in the Free State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is after you knew that the Burger had run the
                        story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah after we knew. So then he went up and he was speaking. Now Winnie
                    being a banned person, you cannot meet, you cannot be two people to give her
                    simultaneously. You need more than two people to get her simultaneously. Two
                    people is allowed but three or more you violate the banning order. So he met
                    with Winnie, and there was a journalist according to Sir Richard standing
                    approximately twenty yards away from where Sir Richard was talking to Winnie
                    Mandela. A Journalists with a conservative white newspaper said he overheard Sir
                    Richard planning with Winnie Mandela the overthrow of the South African
                    government. Now you tell me 20 yards away and obviously speaking softly and</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes and using listening devices or lying, one or the
                        other.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Then of course, Sir Richard left. Then when I heard the film was being
                    released in San Diego, I had to see this film because I knew it was going to be
                    banned in our country. Now we under the prohibition laws. And they would have a
                    foolscap sized loose leaf like an encyclopedia on all the banned material. It
                    would be one liners, Title and order. It would have about plus minus 800 pages
                    printed with one line for each. It showed you how many books were banned.
                    Sometimes the censor board would reset a second week and list all the
                    literature. Calendars would be banned. Films would be banned under the
                    prohibition. These things would be banned and all libraries had to have list of
                    what is called Jacobson's, a list of objectionable literature. The libraries
                    have got to check that list against their book stock to make sure that they
                    don't have banned books on the shelves. If you are caught with a banned book,
                    and I am talking about the 70's and 80's you would be fined about 800 Rand,
                    about 80 Dollars. So and sometimes because they cannot, people would fall into
                    the sense of order and object. Sometimes they would look purely at titles. At
                    one time they banned Black Beauty by Ann Sorrel, the story about the horse. The
                    banned it because they saw the word black in the title. The books were banned
                    primarily for political content, for pornography and a lot of sex in the novel
                    and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, let's go back to the Attenborough film in Los
                        Angeles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, so I was sitting and watching this film because I assumed it would
                    be banned. I heard someone say, “Frank, what are you doing in Los Angeles?”
                    George Allen's sister. She went to university in the east to do a memorial,
                    annual memorial lecture. Then she came to the University of California in San
                    Diego to do the memorial lecture at the San Diego. So I said, “I see I am here
                    for the same reason as you. You won't be able to see this movie in South Africa
                    because of the banning laws. The other thing I remember about Ellen Sussman was
                    one of the speeches in parliament she was addressing parliament and one of the
                    national party MP's got up and said, “I don't agree with what you are saying
                    because statistics, if I can bring the statistics in it will prove otherwise.”
                    So Ellen Sussman laughed and she aid , “Let me tell you something about
                    statistics. Statistics is like a woman's bikini. It hides and covers up the
                    vital parts and reveals the ephemeral unimportant parts.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She said that right in parliament?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right. So she was a person, a real fighter very feisty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was amazing and constantly in opposition as you say. I
                        think every day just about that she was in that room.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: She was the only opposition MP.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was white which is how I guess she was able to
                        survive. But politically how did she survive, because she was all alone in
                        that room.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I will give you my personal opinion. You see, if any country as South
                    Africa claims to be a Western country, is a one party state, and it has no
                    opposition ,it is very bad. It is bad for investment in the country you see. So
                    the top business people were Anglo-American. They found a sponsor. So I think at
                    that time it was purely to give credibility to the white Nationalist Party. They
                    have an opposition, only one person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they permitted an opposition as a safety valve to give
                        the impression of being pluralistic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: It is good and it is democratic. There is an opposition. One person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were confident that everyone would ignore
                        her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and what is she going to do, one person against them. But by the
                    end of course the thing grew and at that time it was the progressive federal
                    party. Today they are the official opposition to the Democratic alliance which
                    came out of the PFP, the official opposition to the Party, the ruling party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where are we chronologically. We are in the early 80's
                        You were in California on a trip, on a study trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>:SASSMAN: It was, I did not go under the auspices of the USIS. It was an American
                    exchange program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were in, was it a coincidence that you were in Los
                        Angeles at the time of the premier of the Attenborough film?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I was doing research at the University of California at San Diego.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you had worked on this movie. It was very important
                        for you to see this movie. You knew it would be banned in south Africa, and
                        there was Helen Suzman sitting near you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and she for the same reason she was also there. It happened that
                    the movie was released at the time when she came to give this memorial lecture.
                    So that was quite and experience and Sir Richard thanked me personally for
                    taking him around and getting... But I must say the fact that office was bugged,
                    Sir Richard obviously was informed back then by Donald Woods, because Donald
                    Woods had a lot of problems with the Security police. He was very paranoid about
                    places being bugged. But when I started speaking to him at the hotel, the
                    Turner's Hotel, he showed me, “Let's go outside.” We spoke outside.</p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Attenborough was very paranoid about bugging. The next day we are in
                    Peter Jones' office, nobody knowing he spoke there the place was bugged. That is
                    how the Burgher, the security police told the Burgher to publish the story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the story came out, how long was Attenborough able
                        to stay in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: After the story I think after he met with Winnie, he ended what he
                    wanted to do, so he left. But he wrote to Donald who was living in exile in the
                    UK because he was banned, living in exile in the UK, and Donald called me to say
                    Sir Richard said to say think you very much. He has got enough stills and
                    material he can make that film anywhere in the world. He wasn't allowed back
                    into South Africa to make the film. He made it in Harare, in Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the same terrain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know whether he ever returned to South Africa
                        later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he had the material thanks to Frank Sassman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And he gave me a credit on the fold, under the fold. So it was a very
                    interesting period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess. I should say so. Let's go chronologically. This
                        would have been the early mid 80's I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I was in the States at San Diego in '87.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your experience with Attenborough was just before
                        then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, well that could have been '86 or early '87 when I took him around.
                    He was making Chorus Line, another movie at the time, but he was doing the
                    research. He had done the research for Chorus Line and they were busy with the
                    movie. He was now doing the research for his next movie which was something on
                    South Africa. But in the beginning he didn't know whether it was going to be the
                    life of Steve Biko, was it going to be on Apartheid or something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you have mentioned Steve Biko as being the father of
                        Black Consciousness. Any other comments about Steve Biko before we leave
                        that subject.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, Steve Biko was the South African authorities were really scared of
                    Steve Biko because he was a very eloquent speaker, very articulate and not
                    scared you know, very assertive in putting his point across. He started from the
                    premise of black consciousness that we cannot have normality in South African
                    society...</p>
                <p>Unless we level the playing fields where blacks are equal to whites in this
                    country. So his organization which was AZAPO, he was first AZAPO and then he
                    went to the Black People's congress, the Black Consciousness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AZAPO is an acronym.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Azanian People's Organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say this was the precursor to the ANC? Was there
                        any...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Oh they are to the left of the ANC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of these movements seen as radically left by the
                        regime?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. They were banned. They were all banned. So Steve Biko was, a
                    directive was given to the security police that he is a prominent fugitive
                    African leader and he must be taken out. In other words they must kill him. Then
                    he was on his way to a rally in the Eastern Cape and then outside Grahamstown,
                    you know where the old university is in the Eastern Cape. They stopped, the
                    security police stopped the vehicle and arrested Biko and Peter Jones who was
                    the Secretary of the Black Consciousness movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know the year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: In the late 70's. Then Peter Jones was released and he was banned. And
                    also threatened because he was in the cell next to Biko. And they beat up Steve
                    Biko and when they put him in the back of a buggy, this is a small van.</p>
                <p>They drove from Grahamstown to Pretoria which is 1500 kilometers. Which would be
                    about 800-900 miles. Just naked in this buggy they drove with him, and he died
                    in Pretoria. It eventually came out that the police beat him to death. He was
                    killed by them. Just one incident that I always remember about Steve Biko and
                    his assertiveness and being prepared to speak out irrespective of who he was
                    talking to. He was being tried at the supreme court at that time which is not a
                    high court in Grahamstown for his political activities. The magistrate at one
                    point in the trial said to him, “Mr. Biko, why do you keep referring to yourself
                    as black when you are actually dark brown?”</p>
                <p>Now the black consciousness, they did not accept the term native or colored or
                    whatever. They just saw black and white. So black consciousness was black. He
                    smiled and said, “Your honor with all due respect, why do you refer to yourself
                    as white when you are actually pink?” It just brought the roof down in the
                    court. But that was Steve. He says it as it is you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that doesn't make things any easier for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, he was sentenced.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meanwhile you are back from California, is that

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah.</p>

                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah not the next thing that happened, I told you before I went to the
                    U.S. I was with the Weinberg crisis, it was an NGO non profit. I was involved
                    with that to help the seven kids who were sentenced to various
                    imprisonments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were employed by USIS. Extra curricular
                        activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, extra curricular. I didn't tell them about that. I did everything
                    behind the scenes. I briefed people but didn't actually participate in the
                    thing. Then when I came back, it was in '87, I came back, what happened after
                    that. Then in the next significant thing that happened in my life was when
                    because of the grapevine and my connections with the ANC, I heard two days, I
                    heard this on the grapevine two days before the release of Mandela I heard this.
                    I went to the Ambassador and informed him that Mandela would be released in two
                    days time. The ambassador was very impressed and he said to me, “Frank if you
                    can go back and ask the ANC leadership who will be planning the release if they
                    can take it to a venue where President Bush Sr. Can be the first international
                    statesman to call him and congratulate him on his release it would be a major
                    coup for the embassy. So Bill Swing was the ambassador. You must know. So Bill
                    said to me, “Frank if you can do that it is a major thing.”</p>
                <p>I went back to the University of the Western Cape where they were planning all of
                    this and spoke to him sub rosa, spoke to Dullah Omar, explained to them what the
                    ambassador's wish was. So they said, “Frank this would be good.” And they are
                    going to make it happen. They in turn asked me if the embassy would lend a
                    bullet proof vehicle to drive Mandela around in the country. I said to them I
                    cannot answer, but I will take your request to the ambassador, which I did. I
                    didn't hear anything. I don't know if it happened or whether they said no they
                    cannot. It is not possible to give a U.S. government vehicle to a civilian. I
                    don't know what happened; I heard nothing. Oh the ambassador then asked me to
                    get the telephone number. So I went back to them and got the telephone number
                    where they were taking Mandela and President Bush called him. That happened. The
                    telephone call happened. They took him to Dullah's house before he spoke to the
                    crowd.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dullah Omar, later minister of justice.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: He became minister of justice. So this is the way it was described to me
                    by guys who were at the event when he was at Dullah's house. The phone rang and
                    Dullah's daughter who is now an advocate ran to the phone and she came back and
                    she said, “Daddy, there is a man on the telephone. He says he is the President
                    of the United States, and he wants to speak to Mandela.” Now you must know
                    Dullah, and Kader Asmal they all laughed thinking it is Dan Whitman playing a
                    joke on them. Dullah went to the phone and it was President Bush. Mandela
                    mentions the incident in his book, “The Long Walk to Freedom.” He doesn't
                    mention any names but he mentions that it was at Dullah's house. He says he
                    valued this phone call because the reason he valued it Bush placed him on his
                    list of 27 people that he regularly informs or briefs on international
                    incidents. He valued that because remember he was incarcerated for 27 years and
                    he was out of touch with a lot of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well this is enormous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That is the one thing. The other thing he said was that he had a great
                    respect for Bush. He was a man that you can debate with. Bush always took
                    cognizance of the feelings of the person he was interacting with, and that you
                    can leave after the debate or the discussion and still respect him. Those are
                    the two things. I actually have the page number. I think it is 699, but I can
                    look that up in the Long Walk to Freedom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Now a couple of questions about this. You say you learned
                        two days before. Was there a general sense that this was imminent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah there was. Look at what had happened. You see you can't have a
                    person incarcerated for 27 years just released into society. So what they did
                    they allowed him privileges on Robben Island. Then I don't know if they had a
                    special house built in Victor Verster Prison in Paarl. They didn't release him
                    immediately into society. They first took him from Robben Island to Victor
                    Verster where he was allowed more privileges. He had visitors and all that. Then
                    the release was done from Victor Verster Prison.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So everybody knew this would be coming soon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, at the time when I heard it people knew they were going to release
                    him at some time but nobody knew when. So it was a very good news to the embassy
                    because they knew two days before it was going to happen by virtue of me having
                    heard it from senior aides.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now it was the ambassador's decision that it would be a
                        good thing for the president to be the first one to call. Do we know Whether
                        President Bush had an opinion about this or did he just follow the advice of
                        the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I think when I did this through my BPAO so of course Bill Swing said,
                    “Look, this is good news,” when he met with his political officers. Then he
                    said, “If Frank can go and get the ANC echelons to get Mandela to a telephone
                    where President Bush can call him to be the first international statesman to
                    congratulate him it would be a major coup for the embassy in South Africa.”</p>
                <p>But then what I think he did, and I can't vouch for this. I think he must have
                    communicated this to Washington saying Mandela is going to be released in two
                    days time. I have suggested that we arrange for you as president to call him. I
                    cannot say this with certainty but I think that is what he did. I think if I
                    were ambassador it would put me in good stead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We really don't know what the attitude was in Washington
                        but the upshot was that they followed the ambassador's advice.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They agreed and that is what happened. And as I say it happened, and
                    Mandela mentioned it in his book, and I also heard it from ANC guys.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My gosh. Now the perception in the majority population of
                        South Africa towards the U.S. administrations, the various ones was mixed, I
                        think. That is majority population black, colored, those in the anti
                        apartheid struggle had mixed feelings I think, about the U.S. policy. Now do
                        you think that President Bush and the release of Mandela made a very rapid
                        change in people's opinions about the United States and its policy towards
                        South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: You see, I think that the feelings were mixed with regard to the U.S.
                    you know. There were many people who saw the U.S. as the savior that is going to
                    get them out of the position they are in. There were many people who saw the
                    U.S. like with your Sullivan principles your embargoes, whatever you did. Most
                    of the people in South Africa saw the Sullivan principles and the embargoes as
                    good things that they said at least the U.S. the more radical ones, the AZAPO
                    guys, maybe some guys in the ANC, because to the left of the ANC it is still an
                    imperialist country. Are they genuine, what are they doing, you know that type
                    of thing. So you had mixed feelings. The other thing that was more important to
                    me was how Mandela saw this. He valued the opportunity that Bush placed him on
                    the list of the 27 people that he briefed regularly on international incidents.
                    Mandela just coming out of prison for 27 years, you can think what this meant
                    the top western leader is now going to be calling him and discussing important
                    issues with him. That to me is more important.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you have a man who has been a prisoner for 27 years a
                        U.S. president who apparently was very nimble and able to change very
                        quickly from whether you consider him justly imprisoned or not, he was a
                        prisoner. Bush had to be playing within a delicate position I guess because
                        there was Constructive Engagement. There were those in the U.S. who wanted
                        much more harsh treatment of the apartheid regime. It appears that in a very
                        short amount of time President Bush Sr. quickly adapted to the idea of
                        Mandela being the leader.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yes, let me answer that. If you remember the ANC was the main liberation
                    struggle movement, right. Then there was a split in the ANC, and the PAC, the
                    Pan Africanist Congress move to the left of the ANC when that organization was
                    formed. Now you had two liberation movements. ANC where they are moving in
                    condo. MKZ. Then you have the Pan Africanist Congress, PAC with APLA, the
                    African People's Liberation Army as the armed struggle. Both of them operated
                    from Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the PAC.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The PAC, more socialist than the ANC. So the U.S. chose to identify
                    Mandela as the leader that they will deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Seen as more moderate by the American administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: More moderate by the U.S. and the U.S. actually made Mandela. Let's put
                    it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a pretty strong statement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, because they accepted him and they pushed him as the Future leader
                    of South Africa you know. There had to be change and the oppression had to end.
                    They identified Mandela as the leader above all the other guys especially Robert
                    Soubouquet. And Robert Soubouquet as a result of that was played down by the
                    international community. He wasn't accepted as Mandela was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This could not have happened overnight. At what point did
                        the process accelerate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: It was there all the time. Look, the primary objective of the U.S. and
                    the west was to get the South African government to change. They tried various
                    things. They tried Constructive Engagement and different strategies. But when it
                    came to them getting to the South African, Botha actually started it, the
                    predecessor of de Klerk, this African leader. He started this by talking. But he
                    was very dogmatic and very opinionated, and things didn't go. But de Klerk was
                    the brave one who took the stand. Now I heard I don't know how true it is. It
                    makes sense to me, but I don't know if there is truth in this. When the talking
                    started and they get to have the big indaba in the center area where the ANC in
                    South Africa started talking and working out the new thing. Now I heard from
                    somebody and he said to me that the U.S. and the Soviet Union and others had to
                    force the hand of the South Africa government to force them to start talking to
                    the ANC. As I said I cannot prove this but I just heard people talking about
                    this. And then they said what was done that they came with sanctions, they came
                    with Sullivan principles, all these things leading up to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The U.S. working with the USSR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah this is what I heard. Let me explain this. What I heard was that
                    they then say they must break or hurt the economy of South Africa because
                    economics rules politics. So what they did was They sort of had to bring, you
                    see our economy is pegged against gold, it was all the years. So I heard that
                    the U.S. and some of the Western powers got together and said if we flood the
                    market with gold, and the U.S. has all it's gold. It doesn't produce that much,
                    so they said if they make an abundance of gold available, gold will drop in
                    value. And it dropped in value and they said the guys flooded the market, and
                    the value of the rand was 22 U.S. cents at that time. You know you can talk
                    until you are blue in the face, but if the economy suffers, and I think what
                    Mandela and Sisulu told them when they were talking as I told you earlier, that
                    if you do not negotiate with our age group in the ANC, you are going to face the
                    youth, and the youth wants an eye for an eye and blood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the U.S. see this is a potent threat, to devaluing the
                        South African currency. Was there ever an overt link to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That is what I say, I didn't hear that, and this is what I heard and it
                    makes sense to me. And immediately when the economy dropped to 22 U.S. cents,
                    the whole thing flowed you know and the talk for change came about. To me it
                    made sense that if you want to hurt somebody, and South Africa was always warned
                    pegging everything against gold in dangerous. That is also a conversation I was
                    in. I don't know how true it is but that is what brought about was the economic
                    change that forced them you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they had a false sense of security because South Africa
                        did produce gold. But South Africa was not the main holder of gold.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: If you look at Fort Knox. So I don't know it makes sense to me that if
                    there is an abundance the price will drop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What we can substantiate is that de Klerk was an
                        international visitor under the USIA system Tell us about that because he is
                        quoted as saying that his mind was completely changed about race relations.
                        That doesn't mean not to be simplistic not bad, good, but just different.
                        The whole equation was different for him after he was an official visitor of
                        the U.S. Information Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And you know that happened I think in the 80's because he was minister
                    of education at the time. He didn't go as president. But it can be sort of the
                    fact that he eventually ended up as president and that visit was important.</p>
                <p>

                        visit in the 80's that opened up, changed the equation, Maybe this made the
                        Stanton talks may have also been a factor in opening up. Now were these
                        talks secret talks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No they were open to the press. You are talking about the talk when the

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I think that he was nominated by a political officer but it was in the
                    80's. It could be the political officer in Cape Town, than that would be embassy
                    nomination. It wouldn't be a USIS nomination. But I worked on his program. I
                    worked on that. Because there was Barend du Plessis. He was minister of
                    finance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Sometimes I have to do the nomination with the political officer being
                    the nominee. Sometimes the political officer would do the nomination himself.
                    Sometimes I would have to go with the political officer and the BPAO to the
                    branch public affairs officer to deliver the letter. Then I would write up the
                    program suggestions by consulting the political officer, if he was a MP who
                    nominated him.</p>

                <p>SASSMAN: You see I can't remember if it was the early 80's I was doing the IV

                    can't remember the nomination which I think the political officer did by
                    himself. But program suggestions I think I had to contact the political officer
                    at the time to get that and write it up because he would sent whatever, and we

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well I worked on Barend du Plessis who was minister of finance. I worked
                    on his. His IV [Immigrant Visa]. I worked on the IV [International Visitor
                    program] of Willem Heath, the guy who became the head of the Heath investigative
                    unit into corruption in government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: IVs were not the only thing you were doing. You were
                        planning public meetings in Cape Town. You were dealing with Fulbrights I
                        think. Maybe that was Ron Hendricks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, Ron took it over from me, but when I started moving from the
                    library I did the whole exchange program, both the import and the exchange
                    program Ron was full librarian, and then Ron was promoted into the program.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>In the early 80's I was doing the Amparts [American Participants - expert
                    speakers brought from the U.S. to South Africa]. I was doing Fulbright. I was
                    doing the IVs, the exchange programs and Ron was the full librarian. Then I
                    think It was in the late 80's and Ron was promoted from full librarian to
                    cultural programs. Then we were sort of sharing it. It was very haphazard. Then
                    with one BPAO he said no. He wants to separate the cultural program. Say in
                    other words say have the person doing the programming. The programmer and the
                    other one would do the cultural exchanges. So then he said that look what we do
                    is we take one person in charge with the end part of the programming, and that
                    was me. And then Ron was in charge of the exchanges. Then they gave each one,
                    each programmer had sort of a portfolio, like I did social involvement and
                    politics and government. Now I would do all the programming on the overall
                    responsibility for the programming, but I would be my personal responsibility
                    would be falling in social involvement in politics and government. Ron would be
                    overall responsible for the cultural exchanges. In other words coordinating that
                    like I do the programming. But his area of specialty would be academia and
                    labor. So then if it is now exchanges than all the programs falling under
                    politics and government and social involvement I would handle that. I would
                    nominate for that with Ron coordinating. Petra was now in the media, Erfu was
                    media, so any exchanges in the media she would handle that reporting to Ron. So
                    the same would apply like for programming. I would be the overall coordinator
                    for programming. Ron would be responsible for programming imports in academia
                    and labor. Pietro would be responsible for imports in the media.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now in those days programming of Amparts generally did not
                        involve very large audiences. They used to be meeting with ministers and
                        academics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: One on one appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was your strategy then to have this have an impact
                        on the country because such a small number of people were involved. This was
                        before I-pods and Facebook and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: The way it worked, we had campus wide lectures. Where the Ampart would
                    go to UCT and have a campus wide lecture. We would go to the SRC and say do you
                    want. Most of our programs were seminars, round table discussions and symposia.
                    Like you would have, the other way we would use Amparts, if UCT the lawyers for
                    human rights, they had an international conference on human rights. So they
                    would contact me and say, “Frank we are doing this, is there a good person you
                    could bring from the U.S. to speak on your model for human rights at this
                    international conference?” That is another way to get the message of the model,
                    the U.S. model across. Then we would have one on one appointments like I did
                    with Deval Patrick who came out as an Ampart and get him to meet with the
                    minister of justice to have a one on one with his key guys in the ministry of
                    justice. So those are the ways a permutation of seminars, round table
                    discussions,. Even if we couldn't get a speaker out here we would opt for
                    electronic dialogue. Again we would get the parliamentary portfolio committee on
                    justice to speak about legislation pertaining to asset forfeiture, with
                    specialists in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now in 2009. Hillary Clinton is Secretary of State
                        and she has made it clear to the world that she believes in mass
                        communication with as many people simultaneously as possible. This is a very
                        new approach. Thinking back to the 80's and early 90's even where many of
                        the discussions were with select audiences, it was one on one. Did you feel
                        that the purpose of these on the part of the U.S. government was to convince
                        South Africans about an American point of view, or was the purpose to work
                        together for some common goal. Or were both things part of the program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: It was the target rifle approach as opposed to the shotgun. Where we
                    would get the appropriate person or people who can be influential in using that
                    particular U.S. model to get legislation here. It would be a more targeted
                    approach. Like I said, take for instance the portfolio committee on justice. We
                    would get them to speak or interact with a person on asset forfeiture and they
                    would speak directly to those two or three using electronic dialogue first and
                    then the whole committee going to interact with their peer group in there, there
                    were 22 members of that committee. So it was more that kind of approach as to
                    the large audience so it was smaller but more high powered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was a unique historic opportunity because you were
                        really into nation building even before 1994. You had institutions being
                        built. You had laws actually transforming the society so that this would not
                        be possible without the historic opportunity that you had.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: I had really enjoyed my work with USIS in the late 80's and early 90's.
                    I will tell you why. Because I was doing my job as an employee of the U.S.
                    government and simultaneously I was doing significant work for my own
                    government. Say when the new government came into power. The constitutional
                    assembly was established. Now the constituent assemble was the 400 members of
                    the House of Assembly and the Senate. At that time we still had the Senate. You
                    know the Senate was abolished and the National Council of Provinces was
                    established. But while we had the Senate and the National House of Assembly it
                    became very important that these two bodies became the constituent assembly</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are in the early 90's at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, we are looking at early 90's now. I would say late 80's early
                    90's. that is when the new parliament was established. That was in 1990, before
                    '92.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '92 was the release of Mandela. '94 was the election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: So I am talking about '94 now. But before that even, let's even go back
                    a little into the late 80's. There change was, people were talking about change,
                    but they don't know when it was going to happen. As I said to you that was the
                    time when we had that big interest, significant electronic dialogue with Hank
                    Cohen speaking to the media in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's tell this story. It is a very important story.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. So Hank Cohen did the first thing. It was an electronic dialogue
                    between Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he Assistant Secretary at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Assistant secretary of State for African Affairs. That was that time.
                    And he was the chief panelist for this electronic dialogue which was on changing
                    in Africa. We also had a linkup with Pretoria. A lot of our senior USIS guys and
                    some embassy people were there. Then we had Washington linked up. Then it was
                    also a link up in Africa. It was a four or five point linkup.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah other African countries because it was speaking to the media in
                    Africa. This is where as I said he focused on the thing addressing the media in
                    South Africa saying that South Africans are very critical of what is happening
                    in their country, talking about problems but lacking to discuss...</p>
                <p>, he was first AZAPO and then he went to the Black People's congress, the Black
                    Consciousness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AZAPO is an acronym.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Azanian People's Organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say this was the precursor to the ANC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Oh they are to the left of the ANC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they existed at the same time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yes. It was the same time but they were to the left of the ANC, you know
                    calling for nationalization. A lot of guys were first with AZAPO and the Black
                    Consciousness movement.</p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. They were banned. They were all banned. So Steve Biko was, a
                    directive was given to the security police that he is a prominent fugitive
                    African leader and he must be taken out. In other words they must kill him. Then
                    he was on his way to a rally in the Eastern Cape and then outside Grahamstown,
                    you know where the old university is in the Eastern Cape. They stopped, the
                    security police stopped the vehicle and arrested Biko and Peter Jones who was
                    the Secretary of the Black Consciousness movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know the year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That must have been I think it was in the late 70's. Then Peter Jones
                    was released and he was banned. And also threatened because he was in the cell
                    next to Biko. And they beat up Steve Biko and when they put him in the back of a
                    buggy, this is a small van.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: They put him in this buggy and drove from Grahamstown to Pretoria which
                    is 1500 kilometers. Which would be about 800-900 miles. Just naked in this buggy
                    they drove with him, and he died in Pretoria. It eventually came out that the
                    police beat him to death. He was killed by them. Just one incident that I always
                    remember about Steve Biko and his assertiveness and being prepared to speak out
                    irrespective of who he was talking to. He was being tried at the supreme court
                    at that time which is not a high court in Grahamstown for his political
                    activities. The magistrate at one point in the trial said to him, “Mr. Biko, why
                    do you keep referring to yourself as black when you are actually dark brown?”
                    Now the Black consciousness, they did not accept the term native or colored or
                    whatever. They just saw black and white. So black consciousness was black. He
                    smiled and said, “Your honor with all due respect, why do you refer to yourself
                    as white when you are actually pink?” It just brought the roof down in the
                    court. But that was Steve. He says it as it is you know.</p>

                    outspoken newspaper.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that national or Cape?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No it was based in East London in the Eastern Cape and was predominately
                    distributed in the Eastern Cape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was relative freedom of expression in the Daily
                        Dispatch.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or they just took it. They didn't...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Look, there was freedom of expression but it was limited. I will give
                    you an example. Oliver Tambo was in exile in the UK. Tony Heard was the editor
                    of the Cape Town Times, I am talking now about the late 70's early 80's. He went
                    and he did an interview with Oliver Tambo in London. His mother had to have an
                    operation and he went there. And then Donald Woods arranged for him to do this
                    interview. Tony came back, consulted with people, and at that time the law said
                    you cannot quote a banned person in any newspaper, literature. They will ban the
                    book if he is quoted in there. So Tony knew what the situation was. A very brave
                    thing he did. When he came back two days later, he published the whole question
                    answer interview verbatim. In the Cape Times. The English Morning daily
                    newspaper.</p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Tony Heard published, and he knew that he is going to be in trouble, and
                    he knew that it was under the law there was freedom of expression but you are
                    not allowed, let's say limited freedom of expression. The next day the security
                    police came to interrogate him, and Tony was arrested and he was kicked out of
                    the paper because you know the editorial board of the owners were still very
                    conservative. And he as an editor was a prodigy of Donald Woods, who was very
                    liberal. But he knew what he was doing. This is going to happen. So Tony was
                    kicked out as the editor of the Cape Times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that the worst thing that happened to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yes. Because he did that to freelance to survive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he has a wife and lost his job. Steven Biko was beaten
                        to death. There is a difference there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: So and then he came back. He became the somebody who writes the speeches
                    for the minister, Speech writer for the minister. So he became the speechwriter
                    for Kader Asmal who was the minister of education, and then Kader became
                    minister of water affairs and he took Tony over with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after Mandela became president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah in the new regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kader Asmal, an important name that will be referring to
                        because he had various portfolios.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, he was chairman of the national executive committee of the ANC
                    which governed, you know they were crucial as far as governing and deciding
                    policy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: He was a minister of education and a member of parliament, then he
                    became minister of water affairs. He is also a constitutional expert. He was a

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, they challenged that all the time but it was a limited freedom of
                    expression with the banning, and things like that and certain people wouldn't be
                    allowed to be quoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You might remember when Deval Patrick came in about '96,
                        when he was working in the Clinton prosecutor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Deputy Attorney General. I first thought of Deval Patrick I think it was
                    the mid 90's. It was during a time when we were preparing for a black history
                    month program. I normally as part of the black history month program through
                    electronic dialogue with an appropriate specialist in the United States. I saw
                    Time Magazine and I think Deval was on the cover of Time Magazine. I had no
                    knowledge of him. When I read about the man I thought I would like to include
                    him through USIA as a panelist on the U.S. side for this electronic dialogue. I
                    successfully recruited Deval Patrick through USIA for the February black history
                    month program he was our panelist for the U.S. side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Electronic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. And what his presentation really impressed not only me but my
                    American counterparts and South Africans. Immediately myself and the branch
                    public affairs office spoke and I said, “Look I would like to include him as an
                    American participant to physically come out to South Africa.” My branch public
                    affairs officer at USIS agreed and we contacted our Pretoria office who also
                    agreed. Duvall Patrick came out as an American participant. I programmed him to
                    do a round table discussion. It was on civil right legislation he did a round
                    table discussion. One of my one on one appointments that I set up for him was
                    with the minister of justice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dullah Omar.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Minister Dullah Omar, in 120 Plein Street which is the headquarters
                    housing, the parliamentary building housing all the ministers for the various
                    portfolios. At that meeting was the minister Dullah Omar, one of the senior
                    staff members who he sent the moment. The chief legal advisor to the South
                    African government and two other individuals. Dullah was, the minister of
                    justice was very impressed with Deval and who had the experience of monitoring
                    and seeing to the implementation of civil rights legislation in the Americans
                    with Disabilities Act in the office of the Attorney General at that time. When
                    Deval Patrick left the room to tend to something, while he was gone the minister
                    of justice gave a nod and said, “We need this guy, and you guys must try and
                    bring him out here again.” Ok, we came back and the minister was then telling
                    Duvall Patrick with the change from the White government to a black government,
                    the White government at the time was scared that the black minister of justice
                    was now going to get at people implemented by their policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Retribution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. So he said to Deval in order to put in place a mechanism that will
                    prevent this at that time before the change of the new government, the ANC
                    government</p>
                <p>We had four provinces and each province had a white attorney general. The old
                    regime, the Nationalist Party Regime gave carte blanche powers to these four
                    attorneys general to decide who has to be prosecuted. So they had yea or nay as
                    far as prosecution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were white attorneys general from the previous
                        regime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: From the previous regime, who headed the four provinces that we had at
                    that time. So Dullah's problem was, the minister of justice's problem was, he
                    said that if these four attorneys general refused to prosecute a particular
                    person, hypothetically let's say a person who was involved in the apartheid
                    regime, and then Dullah if he wanted that person prosecuted had to over rule and
                    interfere. Then they accused the minister of interfering in the autonomy of the
                    judiciary.</p>
                <p>So Dullah said to Deval that is my problem. I don't want to interfere. So Deval
                    said to him, “That can be overcome. Why don't you make a political appointee and
                    appoint a super attorney general which can overrule these four attorneys general
                    and you as minister won't have to interfere.” That is how the national
                    prosecuting authority came into power. Dullah asked Deval will you help us with
                    the legislation? Deval said it is dependent on Frank's organization. I went in
                    and through my Cape Town office and Pretoria requested that we bring out Deval
                    Patrick to help the minister of justice with this legislation for the super
                    attorney general now called the national prosecuting authority. Then I did a
                    program for....</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an administrative change in the ministry or was
                        it a judicial change, the creation of this post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No it was the minister of justice asking or drafting legislation to be
                    tabled in Parliament that we now create an office for the national prosecutor.
                    He saw it as a way of taking the carte blanche powers away from the attorneys
                    general You don't even hear about them now. It is just the national prosecuting
                    authority. So then we went in and requested through Cape Town USIS and Pretoria
                    and it was arranged that Duvall was coming out. In the interim I was called by
                    Barney Pityana who was at that time the chairperson of the Human Rights
                    Commission .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Barney Pityana stepped in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And then Barney Pityana must have heard from Dullah so he called me and
                    asked if they could also meet with the human rights commission to look at
                    drafting anti discrimination legislation. Which he agreed to. So he came out for
                    two or three weeks to work with the minister of justice, to also work with the
                    human rights commission, and I think there was another body that they worked
                    with. That was Deval Patrick's contribution to anti discrimination legislation,
                    and also the creation of the National Prosecuting Authority position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He created it or the thought of the idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: He worked it out. He actually suggested that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned ADA earlier, the Americans with Disabilities
                        Act which is also anti discrimination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That was part of his portfolio. Now I think I am not sure about this but
                    I think I took him to the South African counterpart of the South African
                    disabilities association in East London. Yeah, it was the USAID money . OK that,
                    and then what was the other thing about Deval now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK was the super attorney general; there was the anti
                        discrimination legislation, Barney Pityana, Human rights commission,
                        disability legislation, and there may have been other things. OK and
                        continuing Deval Patrick worked on another area in addition to anti
                        discrimination legislation. He also drafted his version of what he thought
                        should be an affirmative action plan. Now what came of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, I don't know much about the actually. Maybe that program was run
                    nationally, so I was not that much involved in it, but I think it is interesting
                    when Dan mentioned it to me that now with Terror Lekota the former minister of
                    defense breaking away from the ANC and forming a new organization, COPE,
                    Congress of the People, which has becoming the significant opposition to the
                    ANC. The ANC will still win the election but they are going to lose a lot of
                    votes to COPE. One of the things, Terror Lekota is the president of this
                    organization, and he has got a deputy, Shaloa who was the premier for the
                    Gauteng area under for the ANC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Gauteng which is the new name for the old area that was
                        called Transvaal, or part of the old Transvaal, which includes Pretoria for
                        example and Johannesburg. Terror Lekota now president of COPE.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right, and what is significant about Terror Lekota he is saying, he is
                    agreeing with what Deval said in that paper or what he wrote on affirmative
                    action, suggestions on affirmative action.. Terror Lekota in actual fact is
                    agreeing with that, and he is saying that the implementation of our present
                    affirmative action program, he questions that. He says that it is not only the
                    black who has been disadvantaged; there are other minority groups that have been
                    disadvantaged, and the should have a re-look at the affirmative action program.
                    I think it is important that Duvall should know about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what was it about Deval's plan and I can remember what
                        I can remember but you will remember your side of it. What was it about
                        Deval's plan which Lekota believes has been set aside. Deval made some
                        proposals to the ANC in about 1996 or 1997 something like that. The ANC took
                        part but not all of his suggestions. Now Lekota is saying the ANC has put
                        the emphasis on the wrong side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Lekota is saying that first of all the affirmative action is too
                    black. That is the one thing he is saying. The second thing he is saying is why
                    isn't that 95% of blacks, 90-95% of blacks in public office under the ANC regime
                    is ANC. He is questioning that also. I can't remember al but this is the kind of
                    thing which, and that thing of quotas which was Deval also challenged in his
                    suggestions, so I think it is important that maybe Deval should get in touch
                    with Terra.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deval is a little busy these days, as he is governor of
                        Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And Terror is equally busy as head of his party.</p>

                <p>SASSMAN: Exactly, why don't we do it. Let's do some programming right now.</p>
                <p>You know Dan, I say I could see a program miles away. But my wife always checked
                    me. I was too busy. Because I couldn't help it. As I worked I could just see
                    programs.</p>

                        COPE?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: COPE is not going to oust the ANC, but they are setting people thinking.
                    Terror is heating this thing on the high moral ground. I mean they chose the guy
                    who was I think the president of the Methodist Church in South Africa, a clean
                    guy coming with no baggage to be president, the elected president of COPE. He is
                    also saying that if anybody messes up, does something wrong, go clear yourself
                    in the court. We are not going to protect you as COPE because you are a COPE
                    member, like the ANC is doing all the time, right. They defend these guys. Like
                    look at this Mamallia, this young ANC youth league guy saying the courts mustn't
                    do the wrong thing with the president ZUMA. Now this is not respecting...</p>

                        about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, there is a lot of that by the Zuma camp. You saw that
                    everything</p>
                <p>Like they sort of interfered. It was political interference where the chair
                    person or the head of the National Prosecuting Authority, Pikoli.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the super...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well he is the suspended director of the National Prosecuting Authority.
                    He is adamant that Zuma, the president of the ANC should be prosecuted for
                    corruption charges. Because of that they suspended him. They found trumped up
                    charges against him and suspended him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The party, the ANC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wait. How can a party displace the head of a judicial
                        system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Wait, let me explain to you. At the time this came up, the acting
                    president of the ANC was Motlanthe. Then he became president. According to him
                    which Pikoli the NPA challenges, he says he has got the right to sack him.
                    Pikoli says he doesn't have that right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Motlanthe did this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Motlanthe suspended. And he is saying to Motlanthe before you sack me,
                    postpone the appointment of the new NPA director. Give me a chance to prove my
                    innocence. Because what happened the process was that Parliament appointed a
                    commission of inquiry into the suspension of the National Prosecuting
                    Authority's director, Pikoli. So Frene Ginwala, I think you remember, she was
                    the speaker of parliament. Frennie was the chair of that commission, and she
                    recommended that she didn't see this man doing anything wrong, and his job
                    should be given back. So then Motlanthe overruled them. I believe that as
                    president he has the right to overrule the verdict of a commission of inquiry
                    appointed by parliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he did so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: He did that. So now he is on the verge of Pikoli being sacked and he is
                    going to appoint a new director. Now if he appoints the new director it is going
                    to be a Zuma man. What if he drops the charges. Can you imagine what the western
                    world is going to say. Because there are about 17-20 charges of corruption
                    against Zuma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And rape. I don't know if that had been settled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well the rape thing he was acquitted on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what you are saying really is that Motlanthe is a Zuma
                        person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, his deputy. You see Zuma chose him because Zuma is not an
                    intellectual. He is the brains. That is why Zuma is very shrewd. He gave
                    Motlanthe the care taker position so he can have time to focus on his corruption
                    charges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the new head of the ANC after the tumultuous
                        meetings of a year ago. And then he appointed Motlanthe president.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, he appointed him as president of the country because he wanted
                    time to get his corruption charges sorted out. Also if Motlanthe is president,
                    care taker president now, it is obvious Zuma will become the president for the
                    full election term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, now this is all possible because Mbeki resigned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They kicked him out; he didn't resign. They forced the issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean they kicked him out as head of the party. Did he
                        not resign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, they kicked him out as head of the country. He was president of the
                    country and they kicked him out. I am talking about Mbeki now. The kicked him
                    out. They recalled him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A vote of no confidence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and because you see he went on with something do to with justice
                    also ruled, but they kicked him out as president of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, leaving a vacuum which was filled with the
                        Zuma-Motlanthe group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, so now Motlanthe is now the president but only for eight months
                    because there is an election. April 22 is the election. So then his term
                    expires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But meanwhile Zuma has been able to get Motlanthe to
                        suspend a judge who was going after Zuma.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, to suspend the director of the National Prosecuting Authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, not a judge, the prosecutor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: He was the director of the NPA, National Prosecuting Authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get back to your USIS programs and maybe Deval
                        Patrick. You are saying that COPE, this new...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. COPE was the new party that is going to fight in the elections the
                    upcoming elections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said to repeat the importance of Deval Patrick's
                        legacy in the COPE program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, when Deval Patrick was asked to suggest legislation referring to
                    affirmative action he made suggestions on that. He was not happy with the way it
                    was implemented what they finally came up with, what the ANC and the government
                    finally came up with. Now at the moment Terra McColter the former minister of
                    defense who is now the deputy head of COPE is also not happy with the
                    implementation of the affirmative action program policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK now I take it that he has reached this conclusion
                        independently on his own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, the program is in operation now for how many years, plus minus ten
                    years. He is saying no he is not happy because the black is not the only
                    minority group or disadvantaged group in this country. There are other
                    minorities who are also disadvantaged and should be part of the affirmative
                    action program. He includes the white Afrikaner who is also a minority. I was
                    quite impressed and seeing he and Deval Patrick as maybe seeing eye to eye. They
                    are both in opposition to the current policy as implanted on affirmative action.
                    And Mbeki saying maybe they should get together. Because Terror is saying very
                    interesting things. He says freedom songs. Why do we only have Nkosa freedom
                    songs. The diversity of our societal structure must be reflected in our freedom
                    songs. This should be a free country. We have 11 official languages. This is why
                    the White Afrikaners are liking Terror.</p>
                <p>You see the ANC every time something as the COPE does something the ANC
                    challenges or they have got to find a way to try to stop it. Now if COPE is not
                    a threat to them why are they going this route? Terror is saying things which
                    people who are not black-black want to hear. And now he has got Boesak, ok, Alan
                    Boesak his name was tarnished by the fraud charges again. What happened with
                    Boesak, Boesak was head of the Institute for Social Justice right. Boesak got a
                    lot of money from the Danes, the Scandinavians, to fight political trials of
                    activists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in the Struggle period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: In the Struggle period. Now when he did that, that was the time when the
                    South African government wanted to pause the foreign funding bulb. It was most
                    of the money for that kind of activities came from outside the country. And the
                    government wanted to control this by saying money should come through them. Now
                    I was with an organization at that time the Weinberg Crisis. We couldn't have a
                    banking account because we also helped with political trials, and the money came
                    and you couldn't put it in the bank. When I took the chair then I got scared of
                    this. I would say how do you vindicate yourself when it comes to accounting?
                    Because you haven't got a bank account to put the money in the bank because you
                    don't want the government. Now I know what we did and what Alan must have done
                    is if he gives money for the trial of Dan Whitman who is a political
                    activist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guilty!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, he gives the money and what happens he puts down he bought curtains
                    for the offices. You understand. That will pass with the government. But he
                    can't say 25,000 went for the defense of Dan Whitman a political activist who
                    was accused. So that is what they called struggle bookkeeping.</p>
                <p>I got scared when I was chair because we kept the money for our organization in
                    the safe of one of the executive members of Weinberg Crisis who was the owner of
                    the Laxerama Cinemas in Weinberg. So there was no, the money was just put in it.
                    It just disappeared. Now you get worried you know, do you want to be involved in
                    that. So that was the kind of thing Alan. I am not saying the guy is as pure as
                    silk you know. But I am saying you have got to take cognizance of those things
                    you know. It was a time of struggle. Then there were other problems. The other
                    problems was because the overseas funders were concerned is my money going to
                    reach the intended destination, what they did again they assigned conduits in
                    South Africa. The conduits role was, like Mavis Taylor who was in theater, she
                    was an icon in theater. They would send the money to Mavis Taylor. They would
                    send a check for 500,000. She in another correspondence they would say Mavis,
                    500,000 is coming. Or 100,000 for X organization. B must get 10,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pass-through organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right. Now some people who were conduits were playing the waiting game
                    saying the check is in the post. If they get that money they couldn't put it
                    into a bank account because it is a check for 500,000, but it has got to go to
                    eight or ten organizations. Now if they leave that 500,000 in the bank for three
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get interest.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: It is a lot of money. What happens to the interest. It is all question
                    marks. Then you find every time you say I am still waiting for the check. Then
                    when you finally pay out the 500,000 what happens to the interest?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You keep it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: You know I am just saying that is not an easy cut and dry thing. Now
                    Alan also did something that I wouldn't see as fraud, but in economic circles it
                    is seen as fraud. I am a donor, and I give you half a million to buy tapes for
                    voting education. Now if you want to do something else with that money you owe
                    it to me as a donor to come to me and say Frank, I had a re-think. I think it is
                    better of we buy a couple of video cameras and we make tapes. The money will go
                    much further, and I set up a little studio, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is called reprogramming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right. Now without consulting the donor it can be seen as fraud by
                    people. Now Alan did that with voting education. Apparently it was something his
                    wife was running the studio. In other words he still used the money for that but
                    it was not as originally. So that is the kind of thing. So I say the thing with
                    Alan, and he served his time. He was pardoned. I take that with a pinch of salt.
                    So now Alan spoke at the Ashley Creel Lecture at the University of the Western
                    Cape. This was the other Allen who is actually to the left of the ANC now. And
                    there Alan made his come back. He criticized and tore the ANC to pieces. And
                    COPE included him as their main candidate for the premiership in the Western
                    Cape. Every province had a premier. Alan is a damn good orator. He can sway an
                    audience. That scares the hell out of, who is the ANC going to put up against
                    Alan Boesak in the Western Cape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK so Boesak went through this difficult period. You say
                        he was judged and went to jail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Went to jail. He finished the sentence and then he got a pardon from the
                    ministry of justice or whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He got a pardon retroactively.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, cleared his name. They took the charge away. He is out to make a
                    point with the ANC because he feels the ANC deserted him when he needed them. So
                    this is a strong point in COPE's favor. You see the ANC has never won the
                    Western Cape in an election They have never because the first election as I told
                    you the government scared the colored with the communists.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it that the old government did to convince cape
                        coloreds to vote against the ANC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The surprise of the first democratic election in the country with regard
                    to the results of the election in the Western Cape was that the majority of the
                    colored, the colored is in the majority in the ethnic group in the Western Cape
                    voted for the oppressor, the former oppressor the Nationalist Party. I tried to
                    figure out what was it that brought this about. In trying to analyze this, I
                    realized that the Nationalist Party knew the colored voter, or the colored
                    person much better than anybody else. And they knew that with the so-called
                    colored the religion was crucial in their lives. The poorer the person, the
                    closer the person lives to that where his religion. When the Nationalist Party
                    studies the less proportional representation less for the ANC, they saw that the
                    first 50 members were members of the communist party or had communist leanings.
                    In their campaign speaking to the colored they said, “Do you know that the first
                    50 members of the ANC proportional list are either communist or have strong
                    communist leanings? Do you know what is going to happen to your church?” The
                    communists are not religious and church going. This I think, was the thing that
                    swung the colored voter to vote for the former oppressor. I can't think of
                    anything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you also explain the importance of these lists,
                        because it is a different system form the one we know in the U.S. the
                        proportional lists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: a proportional representation voting process, what happens is each party
                    gives a list in priority order like in the case of the national vote for the
                    national assembly. There are 400 members in the national assembly. Each party
                    will submit a list of 400 members that if they win the election then they look
                    at what percentage of the electorate voted for that particular party. If it
                    happens to be the ANC and 60% of the electorate voted for the ANC, 60% of the
                    400 members for the national assembly in parliament will be ANC members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be determined by their priority ranking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: In the priority rank</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As determined by the party, not by the voters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. The party will draw up the list and the party will do the
                    ranking.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is why the nationalist strategy of actually
                        truthfully saying that the top 50 people on the list, this would have been
                        in 1994 I believe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, will go into parliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would be the type of political ideology that would not
                        favor the church. Now building on that then, the COPE do I understand that
                        you are saying COPE can actually have a chance of ruling the Western Cape in
                        the next election because the ANC never did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, you see the ANC never won the majority vote in the provincial
                    vote. There are three votes, the local government, the provincial and the
                    national. Now when the provincial vote for the province, they never won the
                    Western Cape. That is why the smaller parties, the DA is the main opposition and
                    freedom front, all the other parties, they form an alliance. And because the ANC
                    did not get an overwhelming majority as they got in the other provinces when the
                    opposition formed an alliance they were the majority. So they were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is why COPE is such... Now we are having an election
                        in two months.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Now COPE is going to take away a lot of the ANC votes. So they won't win
                    nationally you know, but as a province the Western Cape vote is crucial because
                    the ANC wants to win the Western Cape and COPE is going to hurt them by taking a
                    lot of their votes away. If they form an alliance then COPE I think will have to
                    go in with the smaller parties to for an alliance. It depends now on whether
                    COPE is going to get more votes than the DA who is the official opposition with
                    an alliance formed with the smaller parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now getting back to Boesak. You are saying that COPE has
                        recognized in Boesak an orator, a person of star appeal. His name has been
                        cleared, and it is COPE who went after Boesak to say will you be our
                        candidate for the Western Cape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: COPE put the suggestion to him and a day or two ago he accepted that he
                    will run. He will be their candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is going to be very interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That depends now if COPE has the majority vote now. Not the majority but
                    becomes the official opposition and can form an alliance with the rest of the
                    parties. You see if COPE gets the most votes second to the ANC. No , not second
                    to the ANC,</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: If COPE got enough votes and then the formed an alliance then they have
                    more votes than the ANC, then they become the government of the day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could have Boesak as a major political leader in this
                        part of the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, he will be premier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Taking with him the ideas about affirmative action that
                        seem to coincide with speaker Deval Patrick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, look if COPE becomes the main force in the alliance then Terror is
                    going to come with his policy on affirmative action which is contrary to the
                    ANC's national policy. The other thing you know like the BEE, Black Economic
                    Empowerment. Now that is another affirmative action program where you empower
                    the black economically. Now they say you can form BEE companies, but if you form
                    a BEE company it is going to be shared and open. People own shares. The idea of
                    BEE is to empower the black person in the street to hold shares in a fairly
                    large company. Now with BEE policy what should be done, they say that 50% of the
                    shareholders in a BEE company should be the person in the street who has two,
                    five or six thousand he wants to invest in shares.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Small investors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Eighty percent of them should be small investors, the person in the
                    street.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should be. Is there any rule about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: This is the policy. Twenty percent can be the guys who can put in 41
                    million. The big guys, but only 20% so that the small share holder controls the
                    company. Now they found that it is the other way around. The Franklin Sons, the
                    ____ the big guys who have the money they hold 80% of the shares and only 20%
                    are owned by. So they are controlling the company. There is now the Chapman's
                    Peak plaza, the tall gates that is owned by a BEE company where the majority of
                    the share holders, the majority of the shares are owned by the big guys. The
                    small business person only owns, the small investor only owns 50 or 40%. So the
                    law is one thing, but the implementation or the practical side of business is
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the BEEs was this a statues or was this a, I mean is
                        it a policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: It is a policy. The whole question of empowerment. The black must be
                    empowered economically. Right, the other thing with affirmative action is the
                    policy in the work place where the person is elevated and not only working at
                    labor but the upper management should be. Affirmative action should see that it
                    is not so pale. That there is more blacks in it. So you find that this is
                    happening but it is such that the implementation has a big question mark next to
                    it. This is also something that Terra is speaking about. So there is a lot of
                    things that he is saying that is... And you know the Afrikaners in the rural
                    areas are packing COPE meetings OK. Terra is saying things that they want to
                    hear all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Lekota is saying that the ANC has turned away form the
                        original ANC principles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. He is basically talking about things that is a problem with the
                    proportional representation system First of all the people are not involved in
                    the election of the president. And that is so. You vote for a party; you don't
                    vote for an individual in both national and provincial legislatures. There is
                    not DAN Whitman candidate for ward 10. The only place that is taking place is in
                    local government elections where you have some of the candidates being elected
                    on the party system and most being elected on the ward candidacy. Now Terra is
                    challenging that. He is saying that you must vote for a candidate and not a
                    party. So in other words he is saying that the proportional representational
                    system must be constituency linked. Because what happens with proportional
                    representation you vote for a party. You don't vote for a candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this constitutional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: This is the new constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he is talking about major constitutional change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: There has got to be constitutional change because you see if you vote
                    for the party. Then who wins the members are in parliament, the list has been
                    submitted, and those 200 or 300 or 100 members. Then the party sets and the
                    party says OK, now Dan Whitman lives in Pretoria, but he can be the party for
                    Wooster. Nobody knows Dan Whitman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I may be mistaken about this but I think this is exactly
                        the system in Spain. I think it is exactly.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Now the Germans have done the constituency link with proportional
                    representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have been talking about the South African system. We
                        have gone way away from the activities of the consulate and U.S. Information
                        Agency which is great. We have an analysis of today's South Africa. I mean
                        today. We are talking about something that happened two or three days ago in
                        February, 2009. So we are looking again retrospectively at the context. We
                        still want to talk about you. Now let's a couple of directions to go. First
                        I would like to get more because I am sure there is much more about the
                        things that you did when you were working at the U.S. Information Service. I
                        also want to know about some of your activities since your retirement ten
                        years ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: OK, things that I did with USIS in my last years of employment was
                    primarily to use the exchange programs of USIS from the U.S. to South Africa, to
                    use that to share the U.S. experience with appropriate South African
                    institutions. That involved primarily working with the various parliamentary
                    portfolio committees. Of course under the new administration in parliament the
                    portfolio committees became the engine of parliament. The national assembly was
                    merely an institution where they rubber stamp issues. But the real fighting took
                    place in the portfolio committees and that is where you had consociational
                    democracy since that. Each portfolio committee was comprised of 22 members of
                    parliament from the different parties depending on the percentage vote that
                    party obtained in the election. Say for instance the ANC obtained 60%, then 60%
                    of that particular portfolio committee members would be ANC members. The DA
                    obtained 20%, then 20% of the 22 members of that portfolio committee would be
                    DA. Before that bill was being tabled, now in South African terms if you talk
                    about the bill being tabled, the bill is submitted into parliament. I think in
                    the American sense when you talk about the bill being tabled, that is put
                    somewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh I think you are talking about the analogy in the U.S.
                        would be a bill going to committee where the details are worked out and then
                        it goes to the vote. Whereas the discussion is less lengthy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, now the main where the bill goes to the portfolio committee, if it
                    is bill on justice it will go to the portfolio committee on justice, and that is
                    where the real fighting and horse trading takes place. Because it is based on
                    consensual consociational democracy, there has got to be consensus before it
                    goes to the national assembly where it is rubber stamped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the PPC, Parliamentary Portfolio
                        Committee.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, the national assembly it has got to go through the council of
                    provinces that used to be the old senate. Now that is the provincial
                    legislatures debating that particular bill. So I did a lot with those committees
                    where I would bring American participants and other specialists to work with the
                    portfolio committees and in parliament to assist in the drafting of legislation
                    for our constitution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course Parliament being in Cape Town and the
                        executive branch being in Pretoria, that is oversimplifying it but the
                        importance of Cape Town is the parliament.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: It is the only place where also all the media representatives of all the
                    media outlets internationally, you will find everybody in Cape Town at one time.
                    In no other country in South Africa has that. Because of parliament being here
                    we have all the MPs together in one spot and we have all the media
                    representatives together in one spot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More than Johannesburg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah because look Johannesburg never has more, the sort of all come down
                    to parliament. So I thin it would be more in Cape Town, they would be more
                    active in Cape Town because they monitor parliament and that is where the
                    operation is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK they talk about Johannesburg as a media hub.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That is where the business and media hub is, but I think as far as the
                    parliamentary, the parliamentary correspondents would all be in Cape Town. But
                    you will have parliamentary correspondents from Port Elizabeth, the eastern
                    province ___. They are not in Johannesburg; they are down here in Cape Town. So
                    I am saying that nationally you will have all the media representatives and
                    international will be in Cape Town at one time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now so your work was with these parliamentary portfolio
                        committees was very formative in resulting in the system as it is now in
                        2009. A lot of it was actually created in the 1990's when you were right
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Look it was that since I was the programmer with USIS Cape Town working
                    with parliament, I would all the time programming, designing programs for. I can
                    mention, as I mentioned to Dan when the parliamentary portfolio committee on
                    arts, culture and science and technology was, they were grappling with
                    legislation pertaining to intellectual property rights. They had nobody to guide
                    them. They didn't have anybody with expertise in the field Our agency in
                    Washington, USIA sent us a cable offering us an import who was a specialist in
                    intellectual property rights who did extensive work with the indigenous people
                    in the Amazon jungle and South America. I think though my director in Cape Town
                    requested that. And I contacted the chairperson of the parliamentary portfolio
                    committee on the arts, culture, science, and technology whose portfolio had been
                    to draft legislation in that field of intellectual property rights. I went to
                    consult the chairperson and he said, “Man that is gold; bring him. Bring him for
                    two weeks.” I went to Washington and they successfully recruited this person to
                    come , and for two weeks he worked with the parliamentary portfolio committee on
                    arts, culture, science, and technology, and successfully drafted the legislation
                    for intellectual property rights. So in that way it is not only these fields but
                    also many other fields like public administration. We successfully recruited a
                    specialist to come in and speak to the U.S. government's public administration
                    program. Because we recruited somebody who was both a practitioner and an
                    academic in the field h turned out to be the best contributor. They wanted him
                    back to work with the provinces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you saw a number of times somebody would come either
                        through an electronic dialogue or physically come and then the demand that
                        people, the people who needed this information implored you to bring the
                        person back...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Implored me through my office in Pretoria to bring the person back. That
                    is important. I couldn't decide to bring him back alone. But they really
                    appreciated it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Think of some other areas where you spent. You said IPR,
                        public administration I am sure there are many others, public health
                        maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, wait. Forensic nursing. I don' t know if you remember exactly, and
                    I was involved with that.</p>
                <p>Remember Deval Patrick called me and said “Frank, I have got 12 law graduates,
                    and they have done their law degree at Harvard and they want to do something for
                    South Africa. Is there anything you can do, that you can link them up with.” So
                    I said, “Deval, as you know our legislators do not have staff at that time, and
                    they don't have money to pay for the staff.” So he said, “No, they don't want to
                    be remunerated.” They will come at their cost.” So I went to the chair and the
                    deputy chair of the parliamentary portfolio committee and both of them had met
                    Deval because he met with their committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>I said to them, “Look, Deval has got twelve students that he wants to bring out
                    here to do research for legislators in South Africa.” Willie Hofmeyr was the
                    deputy chair who is now head of the asset forfeiture unit. He said bring them. I
                    said, “You must find accommodations for them.” He said, “No, problem.” They
                    bought them out the 12 graduates. These young people saw that Willie Hofmeyr and
                    then the committee was grappling with legislation to fight organized crime. So
                    they made the suggestion to Willie and said, “Look, used tax evasion as an
                    excuse because that is how we got Al Capone.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The students.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And then they went around and there they had the asset forfeiture
                    legislation where if you were found to be doing illegal things they confiscate
                    your assets and they sell them to use it to fight crime. So then when that
                    program ended Willie came to me and he said, “Frank, ask Duvall if he can get
                    more.” And they brought the second batch out. So Duvall was really, a lot of
                    people don't know this but you concur with me that he did a lot for this
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now let's talk abut some of your trips to the U.S. either
                        during or after your career. You had this rich network of Americans who come
                        here and had done things thanks to your logistics and knowledge of contacts.
                        So you benefited from this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, it is a network bar none that you have in the States. You know I
                    started a tour of Cape Town but it was a flip side of the tourist elite. What I
                    did everybody who came wanted to know about the group areas. They wanted to know
                    about the different levels of housing in the western Cape. I designed a tour
                    about an hour or hour and a half . I can move it to an hour or I can take it to
                    an hour and a half. I can then take people. The embassy would call me and it
                    became a must see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After retirement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, before retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did this on the side.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: What I did was I showed people the different group areas and the
                    inequalities within those group areas. Blacks have the worst, colored slightly
                    better, Indians better and whites the best. The tracks, the other side of the
                    tracks the colored or black area. When I finished they said, “Man now I
                    understand the group areas,” because I showed them the different levels of
                    housing, shack dweller, the municipal rented cottage, the spec housing and then
                    the elite, Bishop's Corner and those areas. I showed them the Indian areas, the
                    colored areas and the black areas. That tour became so popular that I had a call
                    from Walter Cronkite. I was still at USIS. I said, “Hello,” and my director, I
                    don't know who it was at the time was in the office with me. I said, “Yes Mr.
                    Cronkite.” He said, “Which Cronkite? The only Cronkite I know is Walter
                    Cronkite.” “This is the man,” I said. And he said, “Frank, you are beautiful.”
                    He starts talking. So he said that a congressman who I had taken on the tour
                    with a congressional delegation told him, 'If you ever get to Cape Town, get to
                    Frank Sassman. This man spoke so highly that I must get to you. Can you do the
                    tour?” “For you I will do it any time.” I took him you know, and he said,
                    “Frank, you are going to get a lot of Americans coming here, because I am going
                    to start talking about this tour that shows the draconic and heinousness of this
                    stupid policy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cronkite said this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah Cronkite said this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he here on business, on vacation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They were going to open up an office here. They were going to put a rep
                    here. Then he came to negotiate with the government. This person, the
                    congressman, told him about me, and then he said he must get to Cape Town. Then
                    I took an assistant secretary of state, I can't remember which one. He was also
                    recommended by somebody. So I took many. I took congressional delegations on
                    this. They just raved about it. So many people that my one director said, “Frank
                    you must stop doing these tours. It is taking up too much of your time.” So I
                    said, No. What was I do, when was I talked to about this? He says Talk to the
                    ambassador. I said then what if he says who told me to speak to you? “Don't tell
                    him I said so.” I said, “No can I go make decisions myself? No, you are going to
                    talk to the ambassador.” ____ So I think you just better continue. “How can I
                    tell the boss of the mission that no I don't want to do it?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words the Ambassador of course had a high
                        interest in CODELs [Congressional Delegations] and VIP visitors, and he knew
                        that you were showing these VIPs the things that they wanted to see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And you don't see that on the tours of the tourist organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the PAO looking at his time management didn't make
                        sense. But coming from the ambassador himself the priority was clear that we
                        needed Frank Sassman to show things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I said to him, “I have got to listen to the ambassador. He rules over
                    you.” You know the ambassador would come and he says, “Frank, what are you doing
                    today? Are you free at lunchtime?” I say, “Why?” He said, “For lunch.” I would
                    tap my brain you see for an incident. Now I can't tell the man no. I go to
                    lunch. Now he goes out to a ___ which is about 75 kilometers outside of town,
                    and he sits and we chat, and I get back to the office about quarter to four. Ooo
                    he's mad. “Look Frank. I am not hitting at you but this thing must stop. I
                    cannot afford the Ambassador's...” I said, “Are you going to tell him?” I always
                    put that. He said, “No, Frank, you got to.” I say, “I can't tell the man that.
                    He is the boss of the mission. You must talk to him” And that is the end of the
                    story. But they know if you know your area and you can advise them on things
                    then they come back to you every time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sorts of things did the Ambassador want to know from
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well it was like there was a time when the leader of the opposition and
                    his main deputy, this is van Zyl Slabbert who was the head of the PFP at the
                    time and Alex Boraine, you know. Alex Boraine who was number two on the Truth
                    Commission. When they resigned from parliament and they started IDASA, the
                    Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa. When van Zyl spoke to say
                    why he left parliament, he says, “The last four major pieces of legislation was
                    passed outside parliament. So the national assembly has become a rubber stamp
                    and politics is all extra parliamentary. I am leaving because I think I can be
                    more effective with an organization like IDASA than I am in parliament now. If
                    you look at IDASA it was IDASA who brought the ANC together with the South
                    African government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a secret meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: And before that the ANC was seen as murderers and terrorists. It was the
                    image the South African government was portraying, Communist you know of the ANC
                    leadership.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is a tribute to IDASA that ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. And you see they are not getting the credit for their contribution
                    to social change in this country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In fact IDASA had something to do with peace in Northern
                        Ireland I think. Now the point was oh so this is the type of information
                        that you received. You were the early warning system for the embassy. You
                        knew Slabbert; you know Boraine. Some ambassadors were smart enough to come
                        to you to get their information.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah in saying that the ambassador that happens they come and tap your
                    brain. What is the rationale behind this type of thing. Then I can tell them
                    what I told you, that these guys say IDASA is moving extra parliamentary, and
                    they feel more effective as was proven by being extra parliamentary and playing
                    the role they played with IDASA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this puts you in an awkward situation because you had
                        ambassadors, the highest level of U.S. diplomatic presence coming to you
                        directly, going around the DCM, around the political officer, around the
                        public affairs officer, and people have egos.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and sometimes it would happen where they would do it to the BPAO,
                    but sometimes like DCMs, he would just walk into my office and start talking you
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this cause any problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Then I could say with my, somebody told me twice that I must say no. But
                    I put it back in his court by saying if you tell me to tell him. I will tell you
                    no I am not telling him. NO I won't and I can't speak to the man.</p>
                <p>But not all of them like the political appointees. I never had that kind of
                    contact. But it was the career officers, Princeton Lyman, Bill Edmonson, these
                    guys and Ed Perkins.</p>
                <p>You see so there was a closer link because I know that your career officers, they
                    knew what role the FSN plays in the mission. They always use that. But the
                    political officers like I will tell you about one political officer. I am not
                    going to mention his name. I was at UCT, we had a seminar there with a congress
                    person. We were having pressmen on this junket. Then press would always come to
                    me and say, “Frank, who is that?” Then guys would come and consult me. This
                    person, I can't remember his name but in any case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: He comes to a friend of mine who is an academic that he knew, David
                    Wells, and he says to David, “Who is this guy everybody is consulting with. So
                    David said, “You don't know him? He is your senior South African.” That guy's
                    face, David said he could have dropped dead there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador did not even know who you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, and he was there a couple of months. He wasn't new. He was there a
                    couple of months, but he didn't know I was the senior USIS guy that he should be
                    consulting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So would you say that in general or all the time,
                        professional ambassadors consulted you; political ambassadors tended not
                        to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Very seldom. I would say some not at all, others very seldom, but the
                    consultation was stronger with the Princeton Lymans the Bill Edmonsons, the Ed
                    Perkins you know, who even today extend where they sometimes want me to look at
                    guest lists that they have to seat at dinners. I was on leave I remember, and I
                    came back, and at that time Jimmy Krueger was the minister of justice. The guy
                    was famous for saying, “Because death leaves me cold.” He was the minister who
                    detained Biko and in whose era he was killed. Biko is dead. Now then the
                    ambassador at that time, I think it was Bill Edmonson, he sent over the guest
                    list that I must look at it the way they have seated people. It was a dinner for
                    him. There was a community activist Ronald Roberts who was detained without
                    trial for 85 days by Jimmy Krueger the minister of justice. They had Ronald
                    sitting opposite Krueger at the dinner table. I told the ambassador this. He
                    called in the protocol person and says, “Why was this thing not sent to Frank? I
                    just heard he is back from leave and just sent it over. Can you think how Ronald
                    would have walked out the way I know him. I mean this is the man who detained
                    him for nonsense for 85 days.” That time it was 90 days for detention without
                    trial. So before bringing him to court they can keep for 90 days. Then they must
                    charge him. So things like that, that is why I found the career officers of the
                    professional ambassadors, really they knew what role the FSNs were playing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: South Africa is unique in so many ways. One of the unique
                        things is that you will always have a political ambassador to France, to the
                        UK, maybe Germany, not always. But in South Africa it can go either way.
                        This is almost 50-50. You never can tell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, as I said, there was consultation, but very limited consultation
                    with the career officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The most consultation was with the career officers. But the political
                    ones some. A fair amount, most of them minimal. That is what I experienced.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. Now some of these people who took these positions were
                        international visitors nominated by you Frank. Can you give us just a
                        sampling of who some of these people are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, the prominent ones that come to mind is Phumzile, Mlambo-Ngcuka.
                    Phumzile I met in the 80's when she was a community worker with the western
                    province council of churches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe there is a community worker in the United States
                        who is now our president. So this is a position of great importance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Great importance, yeah. So it has developed into that. She became in the
                    2000's she became the deputy president of South Africa to Thabo Mbeki. Another
                    person who comes to mind is Membathisi Mdladlana. He was the head of SADTU, that
                    stands for the South African Democratic Teacher's Union, a trade union for
                    teachers. He was nominated when he was head of SADTU. When he came back he was
                    appointed as minister of labor. But before that, President Mandela approached
                    him to sort out the drafting of the constitution for the chapter of the bill of
                    rights in our constitution. He is still today the minister of labor. Another
                    person that comes to mind is Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. When I met her, she was
                    the deputy minister of defense in the South African cabinet. I nominated her and
                    she went on a high leave. When she came back, she became the deputy minister of
                    health and subsequent to that position which she holds now is the deputy speaker
                    of parliament.</p>
                <p>The other person that comes to mind is Naledi Pandor. When I first met her in the
                    80's she was the number two in charge of the bridging program at the University
                    of Cape Town. Now they needed this bridging program because as you know in the
                    apartheid years we had seven departments of education, separate departments of
                    education, and they were not, the one was not equal to the other. Bantu
                    education which was the worse one was the one that needed bridging programs to
                    bring them to the level of the education at this white university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain this term Bantu education and the
                        connotations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Bantu education is the department that was controlling the
                    education for black Africans you know. This department was the worst of the
                    seven departments. The other thing that is significant about Bantu education it
                    was when the government started meddling with the medium of instruction of Bantu
                    education. In other words they wanted to change the medium from English to
                    Afrikaans which many of the black Africans could not speak. As a result of that
                    if you mess with somebody's language, you create big problems. It was the
                    messing with the language and medium of instruction for Black Africans for Bantu
                    education that brought about the rioting in schools and subsequently the change
                    on South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1976.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Sharpeville,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Sharpeville massacre. Which was part of that...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: That started actually the riots in schools and subsequently the
                    change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now could not speak Afrikaans or wanted not to speak
                        Afrikaans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Both, a combination of both. But predominately because of the baggage
                    attached to the Afrikaans language and the stigma they did not want to be
                    associated with the Afrikaans language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well these are remarkable examples. Any others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, I want to give another one. It was the first executive mayor of
                    Cape Town. Her name was Nomaindia Mfeketo. I met her when she was just appointed
                    as the new executive mayor of Cape Town, nominated her to go to the United
                    States, and very fortuitously while she was on the IV program there was an
                    international convention of mayors from all over the world. She was fortunate.
                    She said she thought she was dreaming that she was able to attend that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The one in California?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, I think it was in California.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it wasn't just American examples she got. It was
                        examples from many countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: All over the world, yeah. She could interact with them. So those are the
                    prominent ones I can recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And many dozens of others. This gives a sense. Now when
                        you say you met them, tell us a bit what was the type of connection you had?
                        You made yesterday the distinction between friend and contact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well you know, we as programmers we would always be accompanying our
                    American counterparts, going out to programs in the townships, in the community.
                    It would be a matter of meeting them out in their environment where they are
                    operating or it can be where we invite them to programs we set up at the
                    American center. They would then come and in that way it would be a new contact
                    and we would meet. And by interacting with them, that is the way we get to know
                    this person and identify their leadership qualities and then nominate them for
                    the U.S. government ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the difference in the quality of this
                        contact between an FSN and an American officer with this type of
                        contact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well the FSN would always in eight out of ten cases know this person,
                    might also even be a friend not just a professional contact. Whereas the
                    American would be dependent on the FSN introducing him or her to this particular
                    contact. We have to exercise the judgment and decision making if this is someone
                    we might groom or get to know better so that we can nominate them for the
                    exchange program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not to prompt you exactly but isn't there also a factor of
                        when you live here you know a person for many years if you are assigned here
                        for three years there is a limit to the amount of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and the other big thing is that as the FSN knew the corporate
                    memory and you provide the continuity. The other thing that I always said to
                    people in my case if I worked for 29 years for the U.S. Information Service, and
                    in that 29 years I worked maybe with say nine BPAOs. So in time if you find that
                    I have the expertise of nine individuals, and when I am working with the BPAO,
                    he has only his own expertise. So you have got to do a very light shuffle you
                    know when you sort of play this game. Some American officers would capitalize on
                    that saying you move, I decide on policy. You can do the work. Others would try
                    and be above you and they could never do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: different styles. You have seen them all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: So you have a composite expertise which is what some BPAOs value and
                    others would have a problem with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well when you say they have a problem do they feel
                        threatened because you knew the terrain better than they did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. Look you always se them as the number one person, and you respect
                    them as your supervisor, but some are uncomfortable with that situation,
                    especially when you have all the service and all the expertise. But others would
                    capitalize on that and use that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now yesterday, Frank,, we were talking about your
                        strategy. Your daily survival tactics when apartheid was still the system.
                        How you went about the country. Officially it did not have access because in
                        your documents you were not white. So tell us about your survival
                        tactics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Survival strategies, yeah. That was very important because maybe I
                    should first start off by saying the most heinous and draconian apartheid
                    legislation, piece of legislation was the group areas act. That called for every
                    sphere of South African life must be, ethnic groups must be separated. Now if
                    you think for instance we get a lot of American participants coming here, and we
                    have to get hotel accommodations for them So we can start there. People of
                    different ethnic groups couldn't stay in the same hotel. Most hotels were for
                    whites only. There were very I would say not so good hotels that were for people
                    who were not white.</p>
                <p>But now I had a strategy where if I book the hotel, I just do a booking for
                    Sassman and the American participants. But when we actually go and take up the
                    accommodation, I have to be very subtle. If I say to the person behind the
                    counter, “Can I stay at this hotel?” They by law have to tell me, “No, this
                    hotel is for whites only.” I will have a problem. So my strategy was I would
                    just go up to the counter, the reception desk and say, “You have a booking for
                    Whitman and Sassman.” Now it is more difficult because I pass the onus to the
                    person behind the desk to now tell me you are not allowed to stay here. Many of
                    the hotel managers, their stance on this was I am a businessman. I am not a
                    politician to interpret laws. So if I just say you have a reservation for
                    Sassman, I would get in. And in 29 years where I would have to move around with
                    say white American participants. I was never put out of a hotel or refused
                    admission to stay at a hotel, where others have had this happen to them. .You
                    know you make the mistake of going up and saying Am I allowed to stay there.
                    That is one thing. The other thing that was also a strategy was if you go, if a
                    person who is not a black African goes into an African township, under the
                    apartheid legislation, you needed a permit.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does this imply that white South Africans had a touch of
                        indifference to the group areas act? What is your sense. Interpret if you
                        can what was the prevailing sense. Did Whites just look the other way and
                        hope to ignore the whole situation or did they believe In the law, or did
                        they actually find the law an annoyance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I think the law gave them privileges that they wouldn't normally have,
                    so they benefited from this because when the change came we found it strange
                    that there was no white that supported apartheid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ha, ha, ha. They all disappeared.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They would say Oh I never. But they took advantage. If you take
                    something like job reservation. Under apartheid we also had job reservation.
                    Take for example a situation with the public transport. 60% of the bus drivers
                    had to be white. Only 40% can be people of color. So say for instance now and
                    the situation was always the 40% would be fully filled for colored, African or
                    Indian drivers, but the 60% was never filled. So you had a situation that maybe
                    20% of the 60% there were vacancies. But you could not employ a black African or
                    colored or Indian to drive in a vacancy that is reserved for the white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was this discrepancy I think because there were
                        fewer whites. What is it 20% or 15%?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah in the Western Cape I would say about 20-30% was white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the potential labor pool of the non whites was much
                        greater, but the greater share of positions was reserved for the minority
                        whites.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah definitely. And it wasn't easy you know. Then you had another thing
                    that a lot of people who were not classified as white would try and jump the
                    color the color line to get themselves reclassified for economic reasons, to get
                    a jump. Like in the printing trade most of the jobs were reserved for whites.
                    But a lot of fair skinned coloreds would go and move away from their relatives
                    and live in a poor white area where it is easier for them to be reclassified. We
                    call it jumping the color line. They would only visit their relatives late at
                    night so that people who know them do not know their relatives are colored,
                    African or Indian. So these were the kinds of things that were going, but I just
                    felt that my strategy was successful within the situation because I was never,
                    it was never that I could not do my job because of my color. I had to use
                    survival strategies to keep going.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>You see now there under the influx control laws, Group Areas Act and all that,
                    anybody who is not white who wanted to, no. Anybody who was not black African
                    and wanted to go into a black township needed a permit. Now this went against
                    the principles of many people, especially American visitors. Now why do I need a
                    permit, and if I apply for a permit it means I accept the principle of
                    apartheid. So we have to be very subtle and I would like to tell you about a
                    particular incident. Myself and one of my deputy directors, as we call them
                    ABPAO, and a black African lawyer from the eastern cape. We were shown, there
                    was a funeral, and there was a massacre of the mourners where the police just
                    opened up and shot them. Boy Majodina, I don't think the name anybody who was a
                    black African advocate said he wanted to go and show us. He wanted to show us
                    where this massacre took place. So obviously we had to apply. The embassy didn't
                    have applied for permits so 50 of us went. At that time the security police
                    whenever we as embassy officials visited the area, I don't know how they know
                    but there would always be a little Volkswagen following us to make sure, and
                    look after us to make sure we do the right things. And as we enter the township
                    the Volkswagen came and they stopped us. The policeman came out and said, “You
                    are now in a black African township which is Kwanobuhle.” So this was a black
                    African township and we needed a permit to be there. He then said to us, “Can
                    you show me your permit?” So the deputy BPAO said, “We do not apply for permits
                    so we do not have a permit.” So then the policeman said, “Well we have to detain
                    you and subsequently arrest you because you re in a Black African township
                    without a permit.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No diplomatic immunity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Wait, he didn't know at that time we were diplomats. So then he spoke
                    Russell, the ABPAO, then he says, “You are not a South African.” I said, “No.”
                    so Russell said, “We are from the embassy.” Then in knew that my strategy for
                    that kind of a situation was I do not speak Afrikaans, which is one of the
                    official languages. If I speak Afrikaans then they will know I am a South
                    African and not an American. So that was the strategy I used. Also I would speak
                    English, I would never speak in a situation like that. So if he doesn't hear my
                    accent, he will assume that working for the embassy I would be an American and
                    that would give me some kind of immunity. So Russell raised the question about
                    diplomatic immunity. He said, “No.” Now he has got a problem, the policeman. He
                    goes and he gets on the phone. Now he is speaking in Afrikaans to the brigadier
                    to say, “Brigadier, we have three American diplomats here also the Black African
                    advocate,” also diplomatic status now. He doesn't need a permit because he is a
                    black African and he doesn't need a permit to be in that area. So then I
                    understood what he said, and I could then interpret and tell my American
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he say word for word?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: He said in Afrikaans, Brigadier... so what he said was in English,
                    “Brigadier, there is big shit here.” In other words he has now detained three
                    diplomats and he doesn't know hat to do now. So then the Brigadier then told me,
                    and this is what he related to us, that the brigadier says look, and Russell the
                    American officer then told him , “Look, why must we get permits in South Africa.
                    Your diplomats in the United States do not have to apply for permits. You can go
                    anywhere you want to.” He says, “Well that is America, this is South Africa.”
                    Russell said, “We do not apply for permits, so you will have to do what you deem
                    appropriate.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Approximately what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: This was 80's. So then Russell said, So we stood there now. So the
                    Brigadier said, “Well you can take these people around without a permit and let
                    them see whatever they want to see, and then make sure they get out of the black
                    township.” So Russell said, “Well we have already seen what we wanted to see, so
                    can we go now?” So he says, “Yeah you can go.” We got into our car, and that
                    Volkswagen followed us from Kwanobuhle right to Port Elizabeth airport to make
                    sure we got on the plane to go back to Cape Town. So that distance that they
                    followed us was plus minus 80 kilometers. Say about 40 miles. I also took
                    congressional delegations with the consul general to a black African squatter
                    camp where we require a permit. Now one particular incident with was also in the
                    early 80s, as we went into the squatter camp, the security police stopped us and
                    said where is our permit. So the consul general explained to him, “We cannot
                    apply for permits, so we do not have a permit but we wanted to show the
                    congressmen what is happening here. So he said, 'Well you will have to get a
                    permit.” So the consul general said, “Well I am not prepared to apply for a
                    permit.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the policy of the U.S. embassy and the U.S.
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, the U.S. government did not apply for permits. If you found under
                    South African law if you are in a squatter camp or shanty town or any township
                    for Black Africans and you do not have a permit, you can be prosecuted. They
                    have already arrested and they acquitted him again a white member of the South
                    African parliament for being in an area without a permit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prosecuted for what type of penalty?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well it is a fine and just a warning. But the law says you can be
                    arrested. They also arrested the leader of the opposition for being in
                    possession of a banned book and he was fined a certain amount of rand. So then
                    when the consul general insisted that he is going to go in. this policeman
                    became aggressive and says, “Look, if you bring these congressmen into this
                    camp, I have the right to baton and charge you.” You know you call it the baton,
                    where they have the baton the police person carries, and would beat us up you
                    know. So I said to the consul general, “No, we make as if we are leaving. I will
                    take you to the other side. There is a road or whatever and there is a hill.
                    That area is not a black area. It is a colored area. So we do not need a permit.
                    And if we go to the top of the hill we have an overview of what is happening
                    there.” Because you see what they were doing. At the moment, they were
                    demolishing the temporary structures that the squatters were putting up there.
                    It was going to rain that evening. That is what we wanted to see. So then before
                    they realized it we were on the hill on the other side. Then the policeman came,
                    it was security police, and he came to the consul general and I was standing
                    next to the consul general. He said, “Look, you have to leave.” So I said to
                    him, in Afrikaans to make him know that I am a South African because the consul
                    general is now there. So I said to him, “No, we do not need a permit here. Is
                    this a black African area?” He said, “No it is a colored area.” “Then we don't
                    need a permit.” He looked at me and he said, “You are too clever. You must watch
                    yourself.” So we could see and the congressmen walked around there. So that was
                    the kind of thing that wasn't just like in any other society where you just do
                    the job. There was a threat to your life. I remember there was also a time when
                    in parliament they discussed the activities of the USIS officers in the country.
                    They accused the USIS officers of being involved in subversive activities. You
                    know it came out in the Eastern Cape area one of the constituencies in the
                    eastern cape. He brought this to the attention of parliament. That time the
                    whole question of U.S. foreign investment versus disinvestment or divestment was
                    very prominent. We had a video tape on the program that was on the U.S. in the
                    early 80's The advocates, where they would take the topic and they would then
                    debate the topic. This was disinvestment of American companies in South Africa.
                    I remember Chester Crocker was still an academic at the time. He was not
                    assistant secretary for African affairs. He wasn't in that position yet. Alex
                    Boraine who became the number two to Desmond Tutu for the Truth and
                    Reconciliation Commission, they were and Jennifer Davis, a South African
                    economist who was living in the United States, and Dennis Brutus who was a South
                    African professor who was living in exile in the U.S. They then debated and we
                    showed this tape in East London. We showed the tape in Graves Town and We showed
                    it in Port Elizabeth. The security police followed us from East London down to
                    Port Elizabeth which was plus minus 600 kilometers, say about 300 miles. Then
                    they reported to parliament that the American embassy was there showing
                    subversive materials. So this was the kind of thing you had to counter all the
                    time. It wasn't just like in a normal society where you can just do these
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were showing this video in various places and the
                        police physically followed you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and they were in the audience also. They would come in because we
                    wouldn't know it was police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they had friends in the parliament and they went
                        straight to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well they reported to their member of parliament because they raised
                    this in parliament in other words to do something to the American embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did parliament ever do anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, they never did anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they debated the question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I got the Hansard, you know Americans are familiar with Hansard. This is
                    the publication that publishes verbatim what happens in parliament. Both he and
                    my director the BPAO at the time and myself, our names were mentioned in
                    Hansard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow, which is OK for Bob Heath because he can leave the
                        country, but you live here. You had to live with this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I can't speak for other FSNs, but for me in particular because I was
                    very active in these things with my American counterparts. They would try and
                    intimidate me. I will give you some examples. There was one incident where I had
                    a call from this person, and he claimed he was a security officer with the South
                    African navy, the Simonson dockyard is the headquarters of the South African
                    navy. Obviously he said he is a secure.</p>
                <p>I said, “Are you with the Security Police to clear that.” He said, “No I am not
                    with the Security Police. I am with security at the navy.” I said, “Why are you
                    calling me?” “You are working for the American embassy.” I said, “Yes.” He says,
                    “Your brother is working for the South African navy.” I said, “Yes.” He said,
                    “Now we are concerned that when you and your brother meet that he might be
                    telling you secrets about the South African Navy.” I said, “No, the last thing
                    we speak about is the work. We talk about family issues and all kinds of
                    things.” So he said “We want to come and visit you and find out exactly what you
                    are doing.” I said, “No, if you want to find out what I am doing, you have got
                    to come to my work place.” I do not make policy. I am not involved in embassy
                    policy, so if you are coming, and I have no problem. I have got nothing to hide.
                    Then I would like my ambassador to be present. But I don't want you at my home
                    and I don't want to meet with you anywhere else.”</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>He said, “Ok I will come back to you,” and he never came back to me. So it was
                    obvious that it was the security police trying to intimidate me. It was another
                    incident where they saw they couldn't get at me because the embassy was always
                    there for me, and the ambassador told me that anything job related and I have
                    problems with it the embassy would support me. So then they tried getting at me
                    though my youngest son. The arrested him at a demonstration when somebody that
                    we knew in the community was going to be imprisoned for ten years, and he was
                    going to jail that day, and they had a church service. He stood there with a
                    poster with the words of “We shall overcome.” The hymn that was sung in the
                    American South.</p>
                <p>Somebody called me to say that my son has been arrested. I called my lawyer who
                    subsequently in the new democracy became minister of justice, Dullah Omar. I
                    said, “Look my son has just been arrested, and please you have got to help me.”
                    He said, “OK, go out there and find the details of who is interrogating him and
                    who arrested him and then get back to me.” I went to the Weinberg Court and I
                    spoke to the person in charge. He said, “No, look. Your son isn't actually being
                    arrested. They took him because he had this offensive poster. The security
                    police is busy interrogating him. You can check with me in an hour's time. If
                    they feel that he wasn't involved in anything subversive, they will release him.
                    “ I said, “Fine.”</p>
                <p>I called Dullah again and gave him the details. After an hour and then people
                    they network and they call around if somebody has been arrested, “Say Frank, did
                    you hear your son has been arrested?” A friend of mine who is a supreme court
                    judge, we have known each other for years, he called me and said, “Listen if
                    there is anything I can do give me a call, but you must get your son out of
                    there from the clutches of those guys.” So then I went back to the court after
                    the hour and saw this person and he said to me, “What do you associate with
                    this/ Is this a subversive song or what?” I said, “Well as far as I know it was
                    a hymn that was sung in the South in America. I don't see anything wrong.” He
                    said, “You are too smart.” So I then said to him, “Now look you said when you
                    finish interrogating my son that you will release him.” He said, “No, I changed
                    my mind. Because a judge called here and Dullah Omar who is a top political
                    lawyer called here asking about your son.” I think you must be involved.” I
                    said, “But if you mean involved I am doing a job like you are doing a job. I
                    work for the American embassy, and if you guys are not happy with that, your
                    fight is with the chief of mission my ambassador. It is not with me. I just
                    carry out instructions like you carry out.”</p>
                <p>He said, No I don't want to talk to you.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>I then called Dullah again and Dullah said, “Look, we must get him out of there
                    so go to a magistrate and get him to arrange bail.” So then the banks are
                    closed, and I find I didn't have 300 rand bail. So I had to find the money. Then
                    another guy said he has got some money in his safe. We went and I said, “I will
                    get the money back to you.” So then we got him out. My son appeared, they said
                    the law under which they are arresting him which he violated is that you cannot
                    demonstrate within 500 meters of a court of law against a case. You cannot
                    demonstrate within 500 meters of a court of law. So he appeared the first time.
                    They said, “No the detective handling the case is still gathering evidence.”
                    Second time again.</p>
                <p>Third time when we appeared, I said to the lawyer that Dullah assigned to me,
                    this lawyer is today the chief legal advisor to the South African Government. I
                    said to him, “Look can we look at this act, this law what is it saying. So we
                    looked at the law and what the law actually said was that you cannot demonstrate
                    within 500 meters of a court of law against a case that is currently being
                    tried. This guy was sentenced two years ago so he was going to prison now, so it
                    has got nothing to do. So let's go see the magistrate. This law is not
                    applicable. So we sent to the magistrate.</p>
                <p>The magistrate looked at the law and said no. So why is that case, I said, “No
                    that case was tried two years ago. This man was going to prison and there was a
                    church service and he was just supporting.” So the magistrate called the
                    detective and he reprimanded him in front of my lawyer and myself saying, “Look
                    you are wasting the court's time. This law is not applicable in that particular
                    case,” And they acquitted my son. I went a long way just to show you just how
                    meticulous and how they trump up charges you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the attitude towards the law. It is called
                        Dutch Roman. Law. It is a funny paradox because the law was an instrument of
                        oppression and yet there was a tremendous respect I think for the text of
                        the law.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The laws under apartheid was intentionally very vaguely written. It was
                    not very specific. Which then allowed subjectivity to come into it, your
                    personal interpretation. In other words if the two of us looked at a particular
                    law, then your interpretation might differ because of the vagueness of the law
                    and because of the subjectivity it would depend on the political ideology of
                    that person who is interpreting. This was always the case. But if they see that
                    like in my particular case now on a technicality we said to them this doesn't
                    apply then they have no alternative but to back away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though they have all the trump cards in their hands
                        and all you had was the text of the law. They had the power, and yet the
                        argument using the text. You say the texts were written intentionally vague,
                        but in this case it was clear.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: It was clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But although they could have done anything they wanted.
                        Apparently they retreated not from you but from the way that the law was
                        written.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: They did, but the other thing. That is why a lot of black lawyers or
                    lawyers who were not white strongly argued this point saying that if you take
                    rape. Let's take rape. Now it is the same crime. The circumstances can be
                    exactly the same. But in the one case if it is a white perpetrator raping a
                    black woman, he would maybe get a fine or he would be acquitted, or he would be
                    sentenced to one or two months. You get the same situation with a black man
                    rapes a white woman, at that time we had the death penalty. He could be
                    sentenced to death. He could get imprisonment of five or ten years. So those
                    would be the two. For the same crime the same circumstances, but the sentencing,
                    you see the subjectivity there, the sentence would be totally different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the sentencing was not codified and this was left up to
                        the discretion of the judge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: The judge or the magistrate. So as I say it is the same circumstances,
                    same crime but look at the severity of the sentence on the one hand or on the
                    other hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The subjectivity of the judge determining our view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, then another thing that was part of my job, and sometimes the
                    political section, my director would ask us. We have a judge, we have a lawyer,
                    take them out to the pass law courts. Now this was if anybody, people would sit
                    there for about two or three minutes and then they say no I want to go. What
                    happens there, I must first explain to you the influx control law. In the case
                    of a person who is not a black African you have an identity document. The police
                    would never ask you to produce that document in the street. You would produce
                    that to prove that you are Dan Whitman. You would show the bank, the post office
                    over here. But the pass, or the don't pass as they call it. Every person who was
                    black African had to carry a pass. That pass under the influx control laws,
                    Africans were kept out of the urban areas unless you were born in an urban area.
                    Now there is flexibility within that. But Africans were not allowed to be in the
                    urban area without their pass being endorsed accordingly. So under the influx
                    control laws where it was used to keep the Africans our of the urban area. They
                    had to be in the rural area. Under that law, a person will be arrested if you
                    are found in Central Cape Town and your pass is not endorsed for you to be in
                    Cape Town.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which you are if you're a domestic worker. Is that
                        correct? How did they deal with the domestic worker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No you could be under building trade, you could work on the building
                    trade. But if say I am a white person and I have a domestic person working for
                    me. I have to go to the authorities and have her pass endorsed to say that she
                    is allowed to work for Frank Sassman in this particular area, and it is stamped
                    by the Bantu administration. Bantu at that time was the classification they used
                    with the person who was black African. So then they would then arrest that
                    person and those people would appear in the pass law courts out on the
                    townships. Like there was one in Lungar, there was one in Guguletu, and there
                    was one in Nyanga. So then that person would appear. That is where I used to
                    take to show the American visitor you know whether it is an American government
                    official, or whether it is an academic coming as an import. The congressional
                    delegations always wanted to see how the influx control laws worked. So then I
                    would take them there and we would sit there and they would have a retired
                    magistrate there. Normally an Afrikaner but an English Afrikaner. He would then,
                    and it would be one or two minute court cases. The guy would come in and get
                    into the dock. The magistrate will say to him, “I understand you were found in
                    Cape Town or you were found in Weinberg and you were there and when asked to
                    produce your pass, your pass was not endorsed for you to be in that area. So you
                    are guilty under the influx control laws so that is 200 rand or 40 days in
                    prison.” So the man obviously does not want to go to prison so he pays it. It
                    was a money making thing.</p>
                <p>Then one day I went and I had the Ambassador with me. I didn't like going there
                    because to me it was inhumane. The people I took always said to me, “Frank, I
                    know you had to bring me here to see this. But I know you don't like bringing
                    me.” I said, “No, you are right, but I mean it is my job. I want you not to
                    leave here, you must know this part of life in South Africa.” So this particular
                    day the Black Sash, I don't know if you are familiar with the black sash. These
                    started as the women of members the wives of members of parliament. They got
                    together and formed this organization. They helped the disadvantaged people like
                    if they had to appear in court the would get representation. They wore a black
                    sash. They were the wives of members of parliament from different opposition
                    parties. They would always be there to help the disadvantaged communities. So
                    Moyla Henderson, she was a friend of mine, she was president of the black sash.
                    So she said something very interesting on this occasion when I took some
                    congressmen and the ambassador. She said in front of him. She said, “You know
                    Mr. Ambassador, we are very happy when Frank comes here with foreign
                    visitors.”</p>
                <p>So the ambassador said to her, “Why are you happy, because Frank as he tells it
                    doesn't like coming here.”</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>She said, “No, magistrate knows Frank and they know that he is bringing
                    foreigners. So the morning Frank is there, everybody is acquitted.” So she said,
                    “Mr. Ambassador, we wish you could assign Frank just to be here all the time.”
                    Then my attitude changed. My attitude changed toward this and I said, “Look
                    whenever I go, I go with a smile now, because I feel I am helping my fellow
                    black South Africans to at least not be prosecuted with this silly law.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the magistrate didn't care about you. He cared about
                        the international visitors you brought.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, he knew I was associated with the embassy, and so he knew that
                    look he has got foreigners here with him and we don't want them to see how
                    stupid the system is I suppose, so then they would acquit the guys. But once I
                    am gone, then it is the same thing, 200 rand or whatever. But you know what they
                    did then? The police would take that guy who paid the 200 rand, they would take
                    him and put him on the next train to the homelands. That guy, because he knows
                    there is no work in the homelands, the next station he gets off and comes back.
                    But he takes that chance. So this was just things that we had to learn how to
                    use our status with the embassy and whatever to survive and do our job Then with
                    marches, we had marches. I marched; it was a march to free Mandela. It was a
                    symbolic march. There was no way we could get him out. He was at that time at
                    Victor Frestair. There was no way we could get him out of prison but again just
                    to demonstrate. So we went...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this within the work or outside of the work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No this was in my personal capacity because I couldn't not be part of my
                    community even though I worked for the embassy. I know they didn't look lightly
                    at this. So in any case I went. We came to the venue where the march was banned.
                    In other words the police said this was an illegal march but the ___ people were
                    there. So they changed the venue from Cliff Fontaine Road to Hewitt. We went
                    there. When we came there, there were thousands of people. The said, “Look the
                    march has been banned, but we will have this illegal march. And as we walk we
                    will get to the bridge and when we get there we will just disperse and then make
                    our demand to the police who are obviously following us.” So we marched and as
                    we marched more people came in. by the time we came to the bridge, the railway
                    bridge there were about 10,000 people in this march. There was the police
                    cordoning off. We can't go any further now. Then the Brigadier came with his
                    loud hailer and said, “Look, this is an illegal march, and we give you two
                    minutes to disperse.” Now can you imagine, two minutes to disperse 10,000
                    people? Then the religious leaders, Tutu and other guys who always led the
                    marches said, “Look, we are just going to kneel and pray, and then we will
                    disperse.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Tutu there that day?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah. He was at that particular, it was a big march. It was to free
                    Mandela, which was just symbolic. It was a lot of ministers from the different
                    congregations. As we are praying we could just feel the whips of the police
                    across the back. They beat us up. I was...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They beat 10,000 people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well they couldn't beat everybody but they came from the front. They
                    beat me; they got Monica Joyi. There was a baton. I found her lying there in the
                    gutter bleeding. So of course I couldn't find my one son who was also in the
                    march. I found him in the college which they used almost like a hospital because
                    then they used buckshot to also shoot people. They used rubber bullets. Now the
                    rubber bullet, you know the torch battery, are you familiar with it.</p>
                <p>

                <p>SASSMAN: It is the size of the big torch battery, not the small but the big.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is big. The AA battery.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Now they use that and it is like a hard rubber like a plastic. They
                    shoot that out of a gun. It will take off people's little finger. Takes out your
                    eye, and that is what they used to disperse us. I actually brought it. I have a
                    rubber bullet that I own./ But in any case so they then, OK but I must tell you
                    this to show what happens in a normal society with marchers. I was in San Diego
                    I told you when I studied at the University of California in San Diego. So then
                    there was a street there. The citizens wanted that street's name changed to
                    Martin Luther King Drive, and they were now marching, you know. Just to voice
                    the opinion or make a point about it. So then the guy was at the university with
                    me said, “Frank, are you going with?” So first I said to him, “Will it be safe?”
                    He said, “Why are you asking that, Will it be safe?' I realized I am not in
                    South Africa now, I am in America. So I explained to him. He said, “No, the
                    police are here protecting us. The police are not beating us up as in your
                    country as you explained to me.” Then I was honored to be in this march and see
                    the other side of marches in a democracy. When ours was not a democracy and it
                    was a threat to your life if you were to go into. If that rubber bullet hit you
                    at the wrong place, you can be killed. So that was an experience to me. I
                    thought I was in South Africa I said to the guy, will it be safe for me to go in
                    the march. This was I am glad to say it is not there any more. If we have
                    marches now it will be like your marches in the U.S. The police is there to
                    protect you, not to beat you up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the worst to the best, how many years, from the day
                        of this march when you were beaten. When would this have been in the
                        80's?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: The mid 80's yeah. Early 80's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So 20 years. Complete opposite. That is an important
                        historical guiding post. Now we also were talking yesterday on another
                        subject. The role of the FSN in a U.S. consulate or embassy. You used the
                        example of this great coup where you advised Ambassador Swing that Mandela
                        would be free in 48 hours. Swing very artfully converted this into a phone
                        call from President Bush Senior. You were even able to get the phone number
                        of Dullah Omar where Mandela was. Everybody got credit for this but you did
                        not. I think the expression you used yesterday was I will put you on a
                        pedestal but please make sure you drag me with you. Can you talk about the
                        role of the FSN.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Let me start by telling you the role of the FSN. When I was employed I
                    saw that I must advise the Americans that I work with about the status quo or
                    the social political situation in the country because I know my country They are
                    only here for three years and then they leave. So they can never know my country
                    like I know. So one of the things was that I had to share my expertise with my
                    American colleagues and advise them. I think sometimes they would openly ask the
                    question or sometimes I would just take it on myself to advise them. Also I
                    would never hesitate to say Look, because of what is happening because of
                    strikes or whatever, I say we cannot go into the township because I cannot
                    guarantee your safety or even my own safety and we will put ourselves at risk
                    going in. So that was one role. The other role was that we had to at all times
                    in from the, I worked through my office, my BPAO who would then get the message
                    to the ambassador unless he tells me to go direct. So I would say to them for
                    instance when I heard about the Mandela incident, that he is going to be
                    released. It is my duty to go to the Ambassador or my BPAO and say, “Look, I
                    heard that in two says time Mandela is going to be released. I just want to
                    share this with you and I think it is important that you relay this to
                    Washington through whatever channels.” So he said to me, “Frank, I think we go
                    over to the Ambassador. So we went over to the ambassador and he told me to tell
                    him. I told the ambassador and the ambassador says, “Look, this is a very
                    significant event. What I would like you to do, Frank, if you can is go back and
                    seeing you know the organizers, the upper echelons of the ANC, who is organizing
                    this whole thing. I want you to go there and confirm this first of all. And
                    secondly find out from them if it is possible if they can take Mandela to a
                    venue where they can give us a telephone number and we can then arrange for the
                    embassy side that President Bush Senior calls Mandela within hours of his
                    release and be the first international statesperson to congratulate Mandela on
                    attaining his freedom.”</p>
                <p>So I said to the Ambassador “I have to go back to UWC.” I went back to the
                    University of the Western Cape, UWC as we refer to it, and spent a lot of time
                    there trying to get to the people. They said, “Well I must come back The person
                    that I should speak to is Amorsa who is one of the senior ANC officials. He will
                    be there at about past 11:00 in the evening. I went back there, but you know how
                    it is with the activist. Time they can say it would be an hour...</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are elastic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: What do they say, African people's time, colored people's time. They
                    have all kinds of time. IN any case so then I finally got Amorsa and I spoke to
                    him. Dullah Omar was with him and I spoke to him. They said, “Look, they would
                    like to do this. They are going to put this to the hierarchy of the ANC.” Then
                    they will get back. I said, “Look, at this point this is the ambassador's
                    number. I would like to step out of this. You can go direct to the ambassador.”
                    He said, “Yeah they will do that.” The ambassador then spoke direct to them and
                    it happened. Mandela mentioned this in his book “The Long Walk to Freedom.” We
                    said that the particular paragraph referring to that he did not mention names
                    except the name of President Bush Senior. And what he said there was, “this
                    phone call meant a lot to him. The top international statesman calling him. He
                    said that it moved him. He said, “Secondly what he liked was that when he spoke
                    to President Bush Senior, President Bush told him that having been incarcerated
                    for 27 years, he has to be updated on several things..” Now President Bush, in
                    the book Mandela mentioned this, that President Bush at that time had 27 people
                    that he kept on top of things pertaining to international incidents. He said to
                    Mandela, he would add his name to that list. “That,” Mandela said, “was
                    invaluable to him especially having been incarcerated for 27 years and having
                    been out of things.” Then the other thing he mentioned in that paragraph. He
                    said what he admired about President George Bush as got to know him...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: OK, Mandela's book has comments about President Bush.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, and he said the other comment he made about President Bush he said
                    as he spoke to him, I don't know what was the duration of the phone call, but
                    during the duration he summed President Bush up as a person you could disagree
                    with, but will disagree with him in such a way and he will respect you in such a
                    way that if you leave him, you still want to shake his hand and respect him. But
                    he valued the opportunity for that call. Then I thought to myself, now look,
                    this was, when the call happened, and I heard that the call happened I thought
                    when am I going to hear from my employers about being rewarded for what I did
                    here. It was a significant thing. I had nothing. My BPAO I went to him this is
                    now, and he didn't hear anything. Now I am sure that he must have got some kind
                    of reward. Then I started bugging management saying Look I feel I should be
                    given a merit award for this. It took about three years. That BPAO was gone.
                    Others who knew me and were assigned previously, and came back again. I spoke to
                    them, and then I think in , it was in the early 90's I did get the award. And
                    the award I was given in addition to other things I achieved, I was given the
                    FSN of the year for the top foreign service national working for all the
                    embassies on the continent of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are a couple of questions here. One is the relative
                        position of let's say the social status of the FSN within the continent. The
                        other question is you are representing a foreign country within your
                        country. Surely there must be issues. Because of a possible, in fact your
                        loyalties have to be to two countries instead of one. That is really the
                        more profound question. What comments do you have about this? I won't say
                        double loyalty but it is a different degree of loyalty than a diplomat
                        has.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, that is why you have to virtually cut yourself in half because you
                    have a job and you know this job requires that you do not tarnish the mage of
                    your employer. But I am first a South African citizen, and I have got to get
                    involved with political issues within my country. But I always had to do it
                    exactly but I didn't sort of you cannot say that I am not wearing an American
                    hat at the moment. I am just wearing a South African hat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't change back and forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Exactly. The other thing is the thing was working for the top western
                    power and being employed by the U.S. government as opposed to the South African
                    government. Your status is enhanced in your community. Everybody looks up to you
                    that you are working for the American embassy and you are dong things for the
                    American embassy. Then there are people who are going to say No, why are you
                    working for the Americans and not. Now I could always counter that by saying if
                    I had to go and work for the South African diplomatic corps I would have to go
                    abroad and defend apartheid. Is that right? And then I would get out of it you
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the question was not why are you working for the
                        Americans but why them rather than your own government. It was sort of a
                        dual question.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: So it was the worst time for me to be working for the American embassy
                    was under the constructive engagement years. That was the most difficult time
                    because the Americans, and I didn't challenge it at first. I thought they tried
                    to bring about embargoes. They tried to reprimand them and shape them. That is
                    what you are doing, it is wrong. So they thought why not try and be their
                    friend. You know constructive engagement, and be supportive and say look we want
                    to help you to change the image of whatever and all that. It didn't work. For me
                    they kept on a bit too long. It was very difficult, and you know like what is
                    it, annuals and other periodicals had very strong criticisms of constructive
                    engagement, you know Sandy Ungar, Peter Yale these guys, South African and
                    Americans would combine politicians and they would write strong articles against
                    constructive engagement. Even the opposition members of parliament boycotted our
                    functions. The American day of independence, fourth of July they wouldn't come,
                    and they would send the invite back and say because the reason for not coming is
                    Constructive Engagement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now this is intriguing. Yesterday you said you had mixed
                        feelings I think personally. Yesterday you were saying this was a valuable
                        policy. This was a good try to try to fix the situation without violence.
                        Now you are saying, I think you just said it was a legitimate idea but they
                        carried it on too long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Too long. That was more the thing because it was like even when I would
                    get to friends of mine at that rally or so, some would say jokingly, others
                    would be serious and say, “Here is the American spy coming.” They never said it
                    other times, but now with constructive engagement. So it was a necessary and I
                    understood why the Americans did it They tried iron fist or the strong arm
                    approach, and now they were saying show these guys we want to be their friend
                    and help them bring about the changed. Now a lot of people misinterpreted this
                    and said no they are siding too close to these guys. Like with a one particular
                    fourth of July function you know, the American Day of Independence, they invited
                    Pete Kournoff who was South African ambassador to the United States. He was also
                    a member of parliament and a member of the cabinet. They invited him to be the
                    keynote speaker at the Fourth of July. The opposition MPs were saying are you
                    rewarding Pete Kournoff by making him honorary speaker at your fourth of July
                    which is a very significant American event, making him the keynote speaker when
                    he was the one who gave the orders to break down the shacks of squatters in a
                    squatter camp when it was in the heart of winter and these people were exposed
                    to the elements. That kind of thing you know. They would then not come to the
                    function. They would boycott it. We had some people, especially the people from
                    AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization, which was to the left of the ANC, also
                    the PNC, the Pan African Congress who was also to the left, they at times were
                    declining grants to go to America. They did not attend our functions, you know,
                    round table discussions etc. But this was exacerbated during constructive
                    engagement. People who were still our friends you know and attended also started
                    saying no, this is the end now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A couple of questions. First have you ever met Chet
                        Crocker. He has been here a number of times.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, I met him. Not sort of one on one you know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to get your impression of Chet Crocker first of
                        all, and your judgment in retrospect now of the policy of Constructive
                        Engagement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, well Chet Crocker first. I confess I found him at the time I met
                    him, he had just come out of academia and was now assistant secretary of state
                    for African affairs. I found him to be a bit on the conservative side. And a
                    person who might have even been part of the constructive engagement policy and
                    also supportive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe he created it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, that is why. I didn't know that, but I saw that he was very
                    supportive of it. Even at that particular meeting, who was it. I think it was
                    Alex Boraine or somebody who actually had an argument with him. Then the other
                    guy was also at that meeting when I met with Crocker was Peter Veil. Peter was
                    political scientist who was the head of the Institute for Southern African
                    Affairs, he was the one who did that in Foreign affairs , he and Sandy Ungar did
                    that very critical article on constructive engagement. So I wasn't impressed
                    with Chet Crocker.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Personally did you find the police repugnant at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: I found the department then, but I understood why they were going that
                    route. You see, like anybody you don't leave any stone unturned. You try
                    everything because the Americans and the other Western nations, they were
                    sincere. They wanted to help, and destroy the system of apartheid. Now as a
                    politician, I think you also feel I could have tried that and it might also have
                    succeeded. So they tried that. Even the ambassador we had at the time was a
                    political appointee, very supportive of constructive engagement. I just said to
                    myself there was no way I was going to defend constructive engagement publicly,
                    you know. But I know that in the same way as many of my American colleagues felt
                    the same way you know. Some readily accepted; others had a job to do, and they
                    did it under protest, but not visual protest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to reconcile your personal antipathy with
                        this policy with the position which at that time Constructive Engagement was
                        the policy?. And yet you were, you found some peace. You found
                        reconciliation in yourself being pulled in both directions. You said earlier
                        you had to cut yourself in half.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, definitely. As I say the big thing to me was I understood, and
                    that was in line with my philosophy. Try everything. Don't leave any stone
                    unturned. The only thing I had against it, they tried too long. They could see
                    it was wrecking the mission in South Africa. The Americans were losing friends.
                    Let's put it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even within the U.S. Now the last question that appears on
                        my agenda let's say, and this may be unexpected. This is 2009. We are
                        supposedly in a war against terror. A lot of our efforts in the diplomatic
                        world have to do with Islam. There is a large Muslim community in the Cape.
                        What is your sense of the challenges we have in the Cape in dealing with
                        this community.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Look, I find that and as I read papers and look at the global picture,
                    and I find the Muslim community in Cape Town would be much more assertive or
                    extreme than in other parts of the world Now I wouldn't see that as atypical.
                    That is typical because in South Africa you find that regionally things differ.
                    People view the Western Cape as more critical. Just to give you an example of
                    there was the Union of Black Journalists, right? It was a banned organization. A
                    lot of Muslim journalists were on that. So we would get two journalists form
                    America coming, one black and one white to come and share the U.S. model of
                    journalism with Sough Africans. The first people we would go to because they had
                    been isolated. They didn't get all the exposure that the white journalists got,
                    we would start with the Union of Black Journalists. Then I would get my
                    colleague from Pretoria or from Durban saying, “hey we have set up a good
                    program with the two journalists or the Union of Black Journalists in
                    Johannesburg or Durban. We liaise and we network on this.” But then I know my
                    job is not going to be that easy but I go. I must approach them I come there and
                    they always say we will get back to you. I know they are going to call Chris
                    Nine and the come back and say no, we don' t want anything to do with American
                    journalists. And they done cite any reason. I once asked them, and they said,
                    “No, that is not important. It is an imperialist country and we can't.” I would
                    always have that and the PAO would say But Frank, it is the same organization,
                    Durban, Jobeurgers having a good program. As a matter of fact it is on now. “ I
                    said, “Well this is South Africa and there are regional differences.. The
                    Western Cape is always to the left of everybody else.” So I fell that sometimes
                    there would be marches on the embassy here in Cape Town. You know there is this
                    mosque in the immediate vicinity. So there would be this march down, and
                    sometimes it would become a bit violent, you know. So I always say that and once
                    PAGAD started here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Explain PAGAD.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: People Against Drugs and whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah explain to the person who has never heard of
                        PAGAD.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, PAGAD is an acronym for People Against Gangsters and Drugs. OK,
                    there we are. People Against Gangsterism and Drugs. It is an organization that
                    was started in the Western Cape. At the time it was started, everybody has had
                    it with organized crime which is two of the major problems. You know their
                    houses were being burgled, your children were introduced to drug addiction and
                    so on. So when PAGAD came to the scene, the membership in PAGAD transcended
                    political affiliations, religious affiliations and political ideologies. Because
                    the common or uniting factor was the fight against gangsterism and drugs. I used
                    to go to their marches. It wasn't just Muslims. And it was big marches. We were
                    thinking of thousands of people. Two of my friends both Muslim, the one was a
                    magistrate and the other was a senior worker, official Indian in parliament and
                    now we are marching you know. We were marching towards the airport, but it was
                    some protest march against drugs and gangsters. Now this was and PAGAD was
                    operative for a couple of months. The next thing we know now the guys have this
                    long religious garb that they wear. The next thing, guys on this side of the
                    three of us now are walking. Guys on that side pull out shotguns and just start
                    firing in the air. I said, “No.” then I started having second guesses about
                    PAGAD you know. Then the other thing both of my friends, the Muslim said, “This
                    is not what I came for. I came here for the fight against drugs and against
                    gangsterism.” And then we had a long chat about it after the march, and they
                    concurred with me. We are not saying it is Islam that is bad. It is the people
                    who were participating and had hidden agendas. Then subsequently it came out
                    that there was a hidden agenda. It was to certain extend more a battle for turf
                    with the drug trades and whatever you know. Then the number of people
                    participating. There was no member ship you know. We just went to the Mosque. A
                    number of people participating in these marches, doing them. That if at that
                    time you look at 10,000, look at 5,000 people some of the marches I was in.
                    Today if PAGAD, you hardly hear of PAGAD today. But today if they have a march
                    if they are going to muster under 200 people it is a sell out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This demonstration would have been in the late 90's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: No, PAGAD came to the scene I think in the late 80's early 90's. But now
                    the organization is still there, but they don't have the clout that they had
                    when they came out first. As I say, then it was not only Muslims, it was sort of
                    inter-denominational you know. People of all denominations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said the opinions of people generally in the cape are
                        more extreme or more passionate than in the rest of the country. If the
                        numbers have dwindled, does that mean that the intensity of the activity and
                        the passions have also dwindled? I am trying to see between the two
                        pictures, one of a more extreme community and the other one a loss of
                        numbers. What is the challenge?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>SASSMAN: It dwindled more not so much with the extremities and people who would
                    be more emotional about that. It is more..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying PAGAD is less of a concern to us now than
                        it was some years ago?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say not to be obsessive about this but you say the
                        Muslim community in the Cape, let me say it in an open ended way. What
                        should I think of their attitude toward the U.S. ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Look, the attitude varies you know. Not everybody who has the strong
                    feelings of PAGAD towards non Muslims or towards Americans or whatever, because
                    you have got to like for instance these guys at times, Muslim would be killing
                    Muslim. Then it came out that it was a battle for turf for drugs or whatever.
                    That is why people said no, this is not a sincere agenda. That is more what
                    brought about the downfall, by diminishing the number of people getting involved
                    in their activities. I don't know when I have last seen a PAGAD march..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So let me generalize and ask you now what do you think are
                        the challenges in the Western Cape for American diplomacy at this time? With
                        your wisdom, your hindsight, and looking back over 40 years, you have been
                        doing this for 40 years—we need to talk about your retirement. If you were
                        advising American diplomats today in the Cape, what would be your
                        priorities? What would you advise them that they must be addressing? What
                        issues must they be addressing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: You see, on the whole, South African society over the years that I was
                    attached to, saw America as some kind of savior, I mean this was very evident
                    with the fact of your first African American president. The identification
                    especially from the Black disadvantaged community who looked still at America as
                    that savior who can do things for them, spoke volumes. I never saw so many
                    people sitting glued to their television set.</p>
                <p>The other thing you must remember that we have three or four serious problems.
                    That is housing. I don't know what order they should be in. Lack of housing,
                    crime, unemployment. Those are three major ones. They still look to America to
                    do something about it. Not even taking cognizance of the fact that America has
                    its own problems. But they are still saying that, because at one they had a talk
                    on exactly the three problems, housing, crime, and unemployment. Then they would
                    always allude to the American model. They would say the minister keeps on
                    speaking in parliament about the problem, and something must be done about the
                    problem. And then people at this meeting says but what is the problem is there.
                    We know the problem. We have identified the problem, but nobody speaks about
                    possible solutions to the problem. The one guy got up.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That goes to Hank Cohen's comment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Right. This one guy got up and he says, now look at the American system
                    in fighting crime, the visibility of the police. I was in America, look at the
                    amount of police cars I see. And that presence is definitely a deterrent this
                    guy said. Which I agree with him. I always say it myself. So but I don't know
                    when last I saw a policeman going down my street. So I say that the first thing
                    that maybe, but the point is that guy who was not a politician, was Joe Citizen,
                    came and referred to the American model. So people are aware of the many
                    parallels. Granted they are differences, but the parallels between our society,
                    and they take cognizance of the fact that the big difference is you only have
                    black and white. We have black and the grey and what all is there. That is the
                    major difference between the two societies.</p>
                <p>The other thing your black is in the minority, whereas here the black is not. But
                    they still look at America as a savior. That varies from individual to
                    individual, but generally that is a thing. So I think they looking at, you know,
                    and that is why I found that when we were looking, like we brought out the
                    specialists. This was in my last year before I retired. I through the cables
                    that offered imports. They offered an import who was a specialist on trans
                    national crime. I You know how it works. We go to organizations and we say to
                    them, “Look we have this person. Would you be interested if we can get this
                    person.” And I went to organizations. The next thing I didn't go to him yet, I
                    get a call form Peter Gastrow, who was at one time the advisor to the president
                    on security and strategic studies. It is an institute up in Rowland Street in
                    Cape Town. He called me. He said, “Frank, thank you very much for focusing on
                    this topic. This is not my area of specialization, but it is a crucial issue. I
                    am prepared to set up a seminar of top individuals and host it if you can bring
                    that guy. I know the guy and he is good.”</p>
                <p>That is where I learned, you see there are so many. We as a democracy, as a
                    fledgling democracy. We are still battling with appropriate legislation there
                    are so many loopholes. You find that the international crime syndicates have
                    taken cognizance of this. So the Colombians are here; the Russians are here; the
                    Chinese triads. Ah you name it, they are all here, and they are having a field
                    day. And they came in I mean they came and they started gangster style just
                    shooting the local gangsters. Get out; we want the turf. You see, I mean look,
                    here is Peter Gastrow. He is a specialist in this field. The U.S. Model, bring
                    it in. That is appropriate; we want it.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>So I say there are times when America does something, and probably people get
                    upset, which is a natural phenomenon. But they still look to you guys and they
                    want your model. That is the way I see it over my years. And look, if it was not
                    so, these guys would say, “Who the hell do you think the Americans are. We don't
                    want to hear.” No Peter Gastro calls me and he had the deputy minister of
                    justice there. They had the minister of safety and security Willie Hofmeyr, top
                    names. I was so impressed. He had 20 or 30 people in. And he was prepared to
                    host that. I just took the man up there and introduced him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking for a model as you called it appropriate
                        legislation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Yeah, like this guy getting up there and mentioning that definitely if
                    we get more police. Give the minister of safety and security more money to have
                    more cars and more police and whatever. It is not going to solve the problem but
                    it is going to help.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well Frank Sassman. I want to deal with as a separate
                        chapter we are going to talk later about your activities in retirement. If
                        we can treat that as a separate subject, I think we are nearing the end of
                        this discussion. Looking back over these 30-40 years of involvement, any
                        parting thoughts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: Well I find the one thing that I am always thankful to the Americans,
                    maybe I should start with that growing up in an apartheid environment. I only
                    had two jobs in my working life. I worked for 14 years as a librarian with the
                    local municipal service, and I worked for 29 years with the American government.
                    So I had 43 years at just two jobs. The one thing that I am thankful to the
                    Americans it took me out of the cocoon of being a colored and just associating
                    with coloreds. You know under apartheid I want you people to understand, under
                    apartheid because you are living in an area that is exclusive for coloreds, you
                    only socialize with coloreds. Then the harshness of the apartheid laws,
                    especially the Group Areas Act it is very difficult to go to a cinema with a
                    white guy or white woman, you cannot, because cinemas are separate. Or separate
                    at that time. I am not talking about now, I am talking about the 50's, the 60's
                    the 70's the 80's. And as a result I only had colored friends, colored family
                    and that was all You know I was in that cocoon. When I started working I worked
                    in the library for colored people, or different libraries, but for colored
                    people. I never interacted with the libraries where there was a white clientele
                    in the period I was with them. The other thing was when I came to the American
                    embassy, that opened other doors for me. Your clientele was a multi racial
                    clientele.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>The primary objective of the American policy at the time when I joined the
                    embassy in 1972 was to show South Africans and demonstrate the workability of a
                    non racial multi racial society you bring people together of all colors and the
                    roof doesn't come down. And so the first thing that was a problem for me was
                    going to the first embassy function. I will never forget that. Now you must
                    remember I was only within my colored cocoon. My work was with coloreds. There
                    were whites but we didn't actually socialize. I just knew them as colleagues,
                    but you didn't actually get close to them. Now I am in an environment where I
                    have to interact with a staff which is multi racial. The other thing was that I
                    had the clientele coming in there was white. No matter how you tried and fight
                    this, the seed was planted under apartheid that you are inferior to the white
                    man or woman. And I the first thing I learned when I went to the embassy, and I
                    think it was Bob Gosende who was very sharp and he picked it up that I was
                    having condescending conversations. I saw the white man up there or the white
                    woman. He said something to me. “Frank, I have got to know you now, and you can
                    stand up to anybody. You are nobody's, you are not inferior to anybody. So don't
                    let anybody speak down to you. Look them straight in the eye and you will
                    eliminate that condescending thing.” I mean many of you guys, you don't know it
                    but you taught me different things, and it developed me as an individual. For
                    that, because if I meet guys, fellow librarians like me in the municipality,
                    then I see how I have developed and they have remained static. They will say, I
                    am not saying the Americans are perfect, but I mean they contributed a lot and
                    it also opened doors for me.</p>
                <p>The first function I went to, I remember there was Helen Suzman, Colin Eglin they
                    were the regulars at the embassy circles you know. There I was standing just at
                    the door there. I didn't socialize. Because to me it was a new environment. This
                    was in '73. How much interaction did we have with people other, I mean like
                    black Africans it was the first time that I got that close and interacted with
                    my. It was things like this and I just stood there and everybody like Colin
                    would come and you are new what do you do? And this type of thing, and people
                    would come to me when it was my job to go to them and get to know them and talk.
                    And that is how I started.</p>
                <p>But today, I can walk up to anybody and I can talk to anybody and I can go to,
                    this I learned from the Americans also. I can go to a perfect stranger and
                    within three or four minutes we will talk as though we know each other. That I
                    learned from the airports. I used to pick up at the airports I saw the technique
                    they employed. How to get to know somebody. Like they will start talking to
                    Frank. Hi am so and so. Are you married? Yeah. What is your wife's name. Monica.
                    Have you got kids. Yeah I have three kinds. What are their names? Ben, Sonia,
                    Paul. Immediately it is what is Monica doing, not what is your wife doing. He
                    said, What is Monica doing. Then Ben is he still at school? Now you feel you
                    know this guy. But if he said is your youngest son still, these are all things
                    that I picked up and developed myself that today I am a master at communicating
                    with people, and where did I get this? I got it from my American colleagues. Not
                    so much my South African colleagues.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>So I feel that for me it was a very good thing that happened making that change
                    and going, and I must say my visits to America and those things helped me
                    tremendously to develop as a person, and today my immediate family and extended
                    family they look up to me in decisions making, problem solving, conflict
                    management. That is all things I did in my job but I could apply it in my
                    family. So for me it was, and it wasn't an easy decision. I didn't apply for the
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bob Gosende came to you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SASSMAN: He saw in the media what I was doing and he called me. He offered me a
                    job you know. I said to him No. At that time I was working for the city council,
                    one of the most progressive employers. Good salary, good pension you know,
                    medical aid. I said to him, “Bob, I have got to leave good conditions of
                    employment what can you offer me?” Immediately the man said to me, “What are you
                    earning?” At that time I was earning, this was in 1972, I think I was earning
                    about 150 rand a month, which was a good salary. He said, “Look, I will give you
                    300.” He doubled my salary. Now immediately I said to him, “Bob, look, this all
                    sounds impressive, but I never make any decisions without my wife and family,
                    without speaking to my wife, because if I make the wrong decision they are going
                    to suffer.” So he said, “OK, take two weeks frank and then you come back to me.”
                    So I spoke to my family and to my one brother-in-law who I have a great respect
                    for. He said, “No, don't look back. Go.” He said the same thing that Bob said to
                    me. He was a colored businessman who most of his clientele was white. He had to
                    be a hard businessman but he was very good in his job. People respected him. He
                    said I never let anybody speak to me in a condescending tone. Put that behind
                    you. You are going in there, get that thing out of your mind set. You go there
                    as an equal and you stand up to those people. Two people told me that, and that
                    has been my outlook. I will respect the next person but that person must respect
                    me also. So this is basically what I never answered your question, but the
                    Americans and again I am not saying they are perfect but I learned a lot of
                    things. It is a different culture. There are good things and bad things, and I
                    think it is important to take the good things. You know so it is a question of
                    composite cultures. I have got a South African, British, and American culture,
                    and I think I have done quite good in taking the strength out of each of them
                    and making myself a composite as far as culture goes, having a composite
                    culture.</p>
