                <p>SUSAN CLOUGH MCCLINTOCK WYATT</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Kristie Miller</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 19, 1991</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Kristie Miller interviewing Susan Clough Wyatt
                        (McClintock) on March 19, 1991, about her experiences as the first FLO
                        Career Counselor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: When I was a little girl, one of the main poems that I remember was about
                    “Up into my cherry tree/Who should climb but little me?” by Robert Louis
                    Stevenson. And once this little girl was in her cherry tree, she could look to
                    far-distant lands, and I always wanted to travel, that was something that I
                    always wanted to do.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, and I had this fascination to see the rest of the
                    world. So I got a scholarship to a college in California to go to and do my
                    undergraduate work. I chose that college because they had a campus in Copenhagen
                    and I wanted to make sure that I got to Europe. I certainly did that, and went
                    on to do a Bachelor's degree in political science with an interest in
                    international relations. I did a Master's degree in international relations at
                    the University of Michigan. I'm not a linguist at all. I've never learned
                    foreign languages well, but certainly from a political and cultural standpoint I
                    was very interested in foreign affairs and meeting and living with other
                    people.</p>
                <p>I had managed to travel to Pakistan on a summer work term when I was in college
                    and traveled all through Asia at that time. I saved enough from my fellowship
                    money at Michigan to take a trip all through Europe and Eastern Europe after I
                    finished my Master's program. So I had done a fair bit of traveling by the time
                    I finished graduate school, anyway, and ended up in Washington in the State
                    Department on a summer internship, working on the Japan Desk.</p>
                <p>I decided that living and working in Washington was far more exciting than
                    working on a Ph.D. program at the University of Michigan, so I found a job as a
                    research assistant in the Office of Intelligence and Research of the State
                    Department; about 1966 I guess it was. I worked there for a year as the Iraqi
                    analyst, mostly reading cables and all kinds of written material about
                    Intelligence matters that were going on in the Middle East. Then I would write
                    briefing papers about those things that I was reading. I was very dissatisfied
                    over the long haul with the future of working in a stateside assignment doing
                    Intelligence and Research analysis and knew that this was not me, that I needed
                    to be working with people and doing something else.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was still very interested in international relations, but the one thing I
                    hadn't done in college was to pick up a teaching certificate. Back then, (she
                    laughs) all women got teaching certificates, so I left the State Department and
                    did a Master's degree in teaching through Antioch and taught on an internship in
                    a public high school in Washington, DC in 1968, the year of the Martin Luther
                    King riots. This was enough to let me see that public school teaching, at least
                    in an urban setting, was not something that I wanted to do for the rest of my
                    life, but I did have teaching credentials by then. I had also met David
                    McClintock in INR, who was the Saudi Arabian analyst. We decided eventually to
                    get married and to move to Michigan, I guess in 1968, for him to work on his
                    Ph.D. program in international relations and were married there.</p>
                <p>He was a regular Foreign Service Officer, had already spent 8 years in the
                    Service. After marriage in 1968, my first assignment was in 1970 when we were
                    assigned to Sanaa, Yemen, he to be the principal officer in the Italian Embassy
                    reopening relations after they'd been terminated in 1967, and I to be the post's
                    secretary. There were just the two of us but we were to get our Consular
                    Officer, who also had other functions, as well as an Administrative Officer.
                    That was to be the post.</p>
                <p>It was very exciting, it was very glamorous for us to be going back — David had
                    already served one tour in Yemen before, so the Department wanted to send him
                    back because he knew all the people there, to reestablish this small presence
                    within the Italian Embassy. Back then we called it “gray diplomacy,” because we
                    would fly another flag, yet we were the American interest section and conducted
                    relations as if we were a full-fledged Embassy. So we lived on the compound and
                    I worked as the post's secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: I enjoyed it. I did have a child while I was there and we could get no
                    good help with small children, so we had the baby in my office or in his office
                    crawling on the floor, my office being just outside his, the charg�'s office. At
                    the Embassy I nursed her at my des(both laugh) and did all the kinds of things I
                    could — in fact, the State Department wouldn't send in temporary secretarial
                    help when I went off to have the baby. I can remember that David was typing his
                    own cables and papers and that when I returned, the typewriter was in the
                    bedroom. I was nursing two weeks after coming back from Ethiopia where I had
                    delivered my first child and typing cables in the bedroom, then running them
                    over to the Embassy.</p>
                <p>Yemen was an absolutely fascinating experience. We called it ou“peace corps
                    assignment” because it was as primitive as anything we might have come into in
                    the Peace Corps in the sense that we were constantly battling water and
                    electricity and just survival. It was a basic survival day in a post like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been really challenging with a
                        seven-month-old baby by the time you left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: It definitely was. Fortunately, I'd had a year and a half to get
                    acclimated and so we were pretty well set up by the time she was born. We
                    traveled all over and had adventures that I've kept wonderful notes and tapes
                    about. I'd like to write about all of those at some point because it was a
                    wholly unique experience that I think very atypical in the Foreign Service. In
                    most places you go into, posts are established and there's a lot of protocol and
                    entertaining and you know how things are going to be. But we had to go in and
                    create it from scratch, and that was what was exciting about it, because both my
                    husband and I were these self-starter can-do kind of people that like new
                    challenges, and we certainly found them when we got to Yemen!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the other two people ever come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: Oh yes, they came, and we had people coming and going. By the time we
                    left, I think there were about seven at post. Within six months after we left
                    they had sent out an Ambassador and established full diplomatic relations. And
                    the Peace Corps arrived — then there were 85 Americans within a year after we
                    left. So it was exciting, and being the post's secretary certainly saved my
                    sanity, gave me something to do, and I felt like I was very much a part of that
                    post because I was involved in all the — I would help write the cables, too, and
                    I was out picking up information. I just happened to have the job title of the
                    secretary but I was very much involved in that post and all the people and the
                    Yemenis that we were meeting. Of course I didn't have the Arabic but I felt very
                    much a part of the post.</p>
                <p>After Yemen we were assigned to Amman, Jordan, where my husband was chief of the
                    Political section. I had a small 10-month-old child then. In Jordan I felt more
                    detached. I felt I was much more in the role of a Foreign Service spouse because
                    I stayed at home with my child. I did get to teac— every other semester, I don't
                    quite know why, things would break down — English as a second language at the
                    University of Jordan, to science students who were seniors and had to get their
                    English in good enough shape so they could go on to graduate school in the U.S.
                    That was okay but it was very part-time and wasn't satisfying.</p>
                <p>I did all the entertaining, the bridge parties, and took art classes, and did a
                    lot to try to keep myself sane while I was in Jordan. That was a very difficult
                    post in the sense that my personal security was much more at risk there. This
                    was after 1970, “bloody September” in Jordan and we were constantly worrying.
                    The fedayeen didn't know whom to trust. David and I were arrested in Syria —
                    they accused us of being Israeli spies. That lasted for about three hours but we
                    had to go back to Damascus, I was taken away to another part of the city with my
                    daughter and strip-searched for Israeli spy papers. Of course they didn't find
                    anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>That was the time they kept our Military Attach� instead of David. They released
                    us to the Belgian Embassy and they escorted us to the border. Their holding our
                    Military Attach� resulted in Americans being kept out of Syria for a year
                    afterwards. But that happened early on in our tour. I got psychosomatic
                    illnesses, I was constantly going to a doctor. I had allergies, I had stomach
                    problems. I know it was all stress- and tension-related.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the stress of the security problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: Yes. We never entered the car without checking it for bombs — looking
                    under the tail pipe, and under the hood. In Amman we also went through the
                    Arab-Israeli war of '73 and worried about an Israeli air raid, so we lived with
                    the shutters down on the windows and had my daughter's mattress in the hallways
                    so that if there were shelling, glass wouldn't hit her. We got involved also
                    with some Palestinians. We never knew whether they were on the king's side or
                    somebody else's, which created some very scary incidents for us of not knowing
                    whom to trust among the people we were meeting and talking to. As Political
                    Officer, that was part of David's job and I met a lot of these people, and we
                    found some of these people actually fascinating. The whole trust issue was very
                    apparent there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any counseling given to anybody at post by the
                        State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: About how to deal with this kind of stress? Oh heavens no. You just took
                    it as a matter of stride. I can remember one type of situation: a man pulled up
                    beside me at Amman's third circle and was giving me the eye as though trying to
                    pick me up. Of course I thought he was a fedayeen about to kill me. He followed
                    me all the way out to the university. I memorized the license plate, reading the
                    Arabic numbers backwards in the rear view mirror, did a U-turn and got back to
                    the Embassy and reported it to our security. Of course I had to go in and
                    identify him. He was just trying to pick me up, he'd heard about this American
                    girl driving a black car. But it scared me to death.</p>
                <p>You were constantly on the alert about whom you were meeting, what was going on,
                    because that was the time the Ambassador or the Charg�, Kurt Moore, and two
                    other people were held hostage and murdered in Khartoum and we felt we were
                    sitting ducks. That was one of the reasons why we were very anxious to get back
                    to the United States, because we knew that if anything happened on Washington
                    streets it would be a random attack but we were sitting ducks there. The
                    Ambassador had his steel plated car for protection and lots of security but the
                    rest of us in the Embassy didn't. Abu Daoud was doing all sorts of things. We
                    were there when there was an attempted rocket attack on the Embassy by his
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And of course there was no training then about
                        counter-terrorist tactics until after '79.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WYATT: Right. So we really felt very insecure there, and that was one reason that
                    I was anxious to get back to the States. We came back in '74, I had my second
                    child within four months after we returned, and we ended up staying eight years
                    in Washington. When I came back I would find baby sitters, and took care of the
                    child thing — play groups and all that — for two or three years. At the same
                    time I'd become involved with the American Association of Foreign Service Women
                    because they were lobbying very strongly to get better recognition, benefits,
                    etc. for the Foreign Service family.</p>
                <p>One of their goals was to set up the Family Liaison Office in the State
                    Department. I was working on the task group within AAFSW looking at dependent
                    employment, because I knew that if I went overseas again my children would be
                    older, that I would want to be able to work at post — whatever it might be, but
                    I wanted to have some work option to express myself. One of the early things
                    that I did was to take the Foreign Service Institute course for spouses on
                    career planning which Barbara Hoganson and Stephanie Kinnehad put together for
                    the Association and eventually managed to get it taught through the Foreign
                    Service Institute.</p>
                <p>I took that course and got some ideas mostly about me, what it was that I wanted
                    to do, you know — where do I go with the rest of my life, Richard Bowles's type
                    of thing. I knew that the kinds of things I had done in the past were not
                    particularly satisfying, that I wanted to have much more of a people-oriented
                    kind of job. Obviously school teaching was out because I'd had a traumatic
                    experience teaching in the ghetto school in Washington during the Martin Luther
                    King riots, and I just decided that public school teaching was probably not what
                    I wanted to do. Again, that was another security thing. In Yemen I was not
                    particularly scared but our Consular Officer had bombs go off in his house;
                    fortunately his daughters were not in the bedroom. There was just the constant
                    insecurity for your physical survival and not knowing whom to trust. And of
                    course in public school I'd come across the same problem during my unfortunate
                    experience there.</p>
                <p>So I got very involved in the whole career-planning process — my own
                    self-assessment, my skills assessment, what could I do, what did I want to do.
                    And also at that time I was working with the AAFSW, lobbying Congress, trying to
                    get the Family Liaison Office established — it came out in the 1980 Foreign
                    Service Act about the Family Liaison Office although it was set up earlier than
                    that, having been institutionalized by the 1980 Act. But we opened the Office in
                    March 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was involved in that besides you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WYATT: Janet Lloyd was the first director and Mette Beecroft was the deputy. How
                    I had become connected with Janet: while she was at the AAFSW education and
                    counseling center which was across the street from the Department, at the
                    Foreign Service Club I think, in one of those buildings, I had gone to her for
                    one of my first informational interviews, which was part of the career-planning
                    process of figuring out what it is you want to do with your life — who's out
                    there, who's doing something that's very interesting to you — and she was the
                    counselor. I thought counseling might be something I wanted to do. So during
                    that year that we were working to set up the Office — it was under Carter and
                    Cyrus Vance that we managed to get it set up — and Leslie Dorman was very active
                    as AAFSW president. I had kept up my ties with AAFSW as I was spending a year
                    apprenticing myself at Wider Opportunities for Women (WOW) as a career counselor
                    and doing my own informational interviewing hoping that when my year's
                    apprenticeship ended I could find a job.</p>
                <p>I kept up with Janet. After about six months that the office was functioning,
                    they were ready to send a proposal to the Secretary about setting up the
                    Dependent Employment Program. This was the time Cynthia Chard had come up with
                    the Skills Bank, and we had about a thousand spouses, I guess, with names on
                    Skills Bank forms that we could house some place. So I wrote the proposal. In
                    fact, Jewell Fenzi and I put in a joint proposal. We wanted to job-share this
                    Dependent Employment Program and be the career counselor in the Family Liaison
                    Office.</p>
                <p>Well, it finally boiled down that the Department's Under Secretary for Management
                    agreed to a half time position and that I would be the person who would come in
                    and see if I could get the Skills Bank going on the inside, in the Family
                    Liaison Office. So I worked I guess it was half time for a while. Finally I got
                    a regular appointment, in December 1978. I'm trying to recall if I started at 32
                    hours a week then, or not? I think that may have come later, but anyway my hours
                    gradually increased, and I went in in '78 and had nearly four years of the most
                    exciting work I had ever done. It was really me, because I was revamping the
                    whole Career Planning Workshop at FSI and going over and doing the training
                    several times a year as spouses would come through either en route to post or
                    returning to the work force in Washington; doing individual counseling in the
                    Department as spouses would come in from overseas and work with them; I had a
                    program assistant, a Foreign Service staff individual. That's when we got this
                    functional training program going at FSI so that the spouses could go through
                    the Consular training program, and admin training.</p>
                <p>We set up the whole PIT program — Part-time Intermittent and Temporary. I guess
                    the program had always been there but we started identifying PIT jobs at post
                    and as spouse jobs. They could go in and be Consular assistants or Admin
                    assistants or whatever. Then we funneled them through training at FSI, so they
                    went and did the regular Consular Office training course, then they could work
                    in these PIT positions at post in the Visa section. That was one of the programs
                    that we did.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Another thing I was very involved in was negotiating Bilateral Work agreements
                    with foreign governments. Our directors had been doing a lot of that because I
                    think by the time I left in '82 we had on the books about 15 or 18 Reciprocal or
                    Bilateral Work agreements with different countries. I did an awful lot of
                    legwork for that.</p>
                <p>Another big project, besides all the career counseling and the Bilateral Work
                    agreements, was getting an Executive Order through — that's probably one of the
                    biggest things I did — in the early 80s, which President Reagan signed. It
                    allowed spouses who had worked in part-time, intermittent and temporary
                    positions overseas to accumulate credit. Three months here, six months there,
                    nine months somewhere else, and when they finally got three years of PIT
                    employment credit with the federal government, they would have non-competitive
                    eligibility for two years, once they got back to Washington, to go into a Civil
                    Service job. It was the same as having career conditional status to be
                    re-employed, it was something the Peace Corps volunteers had had when they
                    returned from Peace Corps service. We modeled our legislation, i.e., Executive
                    Order, after that. I did an awful lot of work with the Office of Personnel
                    Management and all kinds of lobbying groups to get that Executive Order through,
                    so that would have been another one of the major programs that was under the
                    work I was doing at the State Department.</p>
                <p>I thoroughly enjoyed that part of my work. I knew that if I went overseas again I
                    could be a PIT or a CLO, a Community Liaison Officer, and was very content with
                    what I was doing. My husband, on the other hand, decided to take early
                    retirement as soon as he turned 50. He could have gone to Rome as Science
                    Attach� — by then he had moved into OES and science and technology area — but he
                    really wanted to teach. So we left the Foreign Service in August 1982 and I had
                    to resign this wonderful job that I had and went to Rome, Georgia, instead of
                    Rome, Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about leaving Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: I did not want to leave Washington. We had a wonderful house right by the
                    Cathedral at $400 a month mortgage, which I haven't seen since, and I really
                    liked my work. I figured I could eventually move into a regular Civil Service
                    job if I stayed in Washington after I left the Family Liaison Office. But he did
                    not want to stay in Washington, he wanted to get out. Being the dutiful spouse
                    that I was I was not going to fight that, so we all went. Our children, I guess
                    they were eight and eleven by then when we left Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me interrupt again. You had said when we talked
                        earlier that you felt that David had some problems with the kind of work you
                        were doing. Do you want to talk about that a little?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WYATT: Oh, right, right. Well, this probably led eventually to our divorce.
                    (pause) I don't know how to even get into this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you were bringing work home a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: In the Family Liaison Office I was so much into my work, I didn't have
                    what we would call good boundaries in that I brought my work home, which I think
                    is a typical thing in the Foreign Office, you sort of get absorbed in and
                    consumed by it, but I don't know that it was that as much as that I was really
                    discovering who I was professionally and career wise. I had moved into the
                    counseling and training area, and even though I hadn't gone back to school to
                    get a degree in counseling, those were the kinds of things I was interested in.
                    I wasn't into reading history and art and doing a lot of the things that would
                    go along with keeping up my international relations interest. I really was much
                    more focused on helping people discover who they were and find out what they
                    wanted to do with their lives. Career counseling was really “it” for me, that
                    was just what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>He felt I was pulling away from the marriage because I had professional
                    interests. At the same time that we were in Washington, we also, as a family,
                    renovated a 25-acre farm out in Virginia which we bought for our weekend place.
                    He and I cleared three acres of land by hand and restored these old houses. We
                    were the typical “Type A Family” — both of us had full time jobs, two young
                    kids, worked nonstop all week, and then went for relaxation which was further
                    strenuous work but at least it was physical labor. And we did have some
                    wonderful times at our farm in Virginia, which we also had to leave and rent out
                    when we moved to Georgia.</p>
                <p>I think that we created the stress ourselves because we were not able to deal, I
                    think, with a lot of the emotional stress that was coming for us. And both of us
                    having grown up in dysfunctional families, this was beginning to surface. I
                    didn't know it, but I found out later that I had a low-grade depression all
                    those years that I was trying to play the superwoman, housewife, do everything
                    right and raise my kids and have this fantastic job. And it was really hard to
                    turn the job off and to compartmentalize my life and to really know how to
                    relax. I know that that was a threat. Probably my coming into my own was the
                    threat to my husband in terms of how he felt a marriage should be and what he
                    wanted for us as a family.</p>
                <p>After we moved to Georgia — we were down there for two years in this very remote
                    small town, very conservative, and leaving Washington, DC and the sophisticated
                    cultural life that we had led up here was very difficult to cope with. He was
                    happy in his teaching but I never found anything, really, for me to do. I did
                    some independent career counseling, picked up a few contracts here and there,
                    but it wasn't much of anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>So we were thrilled to be able to move to North Carolina State University two
                    years later. And then the marriage came apart in 1985 when he left. The kids and
                    I are still in Raleigh, reevaluating our lives and going in totally different
                    directions. Right now the Foreign Service seems like something that was really
                    part of my past. But I know it was an important part of my past because it
                    represented the first 20 to 25 years of my adult life in terms of the interest
                    in living overseas and being with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the work you did in the Foreign Service in
                        Washington, the career counseling and what not, have led to your current
                        work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: Oh, right. In fact I have now been a career counselor for 15 years,
                    because I did find out who I was and what I wanted to do professionally — which
                    all started with that career planning workshop at FSI; I have to certainly give
                    it credit for that. And the job that I did in Washington was what led to me
                    getting other jobs as a career counselor. I worked at the Women's Center in
                    Raleigh running a career counseling program and training the volunteers who were
                    career advisers — much along the same model as we had at Wider Opportunities for
                    Women (WOW). Then I went on to be a placement counselor at N.C. State
                    University, helping students find jobs.</p>
                <p>I also worked as a consultant with an outplacement counseling firm. And again,
                    the reason they hired me, companies now in these days of dual-career families
                    are moving couples across the country, and one person had to be the trailing
                    spouse. Glaxo, a British pharmaceutical company, is finally getting on the
                    bandwagon, that they have to do something to help the spouse find a job if
                    they're going to get a couple to relocate to the [Research] Triangle [in North
                    Carolina]. So I have been hired as the “spouse reemployment counselor.” All the
                    spouses that Glaxo brings in here come to me through this outplacement
                    counseling firm, and I help them link up in finding jobs and networking in the
                    Triangle.</p>
                <p>I must say that one of the best things the Foreign Service taught me was how to
                    network, and to know people and remember names, remember who's doing what and
                    where and when. That network is one of my primary skills that I market myself
                    with. And that's why I was chosen for this job in Raleigh, NC, because I knew
                    how to make contacts with people and uncover job leads and introduce the right
                    people to the right people so that they could make fruitful contacts between the
                    two of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>So, yes, definitely all my experience in the Foreign Service has had a profound
                    effect on who I am today, probably professionally more than personally, because
                    I do a lot of work in therapy, some group programs, and programs for
                    dysfunctional families, and through them have managed to get a lot of my own
                    emotional and personal life sorted out that I wasn't able to deal with in the
                    Foreign Service. I think part of that was the nature of the Foreign Service.
                    That nature of the diplomatic corps gets right back to the trust issue we were
                    talking about earlier, that it's almost like a game and the game is to go out
                    and you meet people and you want to find out what they're doing but you don't
                    want to tell them everything that you're doing because after all you're going to
                    go back and report on what you're getting from them.</p>
                <p>It is not the kind of career conducive to open, honest relationships. There's a
                    lot of very much surface living, very superficial, in that you do a lot of
                    things and you can keep very secret who you really are. That was something that
                    I had kept to myself for years and years. I wasn't in touch with my own
                    emotions. And I think that not knowing whom to trust in the type of situation I
                    was in the Middle East led to a lot of problems — many people spend their life
                    being afraid of becoming who they really are, because “if I do this, then this
                    might happen.” It's just too fearful. I think the Foreign Service actually
                    fosters that in a lot of people.</p>
                <p>It's fascinating, it's exciting, you meet lots of people, but I'm not sure it's
                    the kind of career you can have where you really can have those open, honest,
                    intimate relationships with people; you can only go so far in this — some of our
                    personal relationships and friendships were very open and honest but in terms of
                    the people that you deal with cross-culturally, there are the people you get to
                    know, the locals, whom we thoroughly enjoyed, and I did make some good close
                    Palestinian friends in Jordan — I haven't kept up with them — that were at a
                    level of relationship that I had with other people I'd met when I traveled
                    overseas. But that's very different, the people that you really get to know,
                    from the official exchanges that go on at the dinner parties and receptions and
                    so on. I just don't feel that the nature of the work allows you to really get to

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that the nature of the work also makes it

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WYATT: Well, I think that in the case of my husband and I, neither one of us
                    because of our own family backgrounds have ever been able to really be in touch
                    with our emotions, certainly not to talk about them — we could not communicate
                    what was really going on inside. I never got angry; in foreign service,
                    diplomats never get angry, you keep your cool. In our situation, since we never
                    talked about these feeling that would come up or negotiated or dealt with our
                    anger, if we got mad at each other we basically just “stuffed it.” There was a
                    lot of anger toward other things outside the marriage. We happened to focus on
                    raising our children and being as busy as we could be to avoid feeling. And when
                    the marriage came apart it just erupted like a volcano. There was nothing that
                    could have saved it at that point, because there had been no counseling. I
                    didn't know we needed counseling, I thought everything was fine because this was
                    the way I'd grown up; this was the way the life had been, you kept a stiff upper
                    lip, you made do, and kept on going. I know that there have been wonderful
                    counseling services, we would help people in the Family Liaison Office, go down
                    to the Medical Division and get whatever counseling they'd need.</p>
                <p>It was just the way I was raised, I didn't need it, I thought I was okay. I found
                    out that I wasn't okay, that I had a lot of issues that I needed to deal with.
                    And I must say that because of the work I've been doing on myself the past five
                    years I am a far better career counselor than I ever could have been. I would
                    hear spouses come in whose husbands had left them and they'd been in the Foreign
                    Service for 30 years and they had no marketable skills, they were approximately
                    50 years old, their children had left home. Thank God for the Foreign Service
                    Act which gave us in 1980 pension-sharing, because these women had at least a
                    little something financial to fall back on. But they were going out, retraining,
                    and taking entry-level jobs.</p>
                <p>It was a rude awakening and tremendous shock for all those women. I would hear
                    those stories. I thought I had a good marriage and it would never happen to me,
                    but it did and it happened in a very violent kind of way. It never even worked
                    out — my ex-husband passed away in 1989 but prior to that we did not have an
                    amicable divorce because I think we had just stuffed everything so long the
                    anger had been there building up. It was very difficult. So many times I kept
                    saying my prayers to AAFSW and those people that got the Foreign Service Act
                    passed. There are probably other things. I can think of one in particular that I
                    know would be helpful to ex-spouses, in addition to the kind of legislation that
                    we've already gotten.</p>
                <p>Two things that happened, actually, before my husband died and we had negotiated
                    the divorce agreement financially: children are supposed to get a death benefit
                    and that is to be divided. There can be three children, an amount, I don't
                    remember the amount exactly, perhaps $200 a month, during their minority. And
                    what my husband and I and nobody knew was that it doesn't specify that they be
                    natural children. Adopted children share in that pie. My husband remarried
                    immediately and when he died I thought I would have a certain sum of money for
                    my children, and they had to share the money with the new wife's two children.
                    They're all getting the same amount of money which is a lesser amount than what
                    I had assumed it would be.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>That's something that needs to be looked at. He never adopted those children at
                    all but that's what the law is. Social Security does the same thing and it's
                    really certainly hurt us financially, because I had counted on having that
                    additional money. That's something I have been very angry about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is anyone working on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: I don't think so. I talked to the Retirement people about it and one said,
                    “Well, that's the law.” I have written to the Family Liaison Office that that
                    legislation needs to be corrected. I mean, if I had known I could perhaps have
                    spelled it out in the divorce agreement or something, but I didn't know that, I
                    had no idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you thought that he didn't know it either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: I don't think he did. I think it was just one of those loopholes that
                    nobody could have known about. And I am getting my pro rata share and that
                    continues even after his death, which is very fortunate. The one place that I'm
                    very resentful about is that the Foreign Service still looks at this ex-spouse
                    who is pension-sharing in the same way that you would look at somebody you were
                    divorcing and it was treated as alimony instead of a pension or annuity —
                    because I am not allowed to remarry until I'm 55 or I will lose my pension. Only
                    after that age could I keep it.</p>
                <p>Here I was, divorced at 42, and if I want my pension, which I worked very hard to
                    get — I have not had any kind of career-type position where I could earn my
                    pension, again because I'm not in a pension-type program at NCSU any more — that
                    little percentage of his annuity is all that I have for my own pension, and I am
                    48 now. I don't see that I could ever earn my 20 years or whatever, it will be
                    that and Social Security and whatever assets I can hang onto that I came out of
                    the marriage with.</p>
                <p>So that needs to be corrected. I saw that some military family raised the same
                    issue. I need to get busy with Pat Schroeder [U.S. Congresswoman] and some of
                    the committees that can change that legislation, because I think that it's very
                    unfair in that it's still seeing the Foreign Service spouse as a dependent of
                    this male. They don't see it as an annuity that she earned in her own right for
                    all those hard years of service overseas, that she's going to lose it if she
                    goes out and finds another man to take care of her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's as if, then, that it isn't hers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: It's not hers. It's subsistence while you're in this single status, but it
                    should be ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the various plans that have been put forward
                        for paid work for the various kinds of representational and other work that
                        we have to do overseas? There have been a lot of suggestions ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... on how that could be legislated. Do you have some
                        thoughts on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: Well, it was something we started to work on 10 or 12 years ago. There
                    were all these ideas put forward. I don't know what the status of it is now,
                    whether they would ever give the spouse's wife — at what level, how far down did
                    you go, was it only the Ambassador's and DCM's or First Secretary's wife? Who
                    would be included in this to get pay for, say, 20 hours a week of work as a PIT;
                    they could give them a PIT assignment. Maybe they could do it as a contract.</p>
                <p>We were looking at contracts for spouses to provide a certain amount of
                    entertaining each month. I do not know where that stands right now, not having
                    talked to anyone in the Family Liaison Office about it. It's definitely one way
                    of remunerating the Foreign Service spouse. Many of them estimated that they
                    spent up to 40 hours a week in representational duties. An Ambassador's wife,
                    certainly, would be doing more than that, yet she was expected to work for
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then if she got divorced!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: She still had nothing to show for it except half of his pension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which, as you pointed out, she doesn't get if she
                        remarries at a certain age.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: Right, if she remarries before age 55. There have been a lot of results
                    and good strides made but there's still a long way to go, I think, for
                    recognition of the Foreign Service spouse and the mobility, the life style that
                    we have to lead — it really has tremendous impact not only on your career but on
                    your personal life.</p>

                        how that got going.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WYATT: I think I mentioned earlier that the American Foreign Service Women's
                    Association was the catalyst, the lobbying organization that started talking to
                    the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Management in the State Department and
                    Committees on the Hill, because they had seen that military families got
                    legislation passed that helped them in some way; at least the pension-sharing
                    had come earlier. But I think the real impetus came when the Foreign Service
                    Education and Counseling Center started, I don't know when, maybe in the early
                    70s or late 60s. Because education and Foreign Service mobility was, I think,
                    the first topic to surface, as this crazy mobile life style of ours is having an
                    impact on the children's education and their emotional stability.</p>
                <p>Again, a woman was trailing along. It was the children's educational and
                    counseling needs that got the FSECC, or whatever it was called, organized first
                    — on the outside, it was not inside the Department. They had counselors working
                    there who were Foreign Service spouses who were trained in educational testing
                    and all the problems that people have educationally as they move among school
                    systems. Of course, therapy was slowly beginning to surface as a tool back in
                    the 70s when people came out of the closet, “Yes! I need help, I'm not
                    emotionally able to handle this particular move” or whatever it was.
                    Fortunately, people began to speak up for their mental health needs too.</p>
                <p>So that's why FSECC got started, and through that group and Leslie Dorman as
                    president of AAFSW, it happened at a time when politically the Foreign System
                    was being run by Cyrus Vance and the Democratic leaders under Jimmy Carter. That
                    window of time between '76 and '80 was the only time possibly that a lobbying
                    effort came to fruition because they got support from the powers-that-be. It was
                    sort of the right place at the right time, and there was a lot of effort. As I
                    mentioned, I primarily was on the subgroup that dealt with dependent employment.
                    Other people were working on getting the main Office started, talking to all the
                    people they needed to talk to, testifying before Congress, and Leslie Dorman
                    will have that story in these very tapes about how all that got started.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>The employment picture was just one of several issues. One of the committees was
                    “the representational spouse.” “Employment,” “education,” and the whole issue of
                    the “pension-sharing and the divorced spouse”, the displaced homemaker. There
                    were four or five different categories that different groups of people were
                    working on to get this Family Liaison Office started. And “dependent employment”
                    — our little subcommittee got the Skills Bank started under Cynthia Chard. We
                    had the idea, when that was started, that if the spouses had down on paper all
                    their favorite skills, the things that they could do, then those skills could be
                    sent ahead to the Post, which could say, “Oh, there's a spouse coming whom we
                    can give a contract-writing job to” or “she's had administrative work” or “she
                    can be a secretary for us.” They would know in advance and the spouse might know
                    in advance whether there were going to be employment opportunities for her at
                    post. I think eventually they've gotten that information about the spouse's
                    employment qualities on the basic bio form of the primary spouse, the FSO; so
                    that when he's assigned a post, the post knows immediately what the arriving
                    spouse can do.</p>
                <p>That was the goal behind the Skills Bank. Another part of the 1980 Foreign
                    Service Act was to negotiate bilateral work agreements as well as to provide
                    career counseling to the Family Liaison Office; those are both spelled out in
                    the agreement. So our goal was just to figure out any way that a spouse could be
                    employed overseas, whether it was through this functional training program or
                    getting a contract job or working on the local economy. And that was only going
                    to happen in the places where we could get the bilateral or reciprocal work
                    agreements.</p>
                <p>That was the primary impetus of what my job was all about, as well as teaching
                    spouses how to transfer marketable skills — how to identify their skills and,
                    say, if I'm a writer here, I can be a writer some other place. I can carry my
                    administrative talents to another post if that happens to be my interest. The
                    transferable, marketable skills is what we kept focusing on in our career
                    planning workshops.</p>
                <p>The “tandem couple” was another issue that was addressed by this Spouse
                    Employment committee, and a number of spouses, including a spouse who was on our
                    committee, did get into the Foreign Service. They have continued to have a lot
                    of problems trying to get joint assignments, or the spouses will be at two
                    different levels. I know that some spouses had to resign their positions when
                    they married into the Foreign Service. They were allowed to reapply and come
                    back into the Foreign Service at a later date. I don't remember whether that was
                    in the early or late 70s that spouses were able to reenter the Service; that's a
                    matter for the historical record.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Tandem couples have always been a problem, and I believe you and I have cited
                    earlier that the Foreign Service is not really conducive to family life in terms
                    of how the modern American family has evolved, with women wanting to work, the
                    stresses that go into children's life — uprooting them, moving them, having them
                    change schools. There are a lot of resilient people out there but there are a
                    lot of people that fall between the cracks. It's not likely that any Foreign
                    Service family, the whole family, is going to stay intact through the entire
                    Foreign Service experience. I think that might have been easier a long time ago
                    when women's roles and children's and family roles were much more prescribed,
                    where there were far fewer divorces, but it seems like today you're better off
                    if you're single.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is too bad, because it's not very representational
                        of our life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: That's true, because we want to be able to show a good face to the world.
                    But a spouse always has to give up something. It is not, unless they have a
                    tandem job, and even then that doesn't work because they can never get an
                    assignment that's going to be in their best interest to go to the top of the
                    career ladder if that's what their goal is; that it's a way to keep the marriage
                    together and keep the people at the same post, but they're not ideally going to
                    be having the job that would be in their best interest.</p>
                <p>One thing that has come to mind, in terms of women in the Foreign Service or
                    spouses having careers in the Service, we could always find a job or something
                    to do. There would at least be some part time income, part time work to keep us
                    from going crazy at some of these remote posts. But it was never upwardly mobile
                    work, we could not move from one job to a better job at the next post. You took
                    what you could find and it was usually free-lance entry-level type of work.</p>
                <p>So over the years not only is that terribly frustrating for the spouse but it can
                    also put major strains on the marriage, particularly the professional spouse who
                    wanted to have a career all along. She did not want to be a full-time
                    representational spouse who really wanted to spend all her time entertaining and
                    cultivating the spouses and dignitaries of the country they were assigned to but
                    wanted to do something professional. So as the husband moved up the ranks and
                    had increasing access to higher levels of decision-makers within the country,
                    had a really interesting job and was a mover and shaker at his post, the spouse
                    was still doing her entry-level PIT job or her contract work or her teaching.
                    And there was really no way unless she became a Foreign Service Officer that she
                    could professionally grow in a career field. We used to say we had “portable
                    jobs,” it was not a portable career. I think that could be one of the reasons
                    why the numbers of marriages are declining in the Foreign Service — there's been
                    such a high divorce rate because those women have become more professional.
                    There just hasn't been any opportunities for them — how can there be when you're
                    moving from post to post?</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>The bilateral work agreements were a good idea, but I don't know that we have
                    seen too many successful placements where a woman could go off and be a
                    marketing rep in Germany for a company, then be transferred to Argentina and
                    pick up the same level of a job! She might have to go into something totally
                    different. We tried to pick out patterns and threads for a person, but the whole
                    goal was to get back to Washington so that then you could begin your career. And
                    spouses, once they got back here, if they were professionals, they did not want
                    to leave when that eight-year assignment ended. It was a big sacrifice: they had
                    just gotten into retirement programs, they had finally gotten a career Civil
                    Service position, or what it was that was their career aspiration; and that
                    would lead to maybe separated families. The spouse would stay back and work —
                    not that that happens frequently but it certainly explains how the modern
                    woman's professional desires came into major conflict with something like the
                    Foreign Service. It's bad enough to have the trailing spouse or what we call
                    “dual career couple” in the United States. At least you can get on a commuter
                    airplane and go see your husband on weekends if you live in New York or
                    Washington. But you can't fly halfway around the world. There's no way you can
                    maintain a marriage indefinitely that way.</p>
                <p>So increasingly there is a far greater hazard to the marriage of a dual career
                    couple living in the Foreign Service than in the U.S. And most of the people
                    like that you interview in the U.S. can't carry that on indefinitely. It'll be
                    for a couple of years until somebody can get another assignment located in the
                    same town, or they have career counseling programs where the company is willing
                    to help the spouse find employment. Corporate America is slowly getting into
                    that just like the Foreign Service has been into it for a long time — at least
                    to help somebody find a job. But it may not be professionally the next rung up
                    the ladder or what that spouse would really have wanted to do if they had
                    located in the place they came from.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd think, with all of this, that there would be
                        increased interest in making the tandem couples work, because that is really
                        the only solution.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: That would be true, except as we all know when the two people work their
                    way to the top, there are fewer and fewer opportunities at the top. And if
                    you've got everybody at mid-level, FSO-4, there's just not enough space for
                    people to keep on going to the top. In some cases the spouse has to have a less
                    illustrious career always, while the primary officer works his way to the top if
                    it is that situation; or they both choose less than desirable types of post and
                    they both plateau out at mid-level or lower senior level and never make it to
                    one of them having a really stellar position. They can reach retirement age and
                    both get their retirement and that's fine. It depends on the goals of that
                    marriage — if the career for the FSO is more important than the marriage and the
                    spouse is willing to make that sacrifice, that's fine. But if you have a
                    professional spouse who really wants to shine in his or her — mostly her — own
                    right, then it's just really difficult to do that in the Foreign Service
                    atmosphere. Unless they could be based in Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But then it's not really the Foreign Service!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WYATT: That's why they put in the eight-year rule. Too many people wanted to stay
                    in Washington because that's where all the decisions were made and I guess where
                    the real power and influence is — back in Washington. That is one problem that I
                    really see where the interest in being a professional really has created havoc
                    for the Foreign Service marriage and for the Service in general, because of the
                    lack of mobility for the Foreign Service spouse.</p>
