                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Betty Jane Jones on behalf of
                        the Association for Diplomatic Studies, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy.
                        Betty, I wonder if you could give me a little about your background, when
                        and where you grew up, and about your education and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and grew up in a suburb of
                    Milwaukee, Shorewood, went through the schools there which happened to be a very
                    good system. I graduated from Beloit College, Beloit, Wisconsin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Beloit, what courses were you in? What was the general
                        thrust of your courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I majored in government. I had started out with the intention of becoming
                    a chemist, but I became very interested in international relations, and I
                    switched my major and instead graduated in government. During my senior year, I
                    applied for a so-called internship under the National Institute of Public
                    Affairs which was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation at the time, and I won
                    the internship and came to Washington as an unpaid intern in the government. I
                    spent all but the first two and a half months while I was being security cleared
                    in the State Department as a regular full-time employee although I didn't get
                    any pay. I spent five months in what is now the Bureau of International
                    Organizations Affairs, and following internship, they were able to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JONES: That was '46, 47'. I graduated from Beloit in 1946. I also took during
                    that period a few graduate courses at American University, but I never worked
                    for a degree. The State Department saw fit to hire me on a thirty-day temporary
                    job, subsequently, a ninety-day temporary job, and then ultimately on an
                    indefinite appointment. It was during this time that they were beginning to
                    reestablish the civil service registers for appointments which had been more or
                    less discarded during the war when we needed employees and hired without that
                    system. So I began taking every exam that came along that would give me civil
                    service status in the government and I eventually was hired off the clerk
                    register. I did get an appointment out of that and I worked in what is now the
                    Bureau of International Organization Affairs. It had a different name at the
                    time. I had a clerical level job and then gradually worked up to the
                    professional level. During one of the later RIFs, I was RIFed into the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: RIF is a reduction in force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. During one of the budget cuts, I was RIFed, so-called, into
                    the International Educational Exchange Program, which was then in the State
                    Department and has since been moved to the USIA. While I was there, the Wriston
                    program was introduced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About 1954, '55ish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Right. I was at a level at which you had to take the written exam in order
                    to qualify, which I did with great trepidation since I'd been out of college for
                    some years, and I didn't really study much for it. But I squeaked through and
                    was awaiting my oral exam when they called me up one day and said: “Can you have
                    a medical and be prepared to be appointed?” So I did that, and my oral exam was
                    canceled and I was sworn into the Foreign Service in the first group of officers
                    under the Wriston program. There were two women and I think nine or ten men.
                    I've forgotten now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to go back, before you do that. When you were in
                        the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, what was the concentration
                        of interests there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>JONES: Well, it was of course in the early days of the UN, and except in the
                    Bureau, there was very little expertise in that area. I was not at a
                    professional level during those early days, but I was very interested in the
                    political side of things. I did serve on a delegation to the General Assembly in
                    the early days when they were at Lake Success and Flushing Meadow. As a
                    reporting officer, I covered the Third Committee on Social and Humanitarian
                    Affairs when Mrs. Roosevelt was our representative. That was very interesting
                    because we had these long drives back and forth to Lake Success from Manhattan
                    and I often rode in the same car with her. On one occasion, she had everybody
                    out to Hyde Park for a luncheon that was for me, particularly in my young naive
                    days, very exciting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes. What was the impression of the people who were
                        dealing with the United Nations affairs in the Department? You must have
                        been picking up...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was great hope, of course, for the future of the organization and
                    what it could do, and I think in the country also at that time. The
                    disillusionment came later. The Soviets were, of course, almost from the outset
                    making things difficult, but there was still a great deal of enthusiasm at that
                    stage. I can't recall the timing exactly, but of course there was the famous
                    Soviet walk-out...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be during the...about 1950, because they were
                        out when the Korean war came which started in June of 1950.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I remember at the time of the Korean war, that those of us in that
                    Bureau were very pleased that the UN was able to do something and that President
                    Truman did make the decision to act in that case and send troops. We obviously
                    from the beginning were a very key member of the organization and I think
                    through the years have remained an indispensable supporter of the organization
                    in our efforts to make it work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you rose to the professional level, were you still in
                        that Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, I was. But I was a junior professional officer for, oh I don't know,
                    two or three years before I moved into the International Exchange field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JONES: I was what they called the Policy Reports Officer for a while which was a
                    group which, geographic bureaus and our bureau, took the cables and other
                    information, in the morning, and summarized it into a kind of digest, which was
                    distributed to the top levels. Then we also got together later in the morning
                    and talked things over and decided what items we perhaps should send out to
                    various other posts which hadn't received the information. So that kept me in
                    touch with, you know, the main events that were of concern to the Department.
                    Then later on I was involved with the program . There was a great deal of
                    criticism of communists in the UN Secretariat and in Secretariats of other
                    international organizations, and in order to combat this, we worked out
                    agreements with various (I mean American communists) organizations including the
                    UN but also with the other specialized agencies, etc. whereby we would do a
                    security clearance on American applicants for employment, and also those who
                    were already on the rolls at the time. That was a fairly big operation at the
                    beginning because you had all the people who were already on the rolls. So there
                    was a very small staff, two or three of us who handled that in the Department.
                    That's where I was working at the time I moved. That was not the happiest sort
                    of job to have. It had a number of sort of sticky problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There were a lot of short term meetings that came up. There was a seminar,
                    for instance. They were going to invite a number of people to attend, and it was
                    decided some of those things fell under this executive order and would have to
                    be covered. Well, the security clearances sometime took too long so that they
                    couldn't be completed before the event took place. So, we had to try and figure
                    out how to deal with that and whether to exempt some of these things. Also for
                    short term contract employees and so forth and so on. Of course, there were some
                    people who just resented having to fill out lots of forms and get fingerprinted,
                    and all that kind of thing. They were working for an international organization.
                    That eventually sifted down. I don't frankly know whether it's still in
                    operation or not. It was during that period when McCarthyism was strong and
                    there was a scare about subversives, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of thing were you doing in the exchange program?
                        What were you dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>JONES: I worked initially on the college-level exchange and dealt with a few
                    countries in the Middle East, but that was kind of a paper pushing operation.
                    Then the bulk of my time. I worked on what was called the German teenager
                    program which brought German teenagers to this country to attend high school for
                    a year and live with an American family. There were several organizations which
                    the State Department contracted with to handle these. We dealt with them in
                    arranging for the students who were coming to be placed in homes and while they
                    were here, handled problems that might arise while the students were here, some
                    minor, some serious. There was a girl, I remember, who was out, I think, in
                    Seattle, Washington, somewhere in the state of Washington, who had a mental
                    breakdown and tried to commit suicide and you know, then you had to arrange for
                    her to be sent home and be accompanied by a doctor, and all that kind of thing.
                    But a lot of it was fairly routine too, but it was the beginning of a program
                    which still exists today, and which I am now doing some work with as a volunteer
                    at YFU (Youth for Understanding). It's now called the Congress Bundestag
                    Program, because it's financed by the U.S. Congress and the German Bundestag and
                    it is a two-way street, Americans going to Germany and Germans coming here. Out
                    of that relatively small program has grown this other program, and there are
                    many, many students from all over the world who come here on non-scholarship
                    bases as well, and Americans who go abroad also, and it has really grown into
                    quite an industry almost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you came into the Foreign Service in 1955 and were
                        sent right out. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, I actually was sworn in in September, 1954, and I went to Venice,
                    Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds like a crisis post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: At that time, they didn't have the extensive training that they now have
                    at FSI and I went without any consular training at all. I had taken some
                    Italian, and I had what was then called the mid-career course, but it wasn't
                    anything like the present program. So, when I got to Venice, I arrived on a
                    Friday, I guess, it was rather late, so I went over to the Consulate on Saturday
                    morning to meet the Consul. One of the local employees was on duty also,
                    Saturday morning. He came and asked me if I could do a notarial, because someone
                    had come some long distance, and needed an “acknowledgment.” Could I do an
                    acknowledgment? And I looked at him and said: “What's an acknowledgment?” So, he
                    very carefully explained what was involved which of course was nothing at all
                    complicated, just witnessing a signature. So, that was my first service for the
                    government of the United States. Well, I learned a great deal during my two
                    years and three months there, because it was a small post. In fact, it no longer
                    exists. We had three officers, a Consul and two Vice Consuls, an American
                    secretary and sort of general administrative assistant, and nine local
                    employees. I was called upon to do a little of everything and I learned a
                    tremendous amount about what goes on in a consular office.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major types of consular problems you had
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, we had lots of tourist problems, especially during the summer. Lost
                    passports, lost travelers' checks, that sort of thing. But also, there were a
                    fair number of Italo-Americans who had retired, after being in the United
                    States, had retired to Italy, and they had various and sundry services they
                    needed to have performed. Passports, citizenship services. At that time,
                    naturalized American citizens, in order to retain their citizenship had to
                    return to the United States periodically to show they hadn't abandoned the
                    United States. That no longer is the case, but at that time, the principal
                    reason that people gave for not going back, and for which they were then
                    permitted to remain, was health reasons.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right. Naturalized citizens who wanted to continue to reside abroad
                    and most of them, as I said, claimed ill health, and came in with medical
                    certificates, and so forth. We also had some complicated citizenship cases,
                    although I had many more of those later on when I was in Palermo, Sicily, of
                    Americans born abroad who had some claim to American citizenship. But it was a
                    miscellaneous assortment of consular services to American citizens.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any horrible protection and welfare cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Occasionally, but not too many. Oh, claims, you know, when you purchase
                    something abroad and it comes broken, there is a term we use—trade complaints.
                    Because of Venice being a tourist place, and there is lots of glass for sale. We
                    had quite a few of those to deal with. I never had a great deal to do with it,
                    because the Consul pretty much handled it, but Venice did have in its consular
                    district one of the political disputes, what the Italians call the “Alto Adige”
                    and the Austrians call the “South Tyrol.” We did some reporting on that
                    situation. I was also the administrative officer, so I handled that routine. I
                    remember, I felt a great triumph one day when I had to write a contract for the
                    building of a new boat dock, because we were on the Grand Canal and we had a
                    motor boat, and the dock needed to be repaired or replaced. I didn't know
                    anything, of course, about writing a contract, and I looked in the regulations,
                    and did what I thought was right. There was a question whether it ought to be a
                    numbered contract or an unnumbered contract. So I read everything six times and
                    decided it should be one or the other. Then I had to send it to the Embassy in
                    Rome for approval. They wrote back and said it should be the one that I hadn't
                    chosen. So I looked at all the regulations again, and I still thought I was
                    right, and I wrote them back explaining why I thought I was right, and they came
                    back and said: “Sorry, we were wrong. You're correct.” I felt that I had won a
                    great triumph.</p>

                    The local employee who handled that was very adept at doing this. We had some
                    rather interesting cases. I remember, we issued a passport to Truman Capote. I
                    once was in an airplane, and the man next to me said: “Did I remember him,”
                    which of course I didn't, and he pulled out his passport and it was one that I
                    had signed. So you never know when things like that will turn up.</p>

                <p>JONES: Yes, I left Venice in the fall of '57, went on home leave and went to
                    Berlin in January of '58. I spent my first tour there as a Visa Officer. Then
                    went on home leave and when I came back I was an Economic Officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of visa work did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I did non-immigrant visas, and that was interesting because we issued some
                    to East German residents. Most of the visas that we issued on the whole were
                    either visits to the United States to relatives, or business trips to West
                    Berliners. The ones we issued to East Germans were either visits to relatives or
                    invitations to conferences, scientific conferences or things of that nature,
                    that it was decided was in our interest to let them attend. Many of these people
                    needed waivers of some sort because they were members of some kind of communist
                    organization. But in most of those cases, it was deemed more or less harmless
                    and in some cases they claimed involuntary membership, that they had to join in
                    order to retain their job or something of that sort. But it was interesting
                    because we had a chance to talk to some of these people, which most people
                    didn't have an opportunity to do. They were able to come across into West Berlin
                    of course without difficulty at that time. Later on, when I was in the Economic
                    Section was when the wall was built of course and that complicated things.</p>

                        the political situation in Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, the number of East Germans crossing into the west was increasing
                    rapidly, and there were many coming over every day. I was not in the political
                    section, I didn't get involved in those discussions whether there was any
                    feeling the East was going to do something to stem this. It was certainly
                    recognized that there was a problem for them, but I don't think that there was
                    any anticipation of the building of a wall, I mean of the complete closing of
                    the border that occurred. It happened on a Saturday night, Sunday morning. I was
                    awakened about four o'clock that Sunday morning by one of the local employees
                    who's beat in effect was transportation, and he had lots of contacts in the
                    railroad, and he said they had called him up and told him they were tearing up
                    train tracks and putting up barriers, etc., and he just wanted to alert me (to
                    be aware of this), and he was going to go out and tour around and try to learn
                    what was happening. I assumed that, by that time, others knew about it as well,
                    but I did call the duty officer to make sure, and he was not home, he had
                    already gone to the office. So, I waited until six thirty or seven to call the
                    office and find out whether there was anything I could do. They suggested that I
                    come in about eight. They were gathering a lot of people to try and figure out
                    what was happening. I did get another call back from this local employee who
                    gave me more details about what was happening at what place, etc. That Sunday we
                    spent a great deal of our time just trying to find out, because you really had
                    to go out and look and see what was going on, and reporting to Washington. I
                    never wrote so many flash cables in my life as I did that day.</p>

                        that this was a prelude to a conflict?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There certainly was a lot of concern that something could happen, because
                    initially there were a lot of troops in East Berlin because they weren't able to
                    have a wall immediately. Many places they just put rolls of barbed wires, but
                    they also had, I remember, a row of East German Volkspolizei (Volpos so called)
                    just standing within a few yards of each other all in a row across where the
                    Brandenburg gate is, and there were Soviet tanks not very far from the West
                    Berlin border. We were still able to drive in if we had the tags for the
                    Mission, and that afternoon I did drive over into East Berlin and toured around
                    a little bit. It was bristling with military at that time certainly. Later on,
                    the Soviets pulled back to the outskirts, but there certainly was a feeling that
                    if we made a move, why, they weren't just going to let us knock the thing down,
                    or eliminate the barbed wire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling, you know I'm trying to go back to
                        the time, about the administration, which was then fairly early on in the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>JONES: I think there was a strong feeling that we had to support West Berlin and
                    the West German government in resisting any encroachment. I'm sure there must
                    have been debates about whether to try to go in and eliminate it, but I think
                    there was certainly good reason for concern that that could precipitate a
                    conflict. We instituted a program for West Berlin to try to support its economy.
                    General Lucius Clay came over and was sort of a supernumerary who was looking at
                    all the things that could be done to support that economy. About a week, six or
                    seven days after the wall went up, then-Vice President Johnson came over, and we
                    sent in another brigade of troops. I remember going out to where the autobahn
                    enters West Berlin to see this cavalcade of army troops coming in. There were
                    Berliners all over the place cheering and you had a good feeling inside. The
                    Vice President had a very successful morale booster visit. There was a parade
                    and thousands of Berliners came out cheering him. You could feel it gave them a
                    tremendous boost, because they were really very concerned of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reading of the economy of Berlin? Were you
                        doing East Germany too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No. We had a section that dealt with East German affairs, but the Economic
                    Section was not involved with East German economy per se. We did concern
                    ourselves with access to Berlin, and I did do some work on East-West trade in
                    terms of trying to figure out who was shipping things through Berlin to the east
                    that were prohibited, that sort of thing. But we didn't really try to evaluate
                    the East German economy. As a matter of fact, at the time that the wall went up,
                    which was of course the month of August when generally business is down and many
                    concerns close, everybody goes on vacation at once. We had a four-person
                    Economic Section, that is, four officers; two of them were on home leave because
                    “nothing ever happens in August.” We also happened to be the chairman of the
                    Allied Control Council at the time, so we were very busy, the two of us, until
                    one of our colleagues returned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our impression about Berlin, from your particular
                        point of view, as an economic entity? Was this a tremendous liability that
                        had to be subsidized?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Berlin of course had been the major industrial city in Germany, and it
                    still had some major industries in the electronics field. I can't remember the
                    details now, but it still was a very important entity for Germany as a whole.
                    The German government provided certain incentives for Germans to move to Berlin,
                    because they were afraid that young people particularly would move out, feeling
                    that there was not as much future there as elsewhere. We, at the time,
                    internationally, were pushing our own exports, but it was agreed that this was
                    not a suitable program for us to push in West Berlin and instead we were trying
                    to promote investments, etc. I don't think it was considered a liability, it was
                    just felt that given the circumstances it needed some extra help and assurance
                    that it wasn't being deserted.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: There I did basically all the consular services except visas. We had a lot
                    of very complicated citizenship cases at the time because of a court decision
                    that had made it possible for various people who had not thought that they had a
                    claim to American citizenship to possibly make a claim. There were adults who
                    had been born, grown up in Italy, and who suddenly discovered that by virtue of
                    a parent they might have a claim to citizenship. Of course, when they learned
                    this, many of them came in to try and do that, and it was fascinating because it
                    was a complicated business of trying to ascertain the history and what they had
                    thought or known about their possible claim to American citizenship. I remember
                    there was a family where there were four sons, and they all were married and had
                    children. They all got American citizenship, and all of their families therefore
                    were eligible for non-quota visas, and this whole group got passports and visas
                    and all went to the United States. It was about sixteen or twenty people. They
                    were all really solid types. These fellows were hard workers, they all had jobs,
                    and I thought: 'This group is going to do well in the United States.'</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Palermo of course is one of the places, and it still is, where they are
                    pretty active. During the last year I was there, they were having a bit of a
                    family warfare. There were a number of incidents of blown up cars. I remember
                    there was another one of our people who lived a couple of blocks away from me,
                    and there was a car blown up in front of her apartment building. None of this
                    was aimed at us foreigners. They were really fighting each other for control.
                    But it was disturbing in a way, but I was never afraid, because it was not
                    something that was aimed at Americans or any other foreigners, but it was
                    certainly something that you didn't expect.</p>

                        particularly on the Chinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, over the years, we certainly did. I remember, one year when it was
                    getting very sticky, I was on the delegation to the General Assembly in New York
                    when the Canadians made their two-China proposal. There was considerable anger
                    among some people in the State Department, that the Canadians had gone on and
                    done this terrible thing. It all seems very strange now. Of course, nothing ever
                    came of the two-China proposal although it seemed at one point that that might
                    be the solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your personal feeling, and some of the officers',
                        dealing with this? The politics were very clear. No, no, no, as far as the
                        admission of Red China, but personally was there the feeling that maybe we
                        ought to take the step and get on with it, or not? How did you all
                        feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think there were a lot of people who would have been happy with a
                    two-China solution. They didn't feel that we should dump Taiwan. At the same
                    time it seemed unrealistic to keep a country the size of China out of the UN,
                    and I think it was felt that inevitably sometime they would be admitted, but the
                    difficulty was to try and find how to do it without going back on your ally. Of
                    course, the main problem there was that neither side wanted two-China; neither
                    the Taiwanese nor the People's Republic were prepared to accept that kind of a
                    solution. I think if they had, why, it would have been resolved much earlier in
                    that way. It was pretty clear that neither one of them were going to give in on
                    that score.</p>

                        assume part of your job was to go out and get people, our Embassy in Chad,
                        to side with us in the UN, and the people in our Embassy in Chad couldn't
                        care less?</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>JONES: We of course sent many instructions out about lots of issues, but that was
                    certainly one of them. Before General Assembly sessions, instructions go out to
                    all Embassies to discuss the upcoming agenda with the government to which they
                    are accredited. Most of them...you know...many countries understood our position
                    on China and they cared enough about relations with the United States, that they
                    would go along with it without much difficulty. You mentioned Chad. Well, I
                    don't know about Chad per se, but for a lot of the small countries, it was not a
                    great issue and if it made us happy to have their support, why, they were
                    prepared to give it. There were others of course who disagreed. India I remember
                    particularly of course was not with us on it. Some of the western countries were
                    getting restive as indicated. The Canadians made this two-China proposal because
                    they felt it was an unrealistic policy to keep this large country out of this
                    organization.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: At that point, I don't recall that there was any strong feeling one way or
                    the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Israel? Was this a problem? Later they got the
                        Zionists as a racist issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes, that happened later. The Arab-Israeli dispute has always been a major
                    issue in the UN, and it's one on which it spends a great deal of time, and we
                    spent a great deal of time as a result. I think over the years some support for
                    Israel has eroded as indicated by the passage by the General Assembly of this
                    resolution on Zionism as racism. It became more and more difficult for us in the
                    General Assembly (for the Israelis with our support and with others) to keep
                    from having things like that adopted. The Security Council is a different animal
                    of course, and there, we have most of the time been able to keep things
                    reasonable. We have of course been highly critical of Israel ourselves on some
                    occasions and have voted to criticize them for various actions. But I think as
                    Israel became stronger, it didn't have the sort of sympathy as when it was first
                    founded and there was a lot of spill over from what had happened during World
                    War II and sympathy for this young struggling country. Now it is of course
                    strong, and there is more sympathy for those, particularly the Palestinians in
                    the occupied territory. It's a very, very difficult problem, and I hope they can
                    make some progress.</p>

                <p>JONES: You couldn't really work with them. I don't know if you can say it was the
                    enemy, but certainly they were obstructionists, and very difficult of course,
                    particularly in the Security Council where there is the veto. In those days, we
                    had never used our veto. As a matter of fact, I remember I was in IO the first
                    time we used our veto. But now of course, we've used it many times. Many times
                    on Arab-Israeli matters, which is indicative of the fact that that was the only
                    way we could stop certain things, whereas earlier it hadn't been necessary to
                    veto. There'd been enough support to prevent certain actions without a veto. The
                    Soviets were very, very difficult. We could talk to them, but it was very hard
                    to come to meeting of minds on things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: I don't remember. I don't have any strong recollections about them during
                    that period. Later on when I was at our Mission, we had good cooperation with
                    the French. We might not always agree entirely, but certainly there was a very
                    good relationship.</p>

                        Nixon administrations. Did you get any feel for the difference between
                        Johnson in the UN and Nixon in the UN? How they felt about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, I can't really say. I don't think either one was eager to deal with
                    our problems through the UN, except, you know, when it seemed we could gain some
                    advantage, but they were not what you would call strong UN supporters, I don't
                    believe. Kissinger of course was the National Security Adviser, and I don't
                    think he felt that the UN was a very useful body in many respects. I don't know.
                    I can't recall anything particular about the Johnson administration's
                    attitude.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>JONES: Well, it was very frustrating at times. Sometimes, you were up there at
                    the UN, you got very wrapped up in some resolution or some problem you were
                    dealing with, it was a world unto itself. But even though you were frustrated
                    and more realistic about what it could do, in the earlier days, you still felt
                    that this was something which did serve a purpose and was helpful. As many
                    people said, if it didn't exist, it would have to be created. The General
                    Assembly, of course, became larger and larger, and one of the things that we
                    really deplored at the time was the creation of the mini-states, and the great
                    enlargement of the organization so that the Assembly became so unwieldy. But as
                    time has gone on, you can see that this was inevitable. There were proposals at
                    the time of how to limit membership, but that became an unrealistic thing. What
                    happened I think is that it became clear that the General Assembly was largely a
                    place where you let off steam, you debate, pass some resolutions, and of course,
                    they do some important things like assessing contributions of member states to
                    the budget and things of that sort, but the power really shifted to the Security
                    Council which always was stronger. But we had earlier tried to give more power
                    to the General Assembly and then I think we shifted away, decided we'd rather
                    depend more on the Security Council for the major political issues. We always
                    recognized that the UN can only do what its member states want it to do, and
                    unless they elect to do something, it's not going to happen. Today, when we talk
                    about the UN doing things in Bosnia, Somalia, etc,. people talk about it as
                    though it's some magic entity that on its own can do something. Well, it can
                    only do what its member states are prepared to have it do.</p>

                    in Jerusalem, we had the October '73 war. It was strange in a way, when I got

                <p>JONES: What I was saying, when I was still in Washington in '67, that was June I
                    think. There was a great feeling that something could be done after that war.
                    The Israelis seemed to be open to negotiations, and prepared to do something to
                    resolve the question because of the great danger of another war. And gradually
                    as things did not work out, things had stalemated considerably. I'm sorry I'm
                    skipping something ...</p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was real hope I think. Abba Eban, in particular, spoke in a way that
                    made you feel there was a real chance for movement. But as you know nothing came
                    of it. Israel retained territories it had occupied during that time, Gaza, and
                    the West Bank, and part of the Golan Heights. As thing moved on, it became less
                    and less likely, and it was pretty much stalemated. What I was thinking about is
                    when I subsequently went to Jerusalem. I skipped Calcutta, I'm afraid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's get back to Calcutta. You were there during
                        the period when East Pakistan peeled off from Pakistan proper. How did that
                        play at the Consulate General level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: We were in a very interesting position because, of course, the Bengalis in
                    West Bengal, where we were, were very sympathetic to East Bengal. We also had
                    all of the thousands of refugees in our consular district. They poured over from
                    the east mainly into West Bengal, and it was a tremendous job to deal with them,
                    to house them and feed them. I rather admired the Indians, how they handled it.
                    Because we would have felt that they had to have much more elaborate set ups for
                    this, whereas the Indians were prepared to do it in such a way that provided the
                    minimal, but did take care of them. In Calcutta, I was head of the Economic
                    Section, and in that connection got involved in some of the aid that we provided
                    during that period. We would meet with the Indian officer who was in charge of
                    assessing the requirements. There were other consulates there who were involved
                    also. We would report what the situation was. I went to the airport many times
                    to meet shipments when they came in to be sure that they were received and dealt
                    with adequately. I also toured the refugee camps with many visiting VIPs. The
                    upheaval was tremendous. Of course, after the war, the Indians made no bones
                    about it. They wanted these people to go back. Many of course wanted to go back,
                    but there was no question that West Bengal, which still had refugees from the
                    days of partition, didn't want any more. We were not very popular at the time,
                    because the government supported Pakistan as an ally. The U.S. was quite
                    supportive of Pakistan to the extent that the Indians felt that we were
                    one-sided and although our personal relations with people were OK, you did hear
                    about it periodically. There were some demonstrations at the USIS library, but
                    nothing that ever caused us any real difficulty.</p>

                <p>JONES: I know we evacuated some people because some of them came. I don't
                    remember if it was closed entirely. It may have been. I think it was. Because we
                    had two evacuations. One from Chittagong by ship, and one when they flew people
                    out from Dacca to Calcutta. We took care of them before they moved on. These
                    journalists would go over, and then they would come and talk to us, and we could
                    then report on what they had to say on what the situation was. So that was an
                    interesting aspect of it. But sympathies certainly were all with the Bengalis.
                    It was felt that the Pakistanis had stolen the elections and that the right was
                    all on the side of what became the Bangladeshis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you arrive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: In July? I think it was July '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And stayed there until '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the situation in the summer of '73?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>JONES: As I alluded to earlier, things were very stalemated. Nothing was
                    happening in terms of resolving the problem, the Arab-Israeli problem. There
                    didn't seem to be any chance of movement. Then the war came and that all
                    changed, and again as in '67 there was hope that this would lead to something
                    that could help resolve the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the war hit Jerusalem where you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well the war itself didn't really affect us very much except that, you
                    know, they call up so many people. A couple of our local employees got called
                    up. One was let go fairly soon after. He was in his fifties. Both of these were
                    drivers and the younger man did stay in for the course of the war. It's a very
                    funny situation where people there go into the army. They go off to war. They
                    come home. They can one day be off somewhere fighting, and the next day be home
                    on a pass, and then two days later be back fighting again. It's a very odd
                    feeling. It's so different from what we're used to where people go miles away
                    and it's a totally separate situation. There was a lot of tension of course,
                    concern. But Jerusalem itself, I don't think ever felt, the city per se, was in
                    danger. Similarly in Calcutta, we never felt any danger during the war, even
                    though we had a blackout for two days but it was pointless, because there was
                    nothing happening in that area. Following the war, we got terribly busy because
                    of the shuttle diplomacy, and because they came to Jerusalem, and were at the
                    King David Hotel, which is not very far from the Consulate, and used our
                    facilities, our communications. So that we had to have a twenty-four hour
                    operation, and we ran messages back and forth between the Consulate and the King
                    David Hotel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Jerusalem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: That's what I was saying earlier. I was the Deputy there, and I was Deputy
                    in Calcutta too, but I was pretty much in the Economic Section, whereas in
                    Jerusalem I was supervisor over the political and economic officers and the
                    consular and administrative sections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: It was Pete Day. Arthur R. Day, during the first two years, and Michael
                    Newlin the third year that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, there's always been the problem of Jerusalem
                        which has been in a way the thorn in the side of the Israelis because of the
                        reporting on Palestinian affairs, particularly on the West Bank. How did
                        that work during your period and what were the pressures on you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>JONES: Well, the Israelis of course resent the fact that we have not recognized
                    Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Jerusalem is an independent post; it's not a
                    constituent post of Tel Aviv, in order to maintain this policy. Its consular
                    district includes the West Bank and the city of Jerusalem, both west and east.
                    That gave us an opportunity to have contact with both sides which is an unusual
                    situation in that area. We were able to report on events in the West Bank and to
                    travel freely, and observe things. And also report on events in Jerusalem and
                    have contacts with city officials. We didn't have any official contact with the
                    Israeli government. That's the province of the Embassy. But we did cover the
                    city and we did have contacts with the mayor and other officials there. It's a
                    very sticky situation because little events would happen. When a congressman
                    came to visit, the Israeli government wanted to, or the mayor's office wanted to
                    give him a tour of East Jerusalem, whereas we felt he should go with us not with
                    West Jerusalem officials. Little things like that. Mostly our relations with
                    them were good, but as I say, they were unhappy. There was a feeling on their
                    part which I don't think is correct, that the consulate in Jerusalem was full of
                    people who were anti-Israeli. That was not fair I think, and I think it was not
                    a feeling that those who had contacts with the Consul General held, because they
                    knew that he was not biased in that way, and in fact had many good Israeli
                    friends, and was very sympathetic to their problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you ever given any, if not instructions, heavy
                        breathing from our Embassy in Tel Aviv, and even from the Department saying:
                        “Cut out talking about Israeli procedures in the West Bank” or anything like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, I don't think so. There were occasional problems of jurisdiction
                    between the Embassy and us, but nothing that I can recall that was ever
                    significant. We would talk to them on the phone frequently, and usually work
                    things out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't any incidents? In that time where a consul
                        would go out and find that an Israeli had been beating up on some villagers.
                        You'd report it and then it would get into the New York or the Washington
                        Post and cause heartburn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I don't recall anything of that nature. You know, you're required to do
                    these annual human rights reports and the Embassy sent in a combined one
                    covering Israel and the occupied territories because Gaza is under its
                    jurisdiction. But we drafted the one on the West Bank and we sent it to them to
                    include, and there might have been a few minor editing changes, but basically,
                    they sent what we had prepared. I don't recall...There may be things I don't
                    remember, but at the moment I don't recall any major difficulty we had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left Jerusalem in '76 and went back to the
                        UN Assembly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I served on the General Assembly delegation in '76 as the NEA liaison
                    officer. They have one for each geographic area, which is basically to maintain
                    contact with delegations from that particular region of the world and follow
                    those problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular concerns...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I don't remember anything special during that three months. There probably
                    were some interesting cases but I...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well if anything comes back you can add it later. Then you
                        went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Then I went to the Royal College of Defense Studies, the former Imperial
                    War College in London, from January to December, 1977. That was a very pleasant
                    experience. We had about twenty nationalities represented in the group, about
                    half military, half civilian, about half British, and half others. We had an
                    Egyptian, and a Saudi Arabian, and an Israeli in the course. During the time I
                    was there was when Sadat made his trip to Jerusalem. We were due to go off on
                    some excursion the day that he arrived in Jerusalem, so most of us went to the
                    College a bit early. We were all going by bus from the College to the airport
                    and watched on television just before we left this event and it was of course a
                    really historic moment. I just couldn't believe it. I was so amazed.
                    Subsequently the Egyptian and the Israeli would talk a bit, not a great deal ,
                    but they at least were on speaking terms. The Saudi Arabian would never have
                    anything to do with the Israeli. The Israeli was an Army Officer who had served
                    in the '73 war. I don't know if he'd been in the '67 war, but I know he'd been
                    in the Sinai in the '73 war. Anyway, it was a very interesting period, as much
                    because of the contacts I had with these people from other countries as from the
                    course itself. They have an outstanding group of lecturers that they bring to
                    the College. It was very worthwhile I felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back, and you went back to the United
                        Nations. You were doing what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I went to the US Mission to the UN.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to New York? You were part of...it was basically an
                        Embassy there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes. I started as the Deputy in the Political Section, and then when the
                    Deputy left I moved up after several months to become the Political
                    Counselor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '78 to '80.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes, from January '78 to July 1980.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main concerns that you were involved
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well, let's see, we had lots of things during that period. One of the
                    things was the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. That was fascinating in a way
                    because of our work with the Chinese. During the period I was there we
                    established diplomatic relations with China and the Chinese just became so
                    friendly you could not believe it. They invited us all to a big dinner to
                    celebrate, etc. They wanted our help. They did not really know much about how to
                    operate tactically in the Security Council. They of course were very interested
                    in the Cambodian question and they consulted us all the time about how to do
                    things. Unfortunately of course, we didn't always agree with what they wanted to
                    do, but it was interesting to have this contact. Prince Sihanouk came at some
                    point and I met him. We had several meetings with him. We also at one point
                    dealt with the hostage situation in our Embassy in Iran. As you know, the
                    government was trying to do anything it could to try and get some contact and
                    resolve that. We did try to work through the UN and through delegations there,
                    and we had some support. The Secretary General tried to assist also, but to no
                    avail at that time. We spent many long hours working on that. The Arab-Israeli
                    dispute of course came up periodically. Cyprus. I'm trying to think. It seems to
                    me there were some other major questions. Oh well, in connection with the
                    Arab-Israeli dispute, there was the problem of Lebanon and it was during that
                    time that we established what is known as UNIFIL, UN Interim Force in Lebanon.
                    We worked closely with the Secretariat, mainly Brian Urquhart and his section
                    who dealt with peacekeeping operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peacekeeping?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: He was the head of peacekeeping activities in the Secretariat and the
                    establishment of that force. So that was a major question. The Security Council
                    was very active during that period. We worked closely with the Lebanese
                    Ambassador. The Kuwaiti Ambassador. He was at that time on the Security Council.
                    They were quite reasonable men. We worked as well with the Israeli Mission. And
                    of course, the British and the French, we usually consulted initially with them
                    about things. I don't remember who else was on the Council. It was a very
                    interesting period. That was of course the period when Ambassador Young got
                    fired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was your Ambassador. How did you find Andrew Young? How
                        did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>JONES: I think he was quite effective. He is very good with people. He was
                    well-liked and he was quite active in keeping in touch with other delegations. I
                    personally liked him. He's a very personable man, I think. Not the best
                    organized sometimes, but that can be said of a lot of us. But he was, I think,
                    as with many political appointees, a little uncertain about us professionals
                    when he first got there, but we had a good working relationship with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He came a cropper for dealing with the Palestinian
                        Liberation Organization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see this coming, or was he aware, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: No, I don't think we saw... It is a little bit typical in that he would
                    get an idea in his head and sometimes go ahead. Sometimes he would ask someone
                    about it, and they would give him some advice and he would back off. Well, this
                    time he just decided to go and do it. It was unfortunate, I think, because he
                    was a good Ambassador and I think was very well-liked which was very evident. He
                    happened to be president of the Security Council at the time and the last
                    meeting that he chaired, there were very many warm tributes to him. He was very
                    much liked by the other delegates. They were sorry to see him go. His successor,
                    Don McHenry, was also very popular. He is a very talented fellow. I happened to
                    have known him many years before when he too was in the Bureau of International
                    Organization Affairs, way back when. So we'd known each other for many years. He
                    is very, very bright, a very smart fellow. He did an excellent job there I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have the feeling that Andrew Young, obviously
                        coming out of the civil rights movement was equating the American experience
                        of civil rights with the problems of Africa and was making too much of a
                        transposition to that? Did he see things in those terms? How did you find
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>JONES: I don't know that I can really answer that. As far as the Arab-Israeli
                    dispute, the irony was that he was really very supportive of Israel, and
                    sympathetic certainly to the Palestinian viewpoint, but also very sympathetic to
                    the Israeli side. I think he just felt he should talk to somebody on the
                    Palestinian side. As far as African problems, my Deputy followed them much more
                    than I did. One of the things that was going on at the time was the question of
                    Namibia. At that point, we almost got... You know, we were so close to an
                    agreement that it seemed inevitable that it would come. In fact, we did a lot of
                    work with the UN in setting up the UN observer force there, etc. We had a couple
                    of military people come up to discuss various aspects with them. In fact, at the
                    time that it finally came to pass—Namibia got its independence many years
                    later—I tried to call Don McHenry who was very, very much involved in that
                    situation to congratulate him on the event that finally took place. He'll be
                    able to tell you a lot about that. Of course he worked with Ambassador Young on
                    it also, but he was the point-man. So on a question of that sort, of course,
                    Young was very supportive of the Namibian cause, but then that was US policy
                    across the board, so there was no problem about that. I don't know that... He
                    was sympathetic to situations of that sort, the situation in South Africa, in
                    Namibia, generally, but I think he also tried to see both sides of the issue.
                    He's not a wild man. In the civil rights movement, he was I think in many ways,
                    the sort of intellectual in Martin Luther King's entourage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're right. He was mainstream civil rights. What was
                        your impression of the support for the United Nations in the United States?
                        We're talking about the '78 to '80 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I think it was less than it had been in the early days of the UN
                    certainly. There was more disillusionment, frustration, but I think there was
                    still considerable support and hope for it, and there was a lot of activity on
                    things of major interest to us, like the Arab-Israeli dispute, the situation in
                    Lebanon, the Cambodian affair, what it would try to do on the hostages, etc. I
                    think it was later on that things got ... that the support waned, and I think
                    the US government became more frustrated and disillusioned and did less to
                    support it and use it. Now, of course, things have turned around again.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has its times and its non-times. You left the US/UN and
                        went to arms control and disarmament, where you served from '80 to '82. What
                        were you doing there?</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>JONES: I was in charge of an office which dealt with the multi-lateral aspects of
                    arms control primarily. The Geneva Committee on Disarmament, I think they
                    changed their names... We also handled...there were negotiations on chemical
                    weapons with the British and Soviets. That treaty finally was agreed to much
                    later. We thought we were pretty close at the time. In the General Assembly,
                    there is one committee that deals almost exclusively with arms control matters.
                    We handled the instructions for... I mean, not us alone, but that office works
                    with the State Department and the Department of Defense, primarily those three
                    on that matter. The comprehensive test ban treaty, there were negotiations on
                    that that we were also involved in. At the time of the great germ warfare claim

                <p>JONES: Yes, in Cambodia. We thought we had evidence that they had used germ
                    warfare. I think ultimately now it has been decided that it was probably not the
                    case, but at the time it looked as though it were. In our office was a chemical
                    expert, and he was skeptical, very skeptical. There was a great push politically
                    to...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Reagan administration too, wasn't it? There
                        was an ideological push towards it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There was publicity and claims about this at an earlier stage that we
                    thought was unwise, but, in any case, that's long water over the dam. At the
                    time, I went into ACDA just before the election... Let's see, I came down here
                    in July, after some leave and went to work. The new administration came in of
                    course at the beginning of the year and everything came to a screeching halt
                    because they wanted to review all policies. We had great difficulty because we
                    couldn't stop the meetings. The multilateral meetings of course went on, and we
                    had to have something to say, and take a position on resolutions, etc. It was
                    very, very difficult for a period of about six to eight months, because to get
                    any instruction to our representative was very difficult. I sympathized with
                    Chuck Flowerree who was sitting there trying to...</p>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>JONES: We had a career man who was our representative in Geneva which was the
                    permanent arms control forum, not the later talks with the Soviets. I'm not
                    talking about that. This is an international group. He had to take positions,
                    you know, and when the United States doesn't have a position on some of these
                    things, it makes it all rather meaningless, so we would at the last minute get
                    an OK on something. Anyway, we got through it eventually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Soviets in their dealings
                        with us? Were they trying to reach an accommodation, to their own advantage?
                        Were they really interested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Oh, I think they were interested; yes, in their own interest, as you say.
                    Arms control is something which I think was in their own interest as much as
                    ours. We of course would emphasize things like inspections, etc. But some of our
                    military people got a little uncertain about how much inspection we wanted to
                    submit to. It was always hard negotiations, I think, but as it turned out,
                    agreements are possible when it is to the advantage of both sides.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved to EUR for a couple of years, is that
                        right? What were you doing there from '83 to '85. And you were in the BEX
                        for a year, was that about then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I was at the Board of Examiners for a year and that was interesting to see
                    the applicants and interview them. I also got a couple of trips to Austin,
                    Texas, and to Los Angeles, to spend a couple of weeks there examining people. I
                    was impressed by the change from when I got out of college. People who were
                    going into the Foreign Service at that time, I think, were younger, had fewer
                    graduate degrees, etc. Now, I realized that the average age was higher and that
                    many of them had some graduate degrees or outside working experience, etc. The
                    competition was tremendous, and I admired those who made it through, because out
                    of the thousands that take the exam, there's a relatively small number that are
                    accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a push even at that time to try to get more
                        women in to the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: When I first went there, there was a special program for women and
                    minorities. Subsequently, the women side was dropped because it was clear that
                    they were getting adequate number of women applicants. There had been of course
                    a fairly small number of women, so there was an effort to bring some in at the
                    mid-level under the special program. Now, there's no question. As a matter of
                    fact, when I got out of college, I was somewhat discouraged from trying for the
                    Foreign Service then, because it was so difficult for a woman. That was one of
                    the reasons I didn't apply at that time.</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>JONES: I was in the Office of Regional Political/Economic Affairs which handled
                    our relations with the EEC, both economic and political, handled east-west
                    trade, and the Council of Europe. It seems to me there's something else. Oh yes,
                    the OECD. We did COCOM, east-west trade. I concentrated more... I was the Deputy
                    and sort of helped run the office, as Executive Officer, and dealt more with
                    east-west trade side and political aspects of the EEC and Council of Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the major issues that you dealt with? Any major
                        issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: The EEC was beginning to move toward the integration of Europe. I've been
                    surprised they've moved as far as they have. There were many, as there always
                    are, I guess, trade disputes which we were involved in with them. On the
                    east-west trade side, there's a considerable difference of opinion within the
                    government about whether we should relax some of these things because we were
                    losing out in competition with some others. I think, of course, now that
                    situation has changed considerably with the break up of the Soviet Union.
                    Super-computers, I remember, were a big item. I can't remember precisely what
                    the trade disputes were about, but there were some really big ones which came
                    very, very close between us and the EEC, and we would go right to the very edge
                    and then they'd...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure if it was at that time, but there was oil
                        pipes, or gas pipes, and special turbines that could be used for
                        submarines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: There were some agricultural products that we had problems with. We dealt
                    with the Office of the Trade Representative, and the Agriculture Department if
                    they were involved, and it was often difficult to come to a US government
                    position on some of these things where there were differing interests pulling
                    one way or the other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Defense Department too, I assume, got into the act,
                        didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: Well yes, on east-west trade, very much, yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>JONES: Yes, I was head of the Office of Performance Evaluation, which administers
                    the program. They didn't evaluate people, but at that time, we had both the
                    Foreign Service and the Civil Service. I think they've reorganized things a bit,
                    but we set up all the selection boards for the Foreign Service, for instance,
                    and we prepared the instructions on how to write an evaluation, and we collected
                    them all, and we tried to persuade people to get them in. Of course we serviced
                    the boards when they were in session, prepared all their reports, checked and
                    double-checked them, then we published the names. We did the performance pay
                    board. The senior executive service has special awards also which we handled,
                    and the Civil Service performance evaluation system changed a bit during that
                    time. So that needed new instructions. It's a very taxing job, and people in
                    that office work very, very hard.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JONES: Their work is very tedious, but terribly important. We handled cases where
                    people were unhappy and they would come in and talk to us about something, and
                    then they'd sometimes file a grievance. They also have the junior officers
                    coming in. The tenure board was also handled there, in order to be tenured. We
                    were also in the process of being computerized at the time I was there, and
                    hadn't gotten too far along. I hope it has now, because we were dealing with
                    many little cards, and if that could be computerized, it would make life a lot
                    simpler, because keeping a card on every person and keeping it accurate was not
                    always the easiest thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you retired in 1987. I would like to ask one final
                        question, Betty. You came in shortly after the war. Now, in the last junior
                        officer class, about 50% were women. The integration has happened. When you
                        came in, how did you find it, particularly in the earlier days, being a
                        woman was a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JONES: I, personally, had a pretty good experience. There were times when I can
                    remember people making remarks. During my intern days, it was a State Department
                    official who advised women to get jobs as secretaries and then move up, which is
                    of course the wrong thing to do. You know, you would never have told a man to do
                    that. There was a time when I was supposed to have an assignment, and the Consul
                    General didn't want me, because he didn't want a woman. He was able to say that.
                    He said it in such a way that he didn't think it was a good idea for a woman to
                    come for this position considering so and so and so. But nevertheless that
                    wouldn't happen anymore and actually I went to the same post a year later. But
                    on the whole I got along very well with people. I worked of course with lots of
                    men, and mostly men bosses, but not always. I had a couple of women bosses too.
                    I have no real complaint. I know one fellow I knew at the time said: “You'll get
                    along alright as long as you do your job, that's what matters, that's what
                    people care about.”</p>
