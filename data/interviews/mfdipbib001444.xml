                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 18, 2002. This is an interview with William
                        A. Root. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, and I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. Well, let's start at
                        the beginning. Could you tell me something about when and where you were
                        born and something about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: I was born in Massachusetts September, 20, 1923.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where in Massachusetts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: We lived in Hingham on the south shore just 13 miles south of Boston. My
                    dad and mother both came from Colorado. He was at MIT and she at Wellesley, so
                    they both were studying in Massachusetts. Dad was an architect. I had a blissful
                    17 years in Hingham, a lovely place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk a little, go back with your father to
                        begin with. Where does his family come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well his dad was an assayist (looking at minerals to see what was in them)
                    in Colorado. That is a center of mining, of course. His father was Joseph
                    Pomeroy Root who was ambassador to Chile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my goodness. Did the fact that you had a what was it,
                        grandfather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: This was my dad's grandfather, my great-grandfather.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great-grandfather was a diplomat, did that sort of ring
                        through the generations? Did you know about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ROOT: Not particularly. I didn't really discover this until quite late. But I am
                    rather proud of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on your mother's side? What was her family
                        name, and where did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Her family name was Eppich, which evolved in the German. It had been Ebig
                    which is pronounced about the same. Before that it was Ewig. I am sure your
                    German is good enough to know that it means eternal. So, on my mother's side, we
                    don't need Ponce De Leon to find the fountain of youth. We had it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, do you know how your mother's family got to
                        Colorado, and what were they up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. My grandfather and his family were in Chicago during the Chicago fire.
                    At that time he was very young, only about four or five years old. In the
                    confusion he got separated from his parents for about a week. Somebody must have
                    taken care of him. I never did find out. His mother, my great-grandmother,
                    seeing the fire come, threw her china out the window to save it, which wasn't a
                    very good idea. Then they moved to Colorado, where my grandfather was eventually
                    in the real estate business. My great-grandmother wasn't very happy with
                    Colorado. She thought this was too rustic, not as civilized as Chicago. She used
                    to look east at Chicago and shed a few tears at what she had left behind.</p>
                <p>Q: What was you mother studying at Wellesley.</p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, she became a school teacher. I frankly don't know her major studies.
                    It was probably a general academic course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother and father meet while they were at
                        Wellesley-MIT?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: No, they went to the same high school in Denver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you grew up in Hingham for the first 17 years. That
                        would be up to 1940. With your father being an architect, did he specialize
                        in any particular thing or was he a general architect or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, he had been a member of the firm Cram and Ferguson until the
                    depression came on. Then they let him go. There is a long story about that.
                    Thereafter he was on his own. He did school buildings and churches mostly. He
                    did quite a few buildings for Exeter, the boarding school in New Hampshire, and
                    a school and a church in Hingham.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Hingham like in the 30's and late 20's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well Hingham was a bedroom community. Most of the workers went to Boston,
                    commuted by train. My brother and I used to accompany my mother to meet the
                    train. This was a big part of the day. When we had a visitor for Sunday dinner,
                    the visitor as is customary asked the small boys, well what do you want to do
                    when you grow up? My brother said he wanted to be the engineer on the train.
                    Then he turned to me, what do I want to be? I wanted to be the passenger. I
                    managed to achieve my ambition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to public schools in Hingham?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, let's start with elementary school. How
                        did you do in elementary school, and do you recall any of the things you
                        were doing that you particularly liked or didn't like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, it was very pleasant, a very small south school. It was a three room
                    school with four grades, so two of them were obviously in the same room. The
                    principal was also the teacher of the third and fourth grade.. Then I went to
                    Center School, which was fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, with fifth and sixth
                    grades also in the same room. So I had two teachers for four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find sort of today, I suppose in some parts of
                        the country it is still there, how did you find having two grades being
                        taught in one room? Were you picking up both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Oh, yes. You were always listening to what the other people were doing. It
                    was pretty informal, of course, but it worked. I actually combined first and
                    second grade in one year, thereby being double promoted. So I had two teachers
                    in one year, and one for two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you much of a reader in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ROOT: Oh, yes. What I remember most clearly is the family reading. Mom and Dad
                    would take a book like “Les Miserables” and read it to the kids and take turns
                    reading. It was a cozy experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home, was it sort of you all gathered together for
                        evening meal and talk about things too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. We invariably sat down as a family for breakfast and for dinner, and
                    there was a lot of conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the family politics? This was the time of the
                        New Deal with Roosevelt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: The first election I remember was FDR in '32. My mother frowned on alcohol,
                    and she couldn't quite abide this idea of repealing the 18th amendment to permit
                    the legalization of alcohol, so she voted for Hoover rather than for FDR because
                    of that. But, thereafter, I am sure they voted Democrat in presidential
                    elections for years. That didn't mean they were straight Democratic voters,
                    because there were a number of Democrats with not very savory reputations in the
                    Boston area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, James Michael Curry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That's right. People like Saltonstall and Lodge had very good reputations.
                    They were Republican. So I am sure my folks split their tickets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the '30s how had the depression hit Hingham and
                        your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, it hit hard. My dad lost his job, and there weren't very many people
                    looking for architects in those days. He eventually got a job with the WPA,
                    Works Progress Administration, not with pick and shovel but a desk job. We ran
                    up bills at the grocery store. Sooner or later you had to pay them. We knew what
                    beans and macaroni were all about; be sure of that. But it never seemed to spoil
                    our day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am five years younger than you are, but I recall,
                        everybody else is more or less in the same boat. I mean if the water was
                        down, all the boats went down. In other words we were all living sort of the
                        same way, so you weren't feeling particularly envious that you were left
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: No it was just struggling to get along.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You go to high school right about '35.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: '37 to '40.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '37 to '40. What subjects were you particularly interested
                        in in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: I was particularly interested in math, physics, things like that. Of course
                    we had Latin and French and English and social studies, the usual. One of the
                    things I remember most vividly was that the algebra teacher was very new to the
                    subject. She sensed that I was catching on pretty well, so she often deferred to
                    me. That was amusing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, were you reading the paper at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, the Boston Herald. There were two things about the Boston Herald
                    besides reading it that were memorable. One was it only cost about two cents. My
                    dad would usually pay for it with a nickel and bring the three pennies home, and
                    I collected pennies. The other thing was a cartoon in the Boston Herald. Dahl
                    was the cartoonist. He was quite often the topic of the dinner conversation,
                    what was in that cartoon. Mr. Dahl had a great deal of trouble drawing cows and
                    bulls because he didn't know the relationship between the horns and the ears.
                    But yes, the Boston Herald came every day, as did the Christian Science Monitor.
                    I won't say I read them both cover to cover, but they were certainly part of the
                    family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you were in high school, what major things
                        were happening in Europe and the far east. Were these part and parcel of
                        what you were picking up, or were these over the horizon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well it seemed a long way off. I remember one very embarrassing thing. It
                    was right after the German occupation of France in 1940. I was in French class
                    at the time, and one of my colleagues wrote on the blackboard, “French is a dead
                    language.” It didn't go over very well, but it is something you remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school, did serving abroad mean
                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, it didn't really occur to me at the time. That didn't come until much
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in high school, particularly towards the
                        end, were you seeing military service sort of hovering over your head?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, that didn't happen until December 7, 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a draft before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, but I was too young for that. I didn't turn 18 until just before Pearl

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: 1940.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you go on to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, I went to Colorado College which is where my dad had gone before he
                    transferred to MIT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you going to major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: I didn't know. It was a liberal arts college, and it was in Colorado which
                    had much to speak for it. I was fascinated principally in political science, not
                    so much the subject, but because of the professor, Edith Bramhall. A cousin of
                    ours, Sherman Sheppard, studied under Edith Bramhall. He had nothing but praise
                    for her. She was quite a character actually, so that is what I started majoring
                    in. But I changed my major after Pearl Harbor to math and physics, because I
                    figured political science wasn't exactly going to keep me out of the trenches
                    whereas math and physics might.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to graduate from Colorado College prior to
                        military service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: I managed to do this by enlisting in the navy in the V-7 program which
                    encouraged finishing college first, and also by finishing a four year course in
                    three years by going to summer school. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to
                    graduate before military service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you were in the V-7 program. Did you go directly
                        into the navy then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well there were a few months in the summer of '43 before they called me up.
                    During those months I worked at the shipyard in Hingham. It turned out I was
                    helping to build the very type of ship I actually served on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Destroyer escorts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got out of the V-7 program, they took you
                        somewhere to turn you into an ensign didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: They sent me to Northwestern midshipman school. The usual four year
                    Annapolis course was condensed into four months. They called us 90 day wonders,
                    but it was really 120.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Having your math and science, I would imagine you weren't
                        struggling the way liberal arts graduates might.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: It was quite presumptuous of me, but when I did switch to math and physics,
                    primarily to stay out of the trenches, I was thinking of the last war you know,
                    where they had trenches. World War I is what everybody remembered. I figured I
                    would join the navy, which is relatively comfortable unless it is extremely
                    uncomfortable, and I would become a radar officer. Radar was the great thing
                    just coming over the horizon. That is exactly what happened. They sent me from
                    Northwestern midshipman school to Harvard for three months for pre-radar and MIT
                    for another four months for the radar training. So I ended up in all these ivy
                    league schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, I am curious. What did they teach you in radar?
                        You know you look at the screen. Did you take the machine apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: This wasn't just to look at. This was so you would understand how it
                    functioned. Basically they were preparing you to repair the stuff if it went
                    down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we are talking about '44 by the time you...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well by that time it was '44.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So where did they assign you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>ROOT: After those schools they assigned me to a division of destroyer escorts.
                    They didn't have enough radar officers one for each ship, so they assigned me to
                    six ships. None of the six were at Pearl Harbor when I got there, so they put me
                    on a seventh one to catch up with the other six. So I served on seven different
                    destroyer escorts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they send you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well they say join the navy to see the world. I joined the navy, and I saw
                    a lot of water. We didn't get to see much of anything. We were escorting task
                    forces basically providing an anti submarine shield.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this in the Pacific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: The Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How significant from your perspective was the Japanese
                        submarine menace?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well to tell you the truth, we never found a Japanese submarine. We weren't
                    terribly disappointed at that, so from personal experience I can hardly say the
                    Japanese submarine menace was all that disconcerting, but of course, they were
                    out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you say I am curious. As a radar officer, what did you
                        do, go from one ship to another to sort of look over and sort of see how
                        things were going?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, yes. There were enlisted seamen who were technicians, and they could
                    generally keep things going. They knew much more about the radios and things
                    like that than I did because I skipped from knowing absolutely nothing about
                    electronics to this sophisticated radar. Anything in between was a blank to me.
                    But I remember once my ego was bolstered because we were out there on the ocean.
                    The navy communicates with these flags you know. The flag signal said send Root
                    over with the mail. Our ship had been to port more recently than the rest of
                    them, so we had mail for these other ships. So we pulled up alongside and threw
                    a rope over. It is called a breeches buoy, sort of like a gunny sack with two
                    holes. You put your feet in, and they throw the duffel bag on top of you and
                    they start a pulley arrangement to move you from one ship to the other. The
                    ships were rocking like this. I looked down and one minute it was 20 feet at
                    least to the water, and the next minute my feet would be in the water. I got
                    over to the other ship without any mishap. My first question was, “What is wrong
                    with the radar? Why are you so anxious to have me over here?” “Well nothing is
                    wrong with the radar. The commodore wants a fourth for bridge.” But there was a
                    time when my work on the radar was appreciated. We were in the midst of a
                    typhoon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the great typhoon that Halsey...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That's right the great typhoon. Hundreds of ships out there, and the order
                    came to break ranks. Normally we were in rigid formation. We would have to be
                    exactly so far from this ship and so forth. But the weather got so bad that the
                    commander knew that each ship or type of ship could weather it in a different
                    manner. So we broke ranks and, of course, that made it particularly important to
                    have radar so you knew where the other ships were. Our surface radar took that
                    moment to quit. Fortunately the air search radar, which only goes into the air,
                    would pick up ships because we were rocking so heavily. So it wasn't that we
                    couldn't find the ships; we just used the air search for it. But imagine trying
                    to repair this delicate electronic surface search instrument when you were
                    rocking about 45 or 50 degrees. But we managed to fix it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was very dangerous. A number of destroyer escorts
                        went down, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, probably. We didn't hear much about what was happening unless it was
                    on our ship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think there is a good portrayal of this in the

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: My wife likes to tell people that, although it took six ships to happen, I
                    experienced everything that is in that Caine Mutiny story. We had a crazy
                    skipper; we ran aground. Everything happened that shouldn't have happened.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: No. Radar can't stop you from running aground.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well it served its purpose. I did my little bit and was not in the
                    trenches, and I lived well. It was reasonably challenging to be working on
                    something complicated, but it got pretty boring after awhile. I decided while I
                    was out there that, after the war, the real problem our country was going to
                    face was getting along with the Soviet Union. That is when I started thinking
                    about international affairs. It wasn't until then. So the navy treated me well,
                    but not to the point that I wanted to stay with it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. We didn't know it. We sensed that we probably were. We certainly had
                    no prospects of returning to the States until the war with Japan was over.</p>

                <p>ROOT: No, we didn't get there.</p>

                    radar picket ships.</p>
                <p>ROOT: Since I was moved from ship to ship, I managed to time my moves quite
                    conveniently in hindsight. Two of the six were hit by kamikaze, and I didn't
                    happen to be on them at the time.</p>

                    except that my mother went to high school with her house mother. My mother said,
                    “Be sure to look up Hazel Haines,” which didn't strike me as something I wanted

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, my mentor was a chap named John Hazard who was the first fellow of
                    the Institute of Current World Affairs to be sent to Moscow to study law. In
                    fact I think he is the only one who has gone to Moscow to study law. He was
                    great. He sensed the politics and he knew prejudices that were in the class. He
                    started out his class with a statement along the following lines. He said, “Of
                    course I appreciate that none of you are going to change your opinions as a
                    result of this class. We all know that we have formed our opinions by the age of
                    15. Thereafter we go through life documenting them.” This, of course, was a
                    challenge to prove him wrong. It certainly opened up our minds. Then Philip
                    Moseley was on the foreign affairs, foreign policy side of the Russian picture.
                    He was pretty much a hawk. Hazard was looking at it from the domestic legal
                    point of view inside of Soviet governmental institutions. Then there was Burgess
                    on economics. He was looking at it academically. It wasn't communism versus
                    capitalism, but rather how does it really work. Then Ernie Simmons on literature
                    and Gerard Robinson on history. He was a real authority. But, except for
                    Moseley, I didn't sense any of them as being particularly ideological.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were taking Russian then I assume too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: I started studying Russian while I was still in the navy in San Francisco.
                    So when I got to Columbia I entered into the second semester. In retrospect,
                    this was a mistake. I should have started all over again. Unfortunately, the
                    State Department never sent me to Russia on tour, so I never had the chance to

                <p>ROOT: I wanted to get into international affairs in the government. I started out
                    in the Bureau of the Budget in the International Activities Branch. I found that
                    this was a wonderful way to start a government career on the civil side. It is a
                    pretty heady experience. The phone rings; you pick it up and say, “Executive
                    Office of the President.” But you do get a wonderful perspective on how many
                    people are involved in international affairs, not just the State Department by
                    any means.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, what particular slice of the pie were you given?</p>
                <p>ROOT: In the Bureau of the Budget the International Activities Branch had only
                    about eight or ten people, so we all were concerned with a broad range of
                    subjects. The Bureau reviewed administrative management questions and
                    legislative proposals as well as budgets. I was reviewing the Point Four program
                    which Truman initiated. But most of the time I was reviewing budget proposals
                    from the agencies, particularly the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the Bureau of the Budget, what was the reputation
                        of in the late 40's, the State Department, how it was managed and used its
                        money and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, it was our job to be skeptical. Therefore we did not put the State
                    Department on a pedestal and say you are so smart we don't need to look at your
                    budget. At the same time, it got to me after awhile. Here I was still wet behind
                    the ears, a GS-5 or 6, a real low level bureaucrat, and putting Assistant
                    Secretaries of State through their paces: Why do you need a million dollars for
                    this or $100,000 for that? So after a couple of years, I thought the thing to do
                    was transfer to the State Department, get some experience there, find out what
                    it was really like, and then go back. I did transfer to the State Department in
                    May 1950, after two years in the Bureau of the Budget. About ten years later, in
                    between Stated Department assignments, by which time I had become a Foreign
                    Service Officer, I went back to the Bureau of the Budget and said, “Well, here I
                    am Put me to work.” The response was: “Oh, we can't touch you; you are tainted.
                    You are a Foreign Service Officer. You can't be expected to be objective.” I
                    thought this was a little sad.</p>

                <p>ROOT: I was in the European bureau executive office. At that time NATO was just

                    having to do with NATO.</p>

                <p>ROOT: In those days virtually everybody in Washington in the State Department was
                    civil service. The Foreign Service was just that; they were foreign. They were
                    outside of the country. Therefore the concept of civil service versus foreign
                    service in Washington didn't arise. The foreign service people were out there
                    someplace. They were receiving our instructions.</p>

                        who were in a foreign country and obviously, I mean it is a different
                        game.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: You are quite correct. The same reaction took place in '52. Even though I
                    was still civil service, I was sent to Germany on assignment. This was most
                    unusual. It was called the exchange program. Once in awhile there would be
                    exceptions made, foreign here, civil service here. They gave me a Foreign
                    Service Staff rating of some sort, and I went out to the High Commission for
                    Germany to work in the executive office there.</p>

                <p>ROOT: '52 to '55. During this period my principal task was to tell people it was
                    time to go home. We were winding up; the occupational functions were being
                    transferred gradually to the Germans. The State Department had taken over
                    occupational functions from the Army just a few years before that. At the time I
                    went, there were more State Department American personnel in Germany than in the
                    rest of the world combined. This couldn't last, of course, especially since the
                    Germans were, not so slowly, taking over these functions. The way it worked we
                    identified roughly half of these numerous Americans who should be sent home.
                    Most of them figured well, not quite yet. We have not quite finished what we set
                    out to do. And they would appeal this directive. Half of the appeals were
                    successful, and the other half were not. That meant that instead of cutting by
                    half, we only cut by a quarter. Six months later you did it all over again. I
                    was there for three years. I was on my sixth round of this sort of thing when I
                    identified my own job as surplus and went home.</p>

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>ROOT: We lived very well. After all we were an occupying force. We had occupation
                    funds as well as appropriated funds to support us. We were living in what was
                    known as the golden ghetto, which has its downside as well. You don't get to
                    know the local people very well if you are just hobnobbing with Americans. But
                    many of the Americans in Germany at that time had been there since the end of
                    the war, some even before that. Yes, it had become a way of life, and they knew
                    that when they went back home the lifestyle would be less high off the hog.</p>

                <p>ROOT: There was no embassy when I arrived. There was a U.S. High Commission for
                    Germany. Of course there were British and French counterparts. It was called
                    U.S. HICOG. The top dog was not an ambassador, he was a high commissioner. Now,
                    by the time I left, that was phased into an embassy. It wasn't that the embassy
                    took over. HICOG simply became the embassy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, although at my level, we didn't have that much to do with high
                    commissioners, so it didn't make too much difference. But I think there was a
                    different tone. I remember one particular. In going through the roster of
                    positions trying to decide which ones we didn't need any longer, there was an
                    office of scientific affairs, a science advisor. One of the appeals from that
                    office went as far as Conant. He said, he didn't think he needed a science
                    advisor, so in that sense it made a difference.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Well Adenauer's star was rising rapidly. He had a very high reputation. The
                    friction in the handover was caused more by American officials, understandably,
                    wanting to finish what they had started and make sure that things didn't get
                    dropped between the cracks. Were the Germans really going to proceed with
                    decartelization and deconcentration, things like that, that we thought were so
                    important.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: By the time I got to Germany in '52, of course the Marshall Plan was well
                    underway. It had started about four years before that. The transition from enemy
                    status to object of reconstruction assistance had been accomplished. A few years
                    later Germany became an ally in NATO; but that was after the Korean 1953
                    armistice. There were occasions when there were mixed feelings. For instance my
                    brother was shot down over Normandy. It was Germans who shot him down. Well it
                    was their job to do it. You can't fault them particularly, but it is hard to put
                    that behind you.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: I am sure there was tremendous variation in effectiveness, just as one
                    would expect wide variations among people. But it really wasn't put to the test
                    particularly after my arrival because the KRO positions were being

                <p>ROOT: No. But I think that our living situation was not conducive to seeing signs
                    one way or the other. We were surrounded by our own folk. Especially in
                    administrative jobs such as my own. My wife and I did get out to meet Germans
                    socially, but not through official capacity. We joined a local church, that sort
                    of thing, but there was almost no way we would have become aware of a resurgence
                    of Nazism which is one of the problems of the way we were living.</p>

                    had come along which resulted in my becoming a Foreign Service Officer without
                    the messiness of taking the exam or anything of that sort. So this time when I
                    went back to Washington, I was a Foreign Service Officer.</p>

                <p>ROOT: I became a budget officer for the European bureau. The next four years I

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well it is much more important than the high officials of the bureau would
                    recognize. We had big issues such as whether to build a new building for NATO in
                    Paris which would cost millions of dollars, but the kinds of issues we got from
                    the top brass were, the consul general in Bermuda wants an air mail subscription
                    to the New York Times, and we think that if it was sent by surface mail we could
                    maybe save $100. He doesn't really need it by air mail, although they might take
                    the opposite approach. But it was that kind of issue, or whether the ambassador
                    in Copenhagen should get $10,000 rather than $8,000 for the representation
                    allowance. These were piddling things, but they hit home to the perks for the
                    more senior officers, and that is what they thought were the budget issues. The
                    biggest budget issue I had was working on Eleanor Dulles. She was very keen on
                    Berlin, helping Berlin get back on its feet. She wanted to build a hospital in
                    Berlin and a conference hall. Of course, what she wanted to do generally
                    happened. But in terms of finding the money and making sure she didn't exceed
                    statutory authority, that was something else again. So I did my best to keep her
                    out of jail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how did you deal with Eleanor Dulles? She sort of,
                        people I have talked to said she sort of insinuated herself over everyone
                        else, the authority over Berlin and kept this for a long time. She would
                        sort of appear and you don't see any particular control over her.</hi>

                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, there wasn't. But she was good hearted, and Berliners of course,
                    loved her. It might have been a little excess expenditure on a conference hall
                    and hospital, especially on the conference hall perhaps. I don't think the

                <p>ROOT: Well, Burke Elbrick was Assistant Secretary for Europe and Art Stevens was
                    the executive director to whom I reported. I didn't have all that much to do
                    with Mr. Elbrick unless it was an air mail subscription and that sort of issue.
                    Seriously there wasn't. At my then level, you don't hobnob with the assistant
                    secretary very much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well we certainly were not picking up positions in droves. We attempted
                    something known as full staffing. The army, of course, the military in general
                    had many more people than they had operational positions, and the excess is
                    always in training someplace. The State Department didn't. So the State
                    Department sent some to training and left some positions vacant. Not only that,
                    even if it weren't for training, home leave or just the time between assignments
                    when they were packing up, that sort of thing, there would invariably be
                    vacancies because we didn't have more people than positions. So we calculated
                    the number of people we would need to keep the positions filled and made a
                    budget pitch for that which didn't go over very well on the hill. That much I
                    remember, but it wasn't as if we were being cut back severely. That happened
                    much later.</p>

                    his questions hit close to the bone. So one did a lot of work to prepare for a
                    hearing before John Rooney. Sometimes it paid off; but sometimes you can't

                        was there a pecking order budgetwise in the European Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, in '55 the dominance of Germany in the budget was much reduced, but
                    it was still there. There was a tendency Germany has had its share, now it is
                    somebody else's turn. To that extent, yes. We had other types of crises, for
                    instance the visa mills in Frankfurt and in Canada required adequate staffing in
                    order to avoid insufferable delays. So, priorities were sometimes give to
                    relatively non-political type jobs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about France? We had some pretty powerful ambassadors

                <p>ROOT: Interestingly enough, not all powerful ambassadors wanted more people.
                    Indeed, some ambassadors prided themselves on having fewer people. I remember
                    John Tuthill, I have forgotten what year this was, but I think it was a year he
                    went to Brazil.</p>

                    more than we needed. So, not all the high powered people were grasping for more.
                    It was interesting that way.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ROOT: In budget terms this came up really in only two ways. One was to sort out
                    positions either in terms we got ten more positions in the budget this year;
                    where are they going to go? Because we probably had asked for 40 and couldn't
                    meet all 40 demands. Or maybe the reverse, you had money for only ten fewer than
                    you had, and who was going to get cut? If it was the latter, the easiest way to
                    cut is by attrition, so you wait for vacancies to occur, and then you just don't
                    fill them, which is not a very wise way to proceed, but it is the easy way. The
                    other budget issue is for expenses other than personnel. What happens there is
                    that imaginative administrative officers in the embassies will come in with
                    requests for their allotments to be increased substantially in order to meet
                    this or that need. There wouldn't be enough money for this, but about three
                    weeks before the end of the fiscal year, you discover that some allotments are
                    not being spent, so you pull them back. The name of the game in the budget was
                    to get this money out to where it could productively be spent, which wasn't
                    always, you know, how productive was it. Sometimes it looked like any way you
                    could get it spent so you wouldn't have to give it back to the treasury. I am
                    afraid sometimes it was more that.</p>

                    that had been fixed. But it is quite amazing that as late as '52 State

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well I had an open mind. It is an interesting question because in '59 I was
                    assigned to Copenhagen as economics officer. The buildup to that was
                    fascinating. Art Stevens, who was the executive director, was an adventuresome
                    type. He loved to go to exotic places and do imaginative things. Being executive
                    director, he was forever being importuned to by persons wanting a particular
                    position. He told his staff of one of his reactions. He had just been pressured
                    by someone who wanted to go to Copenhagen. He said, he couldn't imagine why
                    anyone would want to go to Copenhagen. It would be like swimming in whipped
                    cream. In '59 the personnel office had me tentatively assigned to about 15
                    places. For one reason or another they all fell apart. It was fascinating
                    because I was doing research on all these 15 places, living vicariously all over
                    the world. Finally they called me up and said, “We think now we really have an
                    assignment for you. It is in Copenhagen.” Just having heard the whipped cream
                    story I had the following conversation with my personnel officer. “Let's get
                    this straight. You have asked me if I want to go to Copenhagen, right?” “That's
                    right.” “I didn't ask you if I could go to Copenhagen did I?” “No, you didn't.”
                    “In that case I would be delighted.” As for the economic assignment, I think
                    this was part of the department's policy to provide officers with
                    diversification in their experience. It was a little amusing because economics
                    101 at the Columbia School of International Affairs was the only course I had to
                    take twice. Anyhow, such an assignment to a small embassy like Copenhagen was
                    ideal because the economic section was so small that even a junior economic
                    officer gets into everything. I should tell you what happened when I arrived.
                    The first thing one does on arrival at a post is to pay one's respects to the
                    ambassador. Val Peterson, a political appointee, ex-governor of Nebraska,
                    ex-civil defense chief, was ambassador in Copenhagen then. He greeted me with,
                    “So you are the new economics officer.” “That is correct.” “Well what is
                    economics anyway?” I wasn't quite prepared for this, but I decided it was a
                    serious question and it needed a serious answer. I took a few moments to collect
                    my thoughts. Before I could said anything it turned out it was really a
                    rhetorical question. He said, “I'll tell you. Everything is economics.” There
                    was a pregnant pause. “Until it becomes important, and then it is politics.” I
                    interpreted this to be his way of telling me not to be surprised if the
                    political section takes over something you have been working on because it has
                    become a hot potato. Sure enough that happened, but there wee so many
                    fascinating issues that they couldn't handle everything anyway. For that reason,
                    among many others, it was a wonderful place to be.</p>

                    important than this denigration would suggest, because they do have a vote in
                    various international fora. From the perspective of an economic officer we got
                    involved in such things as the chicken war. We wanted to sell chickens, and they
                    wanted to raise their own chickens.</p>
                <p>Q: These were the frozen chickens.</p>
                <p>ROOT: That sort of thing. This wasn't entirely an easy argument for us to make
                    because the American grain exporters loved exporting American grain to the
                    Danish chicken growers, but the American chicken exporters wanted to export the
                    chickens instead of the grain, and so it goes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well the chicken war was the major opening gun of the

                <p>ROOT: Yes. Indeed sometimes we were asked to make end use checks to see if
                    something on the strategic list that had been sent to a Danish importer from the
                    States was being used where it was supposed to be used. This got very dicey
                    because the local authorities didn't particularly like American officials
                    delving into private enterprise in Denmark. So we attempted to work in tandem
                    with the local authorities. That was the kind of issue we ran into.</p>

                    products for U.S. forces in Germany. As a matter of fact, the State Department
                    American personnel in Denmark were only about 10 or 15% of the total official
                    U.S. government personnel in Denmark. There were all kinds of hangers-on
                    including the veterinarian detachment from the army who was making sure that the
                    Danish products passed inspections before they went to Germany. We had a coast

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Oh, yes. We did quite a bit of traveling within Denmark. One of the
                    fascinating things about language was the closer you got to the German border,
                    the more Danish sounded like German. The closer you got to the Swedish border,
                    it sounded like Swedish. The closer you got to England, it sounded like English.
                    Of course it wasn't, but there were these accents that you saw. Also the Danes,
                    of course, knew how close their language was to German, but they didn't like to
                    be reminded of it. If an American would refer to the capital city of Denmark as
                    Copenhaagen, they would say oh now it is Copenhagen (long a). Of course they
                    don't say either. They say Kobenhavn they swallow it. Copenhaagen is very close
                    to the German Kopenhague; whereas the English usually give it the long a for
                    Copenhagen. These are the things that you learned that were sensitivities- you

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: They were delightful. In fact it is awfully hard to find anything
                    pejorative or negative to say about an experience in a lovely place like
                    Denmark. You could complain about the weather, but the people were really
                    friendly. They would often remind you how small the country was. In other words
                    don't expect us to pull your chestnuts out of the fire. Perhaps that is a way of
                    saying don't expect us to increase our share of the burden, which was one of the
                    favorite topics in those days. The Americans wanted the Europeans to spend more
                    on defense, that sort of thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much cooperation among the Scandinavian
                        countries, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, one of the more interesting negotiations that took place while I was
                    there was civil aviation. It was a Scandinavian group, not just a Danish group,
                    the SAS, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. There were two fascinating aspects of
                    that. One was the language they used to communicate among themselves. When they
                    had their delegation meeting, they did not speak Danish or Norwegian or Swedish.
                    They spoke English amongst themselves. But the other aspect had to do with a
                    debate over a rather esoteric point having to do with fourth freedom. In other
                    words can a U.S. airline carry passengers from Denmark to Germany. There was
                    great debate over the words. We were using an English text of the bilateral
                    agreement. Having invested quite a bit of effort in trying to learn the Danish
                    language, I got out the Danish version of the same agreement. The Danish version
                    supported the American position much better than the English version did. I made
                    this point, and they didn't appreciate that. But it sort of made the study of
                    the language all worthwhile.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Finns part of any Scandinavian activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, they were not part of SAS. Finnair is separate, not part of SAS. So
                    in that sense, no. There were Scandinavian efforts at sometimes divorcing
                    themselves from unpopular political aspects that the Americans or perhaps the
                    rest of Europe were pushing, but these never got very far. Of course, the
                    Norwegians are rather independent minded, but at the end of the day they would
                    cooperate in whatever the issue is.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, in my own reaction to the American political scene, I, like millions
                    of others was fascinated by this new young face and the great spirit that he
                    brought with him. As to whether it made a difference to the Danes, I think they
                    too on that level were fascinated by the Kennedy phenomenon. It wasn't so much
                    that they were unhappy with Ike, but Ike was kind of hands off. He let the
                    establishment run with it. Whereas, Kennedy was very much hands on. Not that we
                    felt it way out in Copenhagen very much, but the vibrations were felt.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about living in Denmark? I am told that the Danes in a
                        way delightful people, they are a really hard people to get to know. Did you
                        find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. As for living in Denmark, the first problem we faced was finding a
                    place to live. There was practically nothing available for rent that was within
                    our quarters allowance. We had by that time, a family of four kids. We were
                    staying in a hotel for week after week. Finally, just to see what the inside of
                    a Danish house looked like, we followed up on some for sale ads. The inevitable
                    happened. We found a house that was just what we wanted. We bought it. This is
                    most unusual for the foreign service. We were advised strongly against it
                    because, when you are transferred out, you are forced to sell. As a matter of
                    fact four years later it had appreciated almost a hundred percent. It was by no
                    means a negative experience, but in this sense we found ourselves in a well
                    established neighborhood. We went out of our way to get to know our neighbors.
                    They responded courteously, with some surprise actually that we would approach
                    them this way. One of them explained it this way. He said, 'You know the people
                    on the other side of us. They came here 35 years ago. We know all about them,
                    what they do and what their children do. Of course we never talk to them.” The
                    explanation is Denmark is such a small country and so few families that if you
                    get too close socially pretty soon you are obligated socially to so many people.
                    Most Danes are either Hansens or Jensens or you know, that sort of thing. So
                    they keep their distance. This takes a physical form sometimes with a little
                    hedge around. Even in the cemetery there is a little hedge around the graves. It
                    is quite amazing. Yes, they do have that reputation and they know it, and they
                    jealously guard it.</p>

                        good figures, statistics, information, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Certainly compared with farther east, we would get a lot better information
                    than from a government that didn't want to cooperate. But the data were not
                    always reliable in the sense that they were not telling us what we wanted to
                    find out. Sometimes the data would be not forthcoming because negotiations in an
                    area such as aviation make us particularly want to know that data that would
                    support our position in such a negotiation. But other than that it was a pretty
                    open society. You could get data pretty easily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did landing rights play a big role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, the Danes were not happy with receiving nuclear powered ships. This
                    was a big issue for a long time. But as for aircraft, they were governed by
                    these bilateral aviation agreements. Landing rights for something not covered by
                    the agreement, that is something else again. Of course if it were an emergency,
                    then there are emergency rules. If it was a charter aircraft, then you have to
                    negotiate it, and if it was for military purposes you had to negotiate that too.
                    But we weren't in a shooting war in those years, so I didn't experience that
                    problem.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>ROOT: Greenland was one of those issues that became sufficiently important that
                    it was political. Nevertheless, there were some economic aspects that we
                    followed. One of our most pleasurable activities was folk dancing. We joined a
                    Danish folk dance group. One of the reasons it was pleasurable was that the
                    dancers, unlike most Danes, didn't speak English. So it gave us a chance to
                    practice our Danish. It is customary to change partners. After one such dance
                    the young lady looked at me, “Are you from Greenland?” in Danish. She thought I
                    must be from Greenland because my Danish was such that I couldn't possibly be
                    from Denmark. The only other part of the world where they speak Danish was
                    Greenland.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well there was a ferry between Denmark anWarnemunde in East Germany. There
                    were issues there as to whether that was an avenue or leakage for the East
                    Germans to escape, that sort of thing. The export control issues were mostly a
                    West German-East German issue. The West Germans were insistent on being dominant
                    in determining issues of trade with East Germany. There were no great issues
                    that arose because of East Germany, just these little side things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes there were. We often had visitors who it was our privilege to show
                    around. I remember one congressman came, and he wanted an appointment at
                    Phillips. I explained that Phillips was in the Netherlands, not in Denmark. “Oh,
                    no,” he said, “it is Denmark.” So we found him a Phillips in Denmark and took
                    him around. Of course, it was not the Phillips he wanted to see. Afterwards, he
                    said, “You were right.” Some times the interest was not as well informed as it
                    should be. But there was great interest in investments, particularly in shipping
                    and agriculture.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well there were three of us there from the State Department. All the rest
                    were military. It was a broadening experience. They had very good speakers. It
                    was just as good a program as the war college. The war college has a reputation
                    of getting top notch speakers. We got the same people. Not only that, but we had
                    a foreign trip at the end of the year. I didn't find the exercise about writing
                    a paper particularly enlightening. The idea was, in fact the directive was to
                    pick a subject about which you don't know anything so that you can learn
                    something about it. So I picked Chinese population about which I knew absolutely
                    nothing, and did a lot of research and wrote what I found on 3x5 cards. I had
                    hundreds of these cards and shuffled them until it made a coherent story. I gave
                    credit for each of the quotes. The response was: “We can't accept this; there is
                    none of your own work here.” I said, “Why do you want to know my opinion about a
                    subject about which I know nothing?” So I took it back and decided whaI could
                    accept as my own. What was even worse was the experience on computers. This was
                    the early days of computers, but they thought it was time we learned about
                    computers. The class was divided into groups called companies. Each company was
                    given so much capital and so much inventory. You set the price for your product
                    in each of the territories, how much money you were going to put into research
                    and development and how much into marketing, all those good things. The computer
                    was so slow that you didn't find out until next morning how well you did versus
                    the competition. It soon became apparent the higher the price you put on the
                    product, the better off you were doing. It struck me that this was rather anti
                    social and probably not very good from the standpoint of how the real world
                    works either. So I asked, “What is the value in the computer program for the
                    factor relating sales volume to price?” “Oh, we can't tell you that. It would
                    give you an untoward advantage, a competitive advantage.” So I waited until it
                    was over. By that time it was obvious that the highest price did better. Finally
                    they said, “We really didn't want to pressure IBM because they provided this for
                    free.” Although they gave me a lot of data from the software, they omitted the
                    one factor I had requested. By that time I knew pretty much what it was. I
                    thought that this was no way to teach how computers work. It would have been far
                    better if there was a preliminary seminar at which we would learn what the
                    software is going to do and how the market works. Then you go back and make your
                    decisions or, failing that, tell you at the end of the day what the computer was
                    doing to you. What it really did was give you the impression that the computer
                    knows better than you do.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: '64. One of the other two in the ICAF experience from the State Department
                    had been working in the office of East West Trade. While we were still in ICAF
                    he learned that the State man and the Commerce man at COCOM had done the
                    unforgivable. They had revealed the agency differences in an international
                    meeting before all the other foreign delegations. So they were both relieved of
                    their duties. This meant that there was a vacancy in the office of East West
                    Trade. The chap who had come from that office thought I might enjoy it. So I
                    inquired if the position was available. It was. The personnel office said you
                    don't want to work there, noting that export controls was an obsolete topic. The
                    personnel office proposed that I be assigned to Toronto as commercial officer,
                    explaining that U.S. companies did more business in that consular district than
                    in any other. I thought to myself that U.S. companies did not need much help
                    from a U.S. Government official to do business in Canada. Much later Canadian
                    officials told me that they really do need a knowledge of Canadian rules and
                    regulations, but I wasn't aware of it at the time. I decided to take the
                    East-West Trade job anyway, and I never regretted it. It seems that, whenever
                    there is a crisis anywhere in the world, sooner or later, it is usually sooner,
                    somebody thinks the thing to do is to impose a new export control, or sanction,
                    in order to set things to right. So that is where I ended up for several

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>ROOT: I was part of the East-West Trade office. I was concerned with representing
                    the government in COCOM, the allied organization to coordinate export
                    controls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now at that time, I was interviewing Victor Kolas
                        yesterday, and he was doing it in tariffs at some point. At that point it
                        was quite overt. Was this overt at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: This was overt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular aspect of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, just before I came, the Commerce man and the State man who had been
                    doing it before were relieved of their responsibilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this because they...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: They had shown the poor judgment of disagreeing with each other in the open
                    meeting. So by the time I came along, there really was no one else except
                    another chap from Commerce who was a technical expert. Although I had some
                    technical background, I wouldn't want to claim to be a technical expert in these
                    things. But he and I, strangely with very little assistance even from the
                    Defense Department, spent months in Paris at the COCOM List Review.</p>
                <p>Q: You know, having interviewed so many people on so many issues now, and would
                    you get into matters of trade, you end up with three camps. You have got the
                    Department of Defense, who just doesn't want to let anything go, you know, I
                    mean because everything erasers can be used somehow to further the Soviet cause
                    if they get into the wrong hands. Commerce would basically want us to open up
                    markets and sell, and then the State Department is in the middle trying to be a
                    little more liberal than the Defense Department, and you all have these assigned
                    roles. Was this a factor when you were there?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, of course, those elements were present. What you describe is somewhat
                    of an oversimplification. One found hard nosed people in Commerce and at State,
                    and soft nosed people at Defense. But nevertheless the institutional bias was
                    what you describe, and it is what you would expect. The Defense people were
                    there to make sure the exports didn't undercut our defenses. That was their job,
                    so you really couldn't fault them for it. It was the job of Commerce to
                    administer the controls fairly, and certainly to make sure they weren't
                    undermined. But, at the same time, if they didn't make too much sense
                    economically, they would not hesitate to point that out. State, as you point
                    out, was often in the middle. More recently it hasn't been so much in the
                    middle; it has turned somewhat to the right. But when I was there, we were
                    primarily concerned with smoothing relations with our allies, which was what the
                    State Department was all about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within the State Department, were you pretty well left to
                        your own devices or did you get much direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. My job was not typical at all. Most State jobs are not as operational
                    as this was, where you were actually putting together lists and reviewing cases.
                    As a result, it didn't quite fit the standard role of a State Department
                    officer. If there was an issue that couldn't be resolved at my level, it was
                    sometimes difficult to get the higher echelons to focus on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been so many of things you were trying to
                        get cleared. For example, you wouldn't know what a gas turbine did. Probably
                        the person at the Department of Defense wouldn't be that familiar with a gas
                        turbine. There is such a technical overlay on every decision you made.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: There is a technical overlay. As you point out, government officials seldom
                    have the technical knowledge in depth necessary to really understand what that
                    gas turbine was all about, but the issues often narrowed in on a particular
                    commodity for a particular destination. You heard the expert opinions, over and
                    over again sometimes, so even the non-expert pretty soon had a pretty good
                    understanding of what the issue was. Even though we perhaps didn't know how the
                    gas turbine worked, we knew that the issue was its military use, and perhaps the
                    other side hadn't achieved that technology. That was the other thing learned. I
                    found it quite surprising that it didn't take a great deal of research to know
                    at least as much as the persons on the other side of the table, which was just
                    as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you are saying that part of your function was to
                        keep the allies all together. We are talking about NATO at this point and
                        Japan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Japan, yes.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know when you look at this, the roles particularly of
                        such countries as Sweden and Argentina were important. I would think we
                        weren't in any position to stop them from getting any of these things were
                        we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well not in a formal sense. They were not members of the organization, but
                    we often leaned on them anyway, and they often were suppliers to our Defense
                    Department who didn't want to ruffle feathers unduly, so there was a degree of
                    cooperation which was much more than one would have expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, you went back and forth to Geneva and Paris. Can
                        you think of any issues that really got everybody worked up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, yes, to Paris but not to Geneva. Communications and computers got
                    things worked up. Those weren't the only ones. Machine tools also got people
                    worked up. But the most controversial items were communications equipment and
                    computers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these controls instigated by orders from the Soviet
                        Union or from one of its bloc countries, or were we trying to think ahead of
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well naturally we wanted to think ahead of the order. If the order had
                    already been placed before the controls were imposed, you were two steps behind
                    already. The issue, frankly, on those two particular areas was that clearly they
                    had military significance, but clearly they had broad civil applications as
                    well. The debate often focused on how far had the Soviets gone technologically
                    in these areas. If we removed controls all together, what would be the effect,
                    and of course the intelligence people had input to this. Foreign availability
                    became part of the equation as to whether an item would be controlled or not. No
                    matter how you approach the subject, it was controversial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that other countries, say France or Germany,
                        were getting a march on us or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That did come up from time to time. Some of the U.S. manufacturers were not
                    solely concerned with developing the market. For instance, IBM was very much
                    concerned with its reputation as being conscientious of national security. They
                    within their own company were more restrictive with exports to the Soviet Union
                    than the government controls for many years. So it was never quite as simple as
                    it looked.</p>
                <p>Q: I would imagine. Well I mean this complexity, how long were you doing
                    this?</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well, I started in '64, and I stayed there five years. Then I came back to
                    it in '76 and stayed seven more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, '64 to '69. Were you considered Mr. sanctions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: The word “sanctions” wasn't used as freely as it is today. COCOM was the
                    buzzword, and I was sometimes known as Mr. COCOM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get manufacturers or congressmen with
                        manufacturers in their districts coming to you and saying hey come on, these
                        are American jobs we are talking about.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, although the congressman would more likely be saying hey look, the
                    Defense Department has a point, and we can't be selling the crown jewels to the
                    enemy. Occasionally an exporter would mobilize support form the hill, but the
                    congressman had to be wary of his flanks and not be too soft on security.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you are talking about computers and communications,
                        and of course developments in those fields were exploding and continue to
                        explode today. It is continually changing and getting more sophisticated and
                        more flexible and all that, and the revolution was beginning by that point
                        wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. We got ahead of the curve on computers by putting computers, full
                    stop, on the control list in the early 60's, before there was a real market for
                    them, because the Defense Department could of course, see what the potential
                    was, as did others for that matter. But as you point out, the technology
                    developed quickly, as did commercial as well as military applications. At some
                    point, an item took on what was known as a commodity status. It was on the
                    shelf. Anybody could get it. By the time it reached commodity status, there
                    wasn't much you could really do to stop it. This was true even in the 60's for
                    microprocessors. It was interesting. Integrated circuits were being developed
                    along with computers, and the item on the list banned any equipment using such
                    circuits. Well, this was the early days of micro electronics. Finally it got to
                    the point where there were so many pieces of equipment using integrated circuits
                    that the Commerce Department, without really getting formal clearance from
                    anybody, just had to remove that item from the control list. This was a
                    unilateral control at the time. This was almost unheard of. Nobody could really
                    fault them for it, because the control of such an item was impossible to
                    enforce.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Paris were you the front person in trying
                        to stop stuff from going back and forth? Were we trying to keep the French,
                        the British, the Germans and others from doing business? How did you see our
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: The United States was clearly the most restrictive in its policy toward
                    control. On the other hand the allies realized something had to be done. It was
                    a probing process. They would see that their particular product had a market and
                    they would like to sell it. But they didn't know whether the Americans would
                    stand for it or not. So they would come up with a proposal, and the Americans
                    would say, “No, we can't take that off the list because of these significant
                    strategic uses.” They would say, “Really? Show us.” Such a request was quite
                    understandable. Sometimes, even before it got to that point, the American
                    exporters would make the same points as the allies. In fact it was often much
                    more difficult to get a U.S. position which required agreement of the three
                    agencies at a minimum than it was to get 16 countries to agree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is often said true diplomacy is really waged in
                        Washington to get the various departments on the same line. It is certainly
                        much easier dealing with the nations abroad. Did the CIA play any role that
                        you were aware of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Oh, not only was I aware of the CIA role, but they attended our meetings.
                    Their representative would give us what they knew about the capability on the
                    other side with this particular technology or commodity. It wasn't anything
                    covert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, just the practical knowledge. Were there perceived
                        differences in outlook between the French, the Germans, and the British or
                        maybe the Dutch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, yes. A Dutch company, Phillips, for example, had a market in medical
                    electronics which the Dutch government tried to protect. To the extent this
                    could be defined without letting everything go through by calling it medical,
                    they were humored in that. The French were the most difficult to deal with,
                    because they often presented very complicated arguments which the rest of us
                    just didn't understand. Not only were there language differences, but the way
                    they approached these things was different. The Germans used to have Siemens at
                    their right hand and the British had their computer companies at their right
                    hand. We usually were not quite as up front about having U.S. companies there,
                    but they had their influence too.</p>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, it was clearly the United States trying to run herd, at least as they
                    saw it. We often were pretty heavy handed about it. This was resented even to
                    the point that the Belgians said, “This has gone too far. COCOM is supposed to
                    work on consensus. Everybody has to agree to an objection to a sale.” COCOM had
                    a rule of unanimity to add items to the list but it worked in reverse on
                    individual sales. All had to agree to sales and the United States often used its
                    veto to object to sales by other countries. But when the Belgian proposal
                    finally came to a vote, the Belgians got not support. Others realized that the
                    COCOM system would not work unless some country disciplined the organization and
                    no country other than the United States wanted to be the one to say “No.”</p>

                        phrase goes the 500 pound gorillas sitting at the table there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well of course we were trying to present something less than a 500 pound
                    gorilla. Nevertheless that was a pretty apt description.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Normally the alliances on a particular issue would be those countries which
                    shared a commercial interest in the item under consideration. Seldom would there
                    be much agreement with the United States to say, “No, you can't.” There would be
                    different combinations of countries pushing relaxation, because those who didn't

                    political capital on that item. You seldom had groups of countries opposing each
                    other. It was the United States that was the discipline for the
                    organization.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there ever any times when the United States wanted to
                        sell something and the others said no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: There were some times when pressures from U.S. industry were so great that
                    the U.S. Government felt it had to compromise, sometimes getting ahead of COCOM.
                    Whenever that happened, especially if we had previously said no to an export of
                    the same item by another COCOM member and then turned around and permitted a
                    U.S. export, there was all hell to pay. It was not accepted with pleasure.</p>

                <p>ROOT: The Japanese played their cards very close to the chest. They, of course,
                    had their own interests, but they seldom would come out until the end of the
                    negotiation to be definitive on precisely what they could accept and what they
                    couldn't. It was a little frustrating because they wouldn't commit themselves
                    until very late in the process. In other words they weren't going to use up
                    their political capital until it became evident that no other country was going
                    to accomplish their objective.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. The COCOM members had not given up sovereignty on anything. So, if the
                    organization, which usually meant the United States, told a country, “No, you
                    can't do this” and if that country felt it was important to their national
                    interest that they do it, they would say, “Sorry about that. In this particular
                    case we are just going to have to do it anyway.” This didn't happen very often
                    though.</p>

                        wasn't media attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Everything was done behind closed doors. When COCOM was first established,
                    even its existence was supposed to be secret. This was because of sensitivities
                    in France and Italy because of communist participation in their governments. Of
                    course the existence of the organization didn't remain secret more than a week
                    or two. The actual list was not made public until the British decided to publish
                    it. The organization never did; although the Wassenaar successor to COCOM now
                    publishes its lists on the Internet. During COCOM days, the British came to the
                    conclusion that industry had to know what it was. They didn't call it the COCOM
                    list, but everybody with a need to know knew that that was what it was.</p>
                <p>Q: When you were in Washington did you get pressure from the American embassy in
                    Paris or in London reporting requests from the foreign ministries of those
                    countries that the United States change its position on a COCOM case?</p>
                <p>ROOT: Yes, that sort of thing happened. Usually it was when the United States was
                    exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction. We insisted on controlling not only
                    exports from the United States but also re-exports. If we had said “No
                    objection” in COCOM and then denied a request for a re-export license for the
                    same case, that was not appreciated, to put it mildly. There were two different
                    U.S. bureaucracies involved. We finally had to work out an arrangement whereby
                    the re-export license requirement was waived if COCOM had approved it. That, to
                    this day, is still in the regulations, even though COCOM disappeared eight years
                    ago, and its successor doesn't have the same discipline.</p>

                        Switzerland, who were not in the system? They were obviously getting things
                        from all the COCOM members, maybe adding something, and then passing it
                        on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: The Swedish firm, Ericsson, was very much interested in exporting
                    communications equipment. Although Sweden was not a COCOM member, Ericsson
                    cooperated informally for two reasons. It did not wish to endanger its sales to
                    our Defense Department and it was dependent on U.S. sources for some of the
                    components in its equipment. Switzerland was a little different. They were
                    primarily interested in machine tools and because of their neutrality they
                    didn't want to become a member of such an organization. Nevertheless, they
                    entered into a confidential side agreement under which they would not increase
                    their exports to the East beyond historical levels. There was uncertainty as to
                    just what “historical levels” meant; but they did cooperate generally in this
                    way. After several decades the agreement became known publicly.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Israel seldom came under discussion. There was a fascinating book that came
                    out called Armageddon Network which was written by someone who overheard a chap
                    from the Defense Department who was very much hawkish on export controls talking
                    with Israeli intelligence people. The thrust of the book was that the particular
                    defense officials who were so negative on U.S. and allied exports were really
                    trying to protect the market for Israeli exports. I don't know if that can
                    really be supported, but the book made quite a fascinating case of it.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Naturally there was a lot of discussion in the hallways and at lunch, but
                    it was not much of a factor in the administration of export controls.</p>

                        that. Was this a part of the ambiance?</hi>

                <p>ROOT: Well yes. Of course they wouldn't consider it snitching. If they saw
                    something that was evidence that an allied country had sold something without
                    obtaining the required COCOM permission, then it could get a little dicey. Often
                    the evidence would be from a third country or perhaps it would be to the effect
                    that, within the family, the technology had developed to such a point that, even
                    though there were military applications, it couldn't be controlled anymore.</p>

                        exploration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That came later. There was a U.S. imposition of oil and gas equipment
                    controls which was supposed to be a flexible tool of foreign policy. You could
                    turn them off and on. But what actually happened, and this was in the '80s,
                    after the imposition of martial law in Poland, more or less at the instigation
                    of the Soviets, we cut down on oil and gas equipment which had a particular
                    impact on the west European's desire for a natural gas pipeline. Some of the
                    equipment came from the United States or had U.S. technology components in it.
                    Much of it was already in western Europe. But the controls which were supposed
                    to be a sanction against the Soviets turned out to be a sanction against our
                    allies, because in order to enforce the U.S. controls, we had to penalize the
                    European firms who were not abiding by those controls. This became a real
                    donnybrook. The State Department of course, as usual, was trying to smooth
                    things over, but it was practically impossible to smooth things over when they
                    are so obviously at loggerheads. Finally, President Reagan went farther than any
                    of us at State thought he would. He completely lifted them except if we could
                    negotiate something that COCOM would agree on. They obviously weren't going to
                    agree to control the equipment for the pipeline. The upshot of all this was
                    that, although my boss, who was new at the job, thought it was going to be
                    impossible to find anything that they could agree upon, we did eventually find
                    something. By that time I had worked this for so many years I knew we could find
                    something. There is always something out there, so we found geophones, which
                    listened for seismic vibrations indicating the presence of oil or gas. That
                    purpose did not meet the COCOM criteria; but geophones used the same technology
                    as hydrophones, which are used to listen to submarines. But the hard-liners in
                    Commerce, State, and Defense didn't want to give up the other controls. I
                    thought the President wasn't going to appreciate this, because of the potential
                    of putting him right back in the box he had just gotten himself out of. So I
                    resisted this quite strenuously within the EB bureau. I was told the White House
                    wanted it that way. I doubted that, but had no way to confirm my doubts. I
                    thereupon resigned in 1983 and went public with my concerns. The issue never did
                    go to the White House. The cabinet level in State and Commerce reversed their
                    underlings and unilateral U.S. controls were not put back in place.</p>

                        period, how effective at that time did you feel our controls were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, my personal opinion didn't count for much, but there was a CIA study
                    which concluded that controls on high priority micro electronic and semi
                    conductor manufacturing equipment had some effect. In a public document the CIA
                    said, in effect, “You know, they have been able to import enough equipment to
                    make all the micro electronic and semi conductor manufacturing equipment that
                    they need for military purposes; but it has cost them more because of these
                    controls and slowed them down. And they didn't get technical help in learning
                    how to use the equipment.” So it was a mixed bag.</p>

                <p>ROOT: I was with a joint State-AID outfit in Saigon dealing with transportation
                    and communications infrastructure, most of which was developed by the U.S.
                    military.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well it was very artificial structure. We were pretending we were really in
                    control, and it turned out we weren't. The usual political machinations showed
                    up in things like rice. We wanted to sell them rice, although they had their own
                    production capability. I wasn't concerned with that. I was, as I say, in the
                    transportation and communication side. There it was a reasonably constructive
                    role we were expected to play. The objective was to help the Vietnamese
                    understand what they could reasonably maintain after we left. It would have
                    taken their entire national budget just to maintain some of the roads we built.
                    Roads and communications equipment were not easy to maintain. In that sense I
                    think we made considerable progress, although it turned out, of course, that we
                    were talking to the wrong people.</p>

                    including those in which my own children participated. That was not so unusual.
                    I discovered that virtually everybody I dealt with on the U.S. side in Vietnam
                    was as disturbed as I was. We didn't seem to quite know what we were doing or
                    what was feasible and what wasn't. Finally the incursion into Cambodia took

                <p>ROOT: Yes. I was so disturbed that the next morning when we had our usual staff
                    meeting, and we were still talking about rice and balance or payments, I piped
                    up and said, “I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems that maybe we
                    ought to have some discussion about what happened yesterday.” One of my
                    colleagues said, “There goes Root with his Nuremberg defense,” which wasn't
                    exactly my idea. Eventually I did write a dissent about what we were up to in
                    Vietnam, and I was amazed when I got back to Washington to learn that I was the
                    only one in Vietnam who wrote such a memo. I was amazed because the vast
                    majority of people I talked with every day felt the same way I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In essence what was your dissent based on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well of course it couldn't be based on a thorough knowledge of everything
                    going on, because I didn't have that knowledge. But I did feel that I knew
                    enough to at least indicate my concern. It was quite a fascinating experience.
                    There were two options. One could either send it directly to Washington without
                    stopping anywhere in between, or you could go through channels. I opted to go
                    through channels, because I didn't particularly want to keep it secret. I wanted
                    to see how it would play. There was one chap in the political section who told
                    me that I just didn't know what was going on. Well I didn't pretend to know
                    everything that was going on, but I didn't think they knew either.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Most of my work had to do with interacting with the central government
                    people in these technical areas and with the U.S. military.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Yes. One of the aspects that really disturbed me was a proposal to build a
                    new airport for civil aviation use. It struck me that there were already so many
                    airports for military use that it boggled the mind to think that the Vietnamese
                    would need even more after we left. But the engineers could, of course, make an
                    engineering case that it would be nice to get this or that. I kept making
                    negative comments. This was not entirely appreciated. When it came time for my
                    efficiency rating to be prepared, the boss said that I was stubborn. I said,
                    “Would you mind changing that to persistent?” He said, “I'll change it to
                    persistent, but you are stubborn.” I thought that I should be stubborn on
                    something like that.</p>

                <p>ROOT: I was the economic counselor. It was a fascinating experience because it
                    was really three jobs: normal economic counselor, as in any post; interactions
                    with the British and French and occasionally with the Soviets on the occupation
                    responsibilities we still had; and struggling to cope with problems of access
                    between West Germany and West Berlin. There were four modes of transport - air,
                    water, rail, and highway: and the GDR made problems for all four.</p>

                <p>ROOT: We arrived just at the time the four power agreement was signed. This
                    resolved some of the issues we had with the Soviets. We left, of course, long
                    before the wall came down. During the time I was there it was a claustrophobic
                    atmosphere, being hemmed in. The German authorities in Berlin and the German
                    authorities in Bonn sometimes chafed at allied restrictions and oversight.
                    Naturally we had common interests, but not always the same emphases on what was
                    important.</p>

                        transportation, you were almost the keeper of what I would call the holy
                        bible. That is how far tailgates could be lowered. There was almost a
                        theology about dealing with Berlin. The main thing was, as I understand it,
                        any little relaxation of our insistence on our rights would be used by the
                        Soviets to ask for more, so we had to be very rigorous on this, or we felt
                        we did. Was that the case when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Oh, yes. Not quite as pronounced as you put it. Actually there seemed to me
                    to be opportunities for relaxing the restrictions on us that we weren't taking
                    advantage of. One of the restrictions was the 10,000 foot ceiling on the air
                    corridors. It was much more expensive if you had to fly that low. We had, of
                    course, through various stratagems, made a deal with the GDR without really
                    dealing with them if you know what I mean.</p>

                    occasionally. I thought I saw an opportunity to raise that ceiling, but I never
                    got anywhere with it.</p>

                    it that way. He was, that led him to want to provide impeccable service to
                    visitors from Washington. The irony of it was that there were so many of them he
                    couldn't do that for everybody. So, when a governor from an obscure southern
                    state came through with his wife, he let that one go. The most junior man on my
                    staff became control officer for Jimmy Carter and Rosalyn.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Pretty much, but there were some minor differences of opinion. The
                    occupation still continued but there were only a few things we were supposed to
                    do, such as munitions control.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Not entirely. As part of the four power agreement, the Soviets obtained
                    authority to open a commercial mission iWest Berlin. I was named as the U.S.
                    liaison for that mission, so this was something new. They didn't know quite what
                    to do, and I didn't know quite what to do, so we were feeling our way. It wasn't
                    as if everything had been worked out.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Well, yes, although it was heavily dependent on subsidies from Bonn. It was

                <p>Q: Was Berlin building up reserves so in case there was a shutdown, things could
                    go on at least for awhile?</p>
                <p>ROOT: Well there might have been some reserves as a heritage of the blockade,
                    which was long before we were there, but there was no great political push to
                    build them up. Things were relatively quiet I'd say.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Felix Bloch was a commercial officer on my staff. Several years later it
                    was alleged that he had passed secrets to the KGB.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when he was in Vienna I guess or Paris.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: It was in Paris. He had served in Vienna. Two members of the fourth estate
                    contacted me, one for newspaper reporter and one television reporter. They had
                    both figured out that I was his boss in West Berlin. So they asked me, “Was he a
                    spy?” I said, “No, not to my knowledge. His particular job as commercial officer
                    had less to do with the east than anything else in the Berlin mission. He later
                    went on, when he wasn't working for me, to the eastern affairs division which
                    did have reason to contact the East Germans. Both of these gentlemen called me a
                    second time six months later. Each had read a book which alleged that hundreds
                    of people, including Bloch, worked for the CIA. The reporters were sophisticated
                    enough not to take that at face value. So they asked me whether it was possible
                    that maybe he was working for the CIA and that the FBI and the CIA weren't
                    talking to each other. I said, “There are three kinds of people who work for the
                    CIA: the ones that make no bones about it and are completely open about it;
                    those whose cover is so thin that everybody knows but pretends they don't; and
                    others whose cover is so deep that nobody knows. He was not in either of the
                    first two categories. If he is in the third category, I would have no way of
                    knowing.” So I wasn't very much help to them. But what surprised me is that,
                    although these reporters contacted me, I was never asked this or any other
                    question by any one in the U.S. Government - the diplomatic security people at
                    State or the FBI or anyone else. He was denied his pension even though he was
                    never charged with, let alone convicted of, any criminal act. I have attempted
                    to help him get his pension restored.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is one of these things that is in limbo and is curious.
                        Allegations were made that are serious and seemed to be somewhat
                        substantiated. He didn't challenge them; he didn't confess, so nothing
                        happened except I guess he was discharged, and pension was taken away, and
                        he could have challenged that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: When he resigned in July of '90, he thought he was going to get his
                    pension. Then the Department took it away. He filed countless grievances and
                    then took it to the court. It is still not resolved.</p>

                <p>ROOT: We, of course, had our own CIA people. And the Eastern Affairs Division in
                    the mission in West Berlin was doing its best to figure out what was happening
                    in the GDR. These were normal activities. As for cloak and dagger stuff, there
                    probably was some of that going on, but not to my knowledge.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: As an example, there was an international commercial fair in Leipzig every
                    six months. Several of us in the U.S. mission managed to get to Leipzig for the
                    fair by a device where the Soviets issued us a separate piece of paper on which
                    the GDR had put its stamp so we could travel, but it wasn't in our passports.
                    Once we got to Leipzig, we could get a visa extension to go to other places. In
                    this way we managed to see some things going on in East Germany even though we
                    didn't recognize the GDR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we use the Leipzig fair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: This was an opportunity to see what eastern countries were producing. With
                    respect to my own job, we tried to determine whether eastern technology was up
                    to the level in the West. Amateurs like myself could only get an impression, but
                    at least we found out what was being exhibited. This is what one normally does
                    at a trade fair. The Leipzig fair was one of the biggest ones in the east. The
                    political side of the U.S. mission in West Berlin used the fair as an excuse to
                    get around the countryside and see what was going on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That was indeed the conventional wisdom. When Germany was eventually
                    united, however, it turned out that, compared to West Germany, they were eons
                    behind, so everything is relative.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: We might have been over estimating, but none of us thought they were up to
                    western standards. On the other hand, compared with Poland, Romania, Bulgaria,
                    and Hungary, they were relatively advanced.</p>

                <p>ROOT: We could drive on only the one autobahn that went to Helmstedt. Vienna, as
                    you know is south and east of Berlin, but to get there we had to travel west and
                    then much farther east. It was a very long detour; but nonetheless it could be
                    done. Or you could fly, or take a sealed train. You could not leave the train
                    while it was in the GDR. Those were the three methods of access for

                    these access questions. We would provide data that was more accessible in
                    Berlin, but we weren't the negotiating partners. We sometimes worked out local
                    issues with the Berlin authorities. There wasn't a need for extremely close
                    working relationship because it was pretty clearly defined who did what.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Then I went to the OES Bureau, to the other side of the street. This was
                    during the so-called detente period in the Nixon administration. Whenever he had
                    a summit meeting with the Soviets, they had to agree on something, and it
                    usually ended up being an agreement to cooperate in science and technology.
                    Somebody had to decide what it meant after the agreement was signed. It was our
                    bureau that managed the workings of these agreements. We find people who would
                    travel back and forth and decide what the projects were. It wasn't as if this
                    came form the bottom up. The grass roots had not insisted that we had to have
                    such agreements. It came from top down. Even so, it was fascinating, because
                    there were things that we could get together with the Soviets on
                    productively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things do you recall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: We of course, were particularly anxious to find things where they were
                    ahead of us, so it wasn't all a one way street. The conventional wisdom had it
                    that this was just a means whereby they could get for free some of our
                    technology. The export control restrictions were still in effect, so whatever we
                    did in these delegations could not involve transfer of technologies identified
                    on the export control list. A notable area in which they could help us was
                    metallurgy. They had developed various metallurgical processes that were ahead
                    of ours. So this was one of the more popular projects on the U.S. side. A few
                    years later in 1979, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, all this came to a
                    screeching halt. There were two commercial contracts that were pending at that
                    time. One had already been signed by U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel to construct a
                    steel mill at Novolipetsk. The other was an Alcoa deal to build an aluminum
                    smelter in Smolensk. The U.S. government immediately put a stop to both
                    contracts and tried to strengthen international export controls on metallurgy,
                    even though this was the one area where they were ahead of us. It was very
                    weird.</p>

                    real enthusiasm. Of course it was a wonderful travel experience. They learned a
                    lot. I am sure the Soviet and East Europeans were also eager. So there was a
                    vigor and an energy to the thing from these participants. But the program didn't
                    get a great deal of press play. It wasn't all that well known that this was
                    going on. Of course the agreements themselves got in the news because of the
                    President's involvement. There were still unreconstructed cold warriors who
                    worried about the technology going. But efforts to stop any technology transfer
                    were unsuccessful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: It was an office that had two parts which I called the yes part and the no
                    part. The no part was concerned with export controls. In the yes part we were
                    negotiating trade agreements with China, Hungary, and Romania just as if they
                    were normal countries until the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. After
                    that, there was no more business for the yes part and the no part expanded.
                    There were all these sanctions under the Carter Administration, the grain
                    embargo and all that. So the yes part became not simply more no but hell no,
                    because there was a great deal of political insistence that we punish the Soviet
                    Union economically.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, some things had in technical terms. For instance, computer controls
                    had to be relaxed. Integrated circuit controls had to be relaxed, as I mentioned

                <p>ROOT: Not only most integrated circuits but also most computers became shelf
                    items. It was impossible to control them, so computer speed limit and memory
                    size limit had to be progressively raised. But it was always way behind the
                    technical development. Technology was proceeding at a much faster rate than the
                    revisions of export controls.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Well prior to '79 it wasn't all that much different from the 60's, when I
                    was there before. The debate had moved to a different level of technology, but
                    we were still arguing about computers and communications.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Not particularly. It was my experience, and I was in the business through
                    many administrations both Republican and Democrat, that the change of
                    administration seldom meant much difference. There were certain individual
                    congressmen or senators or bureaucrats or agencies that could be pretty much be
                    depended upon to be either for or against the export control issue of the time.
                    But something like Afghanistan or detente had more of an effect than a change of
                    administration. Even detente didn't change the controls much. As I mentioned
                    earlier it was in the State Department one of these strange functions that
                    didn't have a parallel. Nobody paid a great deal of attention to it.</p>

                <p>ROOT: Not particularly. The big development in '76 was a report prepared by Fred
                    Bucy, CEO of Texas Instruments, to the effect that it was more important to
                    control microprocessor production technology than to control
                    microprocessors.</p>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ROOT: Yes. TI wanted to restrict the ability of its competitors to sell the
                    technology to manufacture products which TI wanted to sell. The Bucy report used
                    a security rather than a commercial argument. This security argument was written
                    into the '79 version of the Export Administration Act. This was the new
                    development, what do we do about technology to produce these things. There was
                    emphasis on that. The other side of the coin about removing controls on
                    microprocessors didn't move quite as fast as the addition of production
                    technology controls.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: They maintained the interest they had in the 60's. It certainly didn't
                    abate, but I wouldn't say it increased all that much. Some of their proposals
                    would reflect what they were then able to export, so to that extent you could
                    see that Japan's emergence as a major economic power was reflected. The way they
                    played export controls didn't change much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period the United States was regularizing its
                        relations with China. How did this affect export controls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: During and shortly after the Korean War, China was treated more
                    restrictively than the USSR, because China was a belligerent in that war. But
                    i1957 the British led COCOM to remove this adverse China differential. Of course
                    U.S. China relations did not start to thaw until 15 years later, in 1972. In the
                    80's when Reagan came on board, there was a desire to treat China more liberally
                    than the Soviets, i.e., to “play the China card,” as it was called. What the
                    Reagan administration people on high wanted to do was to make it clear that the
                    Chinese were going to be treated more favorably with respect to export controls.
                    The idea was to help to contain the Soviets. However, nothing happened. The
                    Defense Department continued to object to any exports to China having a military
                    potential. This went back and forth for months, I guess even years, with the
                    President getting more and more insistent to play the China card and nothing
                    happening. Finally senior State Department officials came to me and asked, “What
                    can we do?” I said, “It is simple. You make a list of items that you are willing
                    to sell to the Chinese but not to the Soviets and authorize Commerce to approve
                    exports of those items to China without any review by the Defense Department.
                    Top levels of the Defense Department were saluting the President and agreed that
                    there had to be a procedure to relieve their subordinates from the box they were
                    in. The regulations were revised in 1979 to permit shipping some items of
                    military significance to the Chinese military. The list of items that could go
                    to China and not to the Soviet Union was called the green line. Much later, when
                    the Soviet Union broke up, there was no more favorable treatment to China
                    compared with the Soviet Union. The green line list remained but it affected
                    very few cases. Technology had progressed in the intervening 12 years, so that
                    there wasn't much substance left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Afghan invasion by the Soviets in December of
                        '79, was there almost a complete shutdown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: There was an effort to shut down. The Defense Department came to Commerce
                    and said we should stop exporting in 10 militarily significant industrial
                    sectors. Commerce looked at these sectors and concluded that they covered
                    virtually the entire economy. But there was no consensus to impose a complete
                    embargo. So the ten industrial sectors were narrowed to just one, metallurgy.
                    This sector was selected, because of the cancellation of the steel mill and
                    aluminum smelter contracts. These contracts were canceled immediately after the
                    invasion because of a political imperative to take some clearly visible actions.
                    But metallurgy controls had little substance because oSoviet capabilities in
                    this field. In response to an urgent request to do more, I came up with a new
                    formula called “no exceptions.” Normally, items on the agreed control list
                    could, on an exceptional basis, be exported to the East if COCOM members agreed
                    to each such sale. Under “no exceptions” COCOM would not agree to any
                    exceptional exports to the Soviet Union. This policy lasted for years, almost
                    until the Soviet Union disappeared. I think it lasted until '87.</p>
                <p>Q: As things progressed past '79, the Reagan administration came in. This must
                    have at least initially been seen as, you know, a right wing government that was
                    really going to clamp down on things.</p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, some might have seen it that way. In fact what happened was that the
                    very first thing that Reagan did was to lift the grain embargo which Carter had
                    imposed. This didn't have much to do with COCOM, which controlled only strategic
                    technology, but it was a straw in the wind. It indicated that Reagan was not
                    going to be tougher than Carter. In fact he was going to be more relaxed in some
                    respects than Carter, which probably most people didn't appreciate at the time,
                    but that is what actually was happening.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>ROOT: It started out with Sam Huntington, an advisor from Harvard. In the early
                    1970's, he advocated controls on the export of oil and gas equipment as a
                    flexible tool of foreign policy. Of course we were leaders in the field and the
                    Soviets were eager recipients of this technology. They had a lot of oil and gas
                    they wanted to extract using the best available technology. Interestingly, none
                    of the agencies, not even the Defense Department, supported the idea at that
                    time. Indeed, one of the detente agreements involved cooperation in oil and gas
                    technology. During a hearing, a Congressman asked me how we could possibly
                    justify helping the Soviets develop oil and gas for their military
                    establishment. I responded that the Soviets were producing much more oil and gas
                    than their military could possibly consume. They were net exporters of oil and
                    gas. The Congressman didn't realize this. But he was very much aware of problems
                    in obtaining oil from the Middle East, including a 1973 embargo and subsequent
                    price increases. He said, “I would deal with the devil himself under those
                    circumstances.” That was still the attitude even in the Defense Department when
                    Huntington first made his proposal. Huntington was almost all by himself at that
                    point. But he eventually prevailed. The next time there was a crisis with the
                    Soviets, the White House over ruled all of us at the working level and directed
                    that these controls go into effect. It was a very inflexible tool when the
                    controls were invoked to try to stop Western Europeans from using U.S. equipment
                    and technology to help the USSR build a pipeline to deliver natural gas to the
                    West. The U.S. objective was to show displeasure because of Soviet pressure on
                    Poland to impose martial law in response to Solidarity activity.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That was the issue where Huntington finally prevailed. But even then, those
                    at the working level in all three departments (State, Commerce, and Defense)
                    were very skeptical about it. Then it turned into this brouhaha with the allies
                    about the pipeline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well by this time were you seeing these various tools as
                        having much effect. In other words, you know, did this make sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: It had a tremendous unintended effect in the pipeline case. It made no
                    sense as I saw it. The pipeline was going forward with this equipment because
                    the western Europeans did not respect our unilateral controls. The Soviets must
                    have been laughing at us. It was a complete disaster as far as I could tell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem; there was nobody to say boy this
                        sure isn't working or something like that.</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ROOT: It was obvious it wasn't working. It finally got to the point where the
                    President couldn't look the other way. You know Reagan had a reputation of not
                    being all that sophisticated in matters of this sort. Maybe that is just as
                    well., I mean he apparently concluded that, if it was not working, we should
                    undo it. So there you have it.</p>
                <p>Q: It got to a certain point to say how did this come up with you showing your
                    stubbornness I guess.</p>
                <p>ROOT: We had to enforce the rules. Commerce was enforcing its rules but State is
                    part of the government and these were government rules. We couldn't ignore them,
                    and they were put in effect by usual government procedures. So when the British
                    and French and Germans and Italians were all ignoring our entreaties and
                    proceeding in violation of our rules, the State Department couldn't say no, you
                    can't do this when Commerce said we have to deny them export privileges or
                    whatever the enforcement was. It got more and more- (end of tape)</p>
                <p>It became obvious that part of the way, part of the procedure to get us out of
                    the untenable position was to change the rules. There wasn't any way short of
                    that that would work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this going all the way back, was there sort of a
                        secondary punishment? In other words, did we punish American firms whose
                        equipment or technology was being used contrary to our controls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: If the American firm was exporting without a license they were in trouble,
                    assuming that a license was clearly required. Sometimes that was in debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the American firm might have supplied a British firm
                        under an approved license and later the British firm might have included
                        these U.S. components in something sent to the USSR because the British
                        government did not share the U.S. government view that such an export should
                        not take place. Would the American firm suffer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: If the American firm was in collusion with the British decision it could
                    suffer, but in most cases the British would have enough sense not to involve
                    them with collusion if they didn't want to unnecessarily get the American firm
                    into trouble. Sometimes the American firm would get into PR trouble. For
                    example, during the apartheid days, Firestone was embarrassed by a picture
                    showing Firestone tires on a South African police car. But American companies do
                    not get into legal trouble if they follow U.S. rules and are not complicit in
                    another party's violation of those rules.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: There were lots of sanctions involving other countries. South Africa was
                    one example. There had been lots of sanctions for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This raises a question. Here you are sitting in the middle
                        of this web of sanctions. It seems to be a very easy tool for Congress or
                        somebody if they are concerned about a country to whip out these sanctions.
                        Were we in the State Department trying to stop this because sanctions are
                        not very effective and just hurt American firms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: In reaction to Afghanistan for instance, it was obvious there was going to
                    be a problem with the grain embargo. This no doubt was mentioned, however that
                    was imposed practically within 24 hours from on high, I mean from the White
                    House. The departments had little left to do except salute and try to implement
                    it. That is usually the way these things work. There is a crisis which demands
                    immediate action. You can't send in the marines for obvious reasons, and
                    jawboning isn't enough, so they start talking about sanctions within 24 hours
                    almost invariably. It is usually not a question of congressional mandate; that
                    often comes later. The Cuban embargo was strictly executive action, although
                    years later the Congress decided to legislate it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: My office was deeply involved with reviews and reports on South African
                    cases. Commerce administered license procedures and the South African desk
                    weighed in on the political ramifications. My office was the liaison with
                    Commerce. So we tried to reconcile differing opinions held by Commerce and the
                    South African desk. There were lots of details to work out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: They would not want things to go to military or police entities. Then the
                    question would arise what is a military or police entity? So you would have to
                    go back and define it. We were involved in that kind of detail.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting information from INR or CIA as to the
                        final disposition of U.S. exports to South Africa. For example, if a U.S.
                        company got an order from XYZ company in South Africa for raincoats. How did
                        you know that those raincoats weren't going to end up in the hands of South
                        African policemen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: If the XYZ company was a subsidiary of a military or police entity and it
                    was on the list, then that was definitive. If it wasn't, then the raincoats
                    would not be picked up. I must say that the government did a better job in
                    regularizing and defining such matters for the South African controls than for
                    controls affecting other countries. For example, exporters are given no guidance
                    in interpreting rules permitting exports to civil but not to military end-uses
                    or end-users in other countries. So the exporter must make his own judgment as
                    to whether a transaction is civil or military. These are left over cold war
                    controls and apply to the eastern countries. There were such intense pressures
                    both for and against exporting to South Africa that the government had to define
                    what was military or police.</p>
                <p>Q: I would imagine that you would be besieged by persons complaining about every
                    decision you made, or opinion you advanced, regarding South Africa. In
                    particular, those who wanted a complete embargo must have been unhappy with any
                    liberal decision or opinion.</p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, of course those that wanted s complete embargo never got it. So it
                    was easy to defend liberalization for something that had not been identified for
                    selective controls short of a complete embargo. There still was debate of
                    course. Sometimes the argument would be that a particular firm was either on, or
                    omitted from, a list by mistake. Such lists turn out to be living documents.</p>

                        There was almost a complete embargo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Relatively simple although whenever there was a new reason to get angry
                    with Cuba, somebody wants to tighten the sanctions even though there was not
                    much left to tighten. So maybe you cut off all tourism. There were always a few
                    things that were left hanging.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the basic issue that caused you to resign?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>ROOT: Well there were two issues. One was the pipeline as I mentioned. I felt
                    that I was in an impossible position being asked to collaborate in the
                    imposition of unilateral controls which would put us right back in the pipeline
                    imbroglio. The other issue had to do with computers, and this was a COCOM issue.
                    The pipeline wasn't. The computer controls were hopelessly out of date. They had
                    a speed limit and a memory size limit that were by that time almost ten years
                    out of date and completely unenforceable. The basis for updating the computer
                    controls was pretty apparent. When they were put into effect, those were the
                    only two parameters of concern. Since then other bases for control had been
                    developed, such as fault tolerance and micro-programmability. So the rational
                    basis for updating the controls was to tighten them by adding these new
                    parameters and to relax them by raising the limits for the old parameters. It
                    wasn't that you wanted to relax the speed and the memory size. After ten years
                    they couldn't possibly be controlled at those limits. Well, in '81 we were about
                    ready to do this, and the Defense Department was adamantly opposed about
                    relaxing anything. Bill Perry was over there at the time at a very high
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later Secretary of Defense, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well, he was a deputy at the time. I had the opportunity to ask him, “Would
                    you prefer to keep things the way they are without strengthening in these new
                    gimmicks, or is it important enough to get the new gimmicks on the list to
                    compromise on the speed and memory size?” He said, “Given the political
                    situation now, better just to leave it the way it is.” I could accept that, but
                    two years later Perry was no longer in that job, and I had access only to the
                    next level down. They said, “It is unacceptable to relax the speed and memory
                    size. But it is also unacceptable not to get the new parameters added to the
                    list.” In other words, they were insisting on something that was totally
                    impossible to negotiate. They had led me down this garden path. They had
                    provided no such guidance for the two years we were negotiating this in COCOM.
                    When you are negotiating the details, you put unresolved issues in brackets and
                    each delegation then goes back to its government to determine how it wishes to
                    proceed. This draft was the culmination of two more years of negotiating
                    following the two years which preceded the Perry decision. Defense didn't utter
                    a peep during the two years since the Perry decision in spite of our repeated
                    requests for comment. It finally came to the point where we had to get a
                    definitive U.S. position. Since the Defense position was totally non-negotiable,
                    I decided that things had gotten to such an unsatisfactory state thaI couldn't
                    continue to carry out my responsibilities. There was no way it could be done.
                    There were other factors. My name was on as hit list which appeared in an
                    article by Richard Vigeurie in a magazine called Human Events. This was a list
                    of people in the government who the author thought should be removed from their
                    official responsibilities because they didn't have the proper attitude.</p>

                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>ROOT: High officials in the Reagan administration shared those views. William
                    McCormick was assistant secretary for EB at the time, courtesy of Jesse Helms.
                    He brought in a deputy assistant whose only function was to supervise my office.
                    I went to this chap and said, “Set's face up to it. There is no point in both of
                    us having the same job description. Do you want me to do anything, or are you
                    going to take it over?” Well that was a little too much for him to take, but it
                    was obvious they were trying to get me out. There were big names on that list,
                    like Alexander Haig, so I was hardly alone. But, by that time, Haig had already
                    been pushed out, as had several others. So it was not just substantive issues
                    which pushed me to resign. If it hadn't been this, they would have found
                    something else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROOT: As I mentioned earlier, the Secretaries of State and Commerce reversed the
                    proposals of their assistants to reimpose unilateral oil and gas equipment
                    controls. A year after I resigned, COCOM adopted the computer compromise I had
                    negotiated. At the time of my resignation I wrote an open letter to the
                    President and provided copies to those who should have had an interest. It got
                    some press play. I was very pleased with what the Post reporter, Stuart
                    Auerbach, did. But I was utterly amazed at the irresponsibility of the New York
                    Times reporter, Clyde Farnsworth. He was irate that I would not give him the
                    exclusive story; but I could not do that, because I had already talked to
                    Auerbach. He then wrote a story which was entirely contrary to my position. He
                    didn't even have the courtesy to put his own name to the article. He put
                    somebody else's name on it. I wrote to the Times complaining but they paid no
                    attention to that. I just couldn't quite believe what was happening.</p>

                <p>ROOT: I was asked by a number of private groups to speak as to what was going on
                    here. I was also asked by Senator Nunn to appear before his committee as to why
                    I had left. This was the next spring. The government, of course, would have
                    nothing to do with me for a number of years, but shortly after I left a new
                    industry organization known as the Industry Coalition of Technology Transfer, or
                    ICOTT. What prompted the formation of ICOTT was the plan of the government to
                    impose controls on west-west technology transfers. This plan was inspired by the
                    Bucy report. It would have greatly complicated the activities of multinational
                    corporations with subsidiaries or branches in other western countries. ICOTT was
                    very much interested in having my participation in their group. So I have
                    maintained my collaboration with ICOTT for the past 20 years. The present
                    members have forgotten why it was established. By about '85 or '86, the
                    government had forgotten why I had resigned, and so I became a member of a
                    technical advisory committee advising the government on export control
                    regulations and procedures. I have also been doing this for about 20 years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you noticed any change in the use of sanctions and
                        their effectiveness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: Well of course, I was fascinated by the political debate in Congress at the
                    time of Desert Storm when the Democrats said, “Well, not so fast, let's give
                    sanctions a chance to see if we can get Iraq out of Kuwait without using
                    military force.” This military force was eventually approved in Congress by a
                    very split vote. Many Democrats were still pushing for sanctions. The
                    conventional wisdom has it that the sanctions would not have worked. Look at
                    what has happened since. We have kept the sanctions in place. They had no effect
                    on Saddam Hussein. I don't know whether that is definitive evidence or not.
                    Saddam Hussein did offer to withdraw from Kuwait before we had fired a shot; but
                    we did not put that offer to the test. Sanctions have been used as a major part
                    of U.S. reaction to just about every crisis, both before and after I resigned.
                    The effort to remove or relax Cuban controls has gotten nowhere. The North
                    Korean embargo lasted from the Korean War of course, 1950 up until the big deal
                    about the light water reactor in the mid '90s. But even after that deal, which
                    promised that we would remove our embargo, it took two or three years before it
                    was done. It was done very grudgingly, lots of items previously uncontrolled
                    except to embargoed countries were added to the list just for exports to North
                    Korea. So it certainly has not been a period when the concept of sanctions has
                    gone away.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find yourself being used as the person who talks
                        for sanctions or against sanctions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: There are maybe some who would like to use me either for or against. My own
                    position is that sanctions are often ineffective in accomplishing or furthering
                    their stated purpose. On the other hand, sometimes they are effective in keeping
                    us from doing something that would be worse. Sometimes the military option would
                    have gotten us into deep trouble, and the sanction trouble is not quite that
                    deep. Sanctions are not entirely negative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is the American thing, “Don't just stand there; do
                        something.” It is a hell of a lot better to sanction than to fire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROOT: That's right. I have been amazed that sanctions weren't used in the Kosovo
                    situation more than they were. The oil embargo was pretty effective on overland
                    routes, but oil was still coming into Yugoslavia by sea. Of course, not being in
                    the government, I no longer have any inside information. But I attend many
                    seminars and symposia and ask officials why didn't we stop the oil going in
                    before we started to bomb? I get fascinating answers. One was the French
                    wouldn't have stood for it. So I asked the French, and the French said the
                    Soviets wouldn't have stood for it. But I can't imagine that if we had put it to
                    the French and the Soviets that either you cooperate on the oil embargo or we
                    bomb, that they would have refused to cooperate. Then I asked General Nash who
                    was chief military man on the ground, and he said, “We should have stopped the
                    oil.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Bill, this has been a very fun conversation. I have
                        learned a lot more about sanctions, which are, of course, a major tool of
                        American diplomacy. Whether they should be or not, as you have said, is open
                        to question. It depends on the issue, but certainly...</hi>
