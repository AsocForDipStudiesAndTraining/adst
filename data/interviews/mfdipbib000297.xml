                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good afternoon. This is Jim Shea, and I am here in
                        Winchester, Virginia, interviewing my old friend and colleague of many, many
                        years, John Doherty. Both of us have spent some years in Argentina. John,
                        why don't we start this way? Can you tell us a little about your labor
                        background and how you got into the labor attach� corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes. I worked at St. John's College at the International Labor Center
                    from 1955 until 1961, when I came into the Bureau of International Labor Affairs
                    in the Labor Department. I worked as a labor adviser in the Trade Union Programs
                    Division. From there I entered the State Department in 1965 and reported later
                    that year to Mexico City which was my first post, where I served two years as an
                    assistant labor attach�. Then I was off to Lima, Peru, where I served as labor
                    attach� for three years, then a four year stint in Argentina from 1969 to 1973,
                    and from there on to Brussels to the US Mission to the European Communities as
                    labor attach�. While there I also had responsibility for the European Parliament
                    and was there for three years before going off to the Senior Seminar at the
                    Foreign Service Institute. Coming out of the Senior Seminar, I went to Lisbon,
                    Portugal for two years, then came back and served briefly as Inter-American
                    advisor over at the Labor Department and later as Special Assistant to the
                    Deputy Under Secretary of Labor. I retired in December 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, prior to your experience at St. Johns, weren't you
                        in Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, I actually started working in international affairs in 1952. At
                    that time I was Vice President of the Maryland state Letter Carriers Union. You
                    will recall that my father was the National President of the Letter Carriers
                    Union. I had been a letter carrier in Bethesda, Maryland, and had been active in
                    the local union. I was the editor of the paper, had been a local union officer,
                    and then legislative representative and Vice President for the Maryland state
                    Letter Carriers Union. From there I started traveling in 1952 with Italian
                    groups as a project manager in 1952 for the old Mutual Security Agency. In 1954
                    I went to Bard College to their education center and then a few months later we
                    transferred to St. John's College. It was from there that I went to the OEEC in
                    Paris. I was with the European Productivity Agency at the OEEC. There were three
                    representatives from the American Federation of Labor and three from the CIO. I
                    was an AFL representative along with Tom Byrne, subsequently of the Teamsters
                    and later on ambassador, and George Allen, who was from the Building Service
                    Employees International Union. The three CIO representatives were Woodie
                    Ginsberg from the Automobile Workers, Oliver Singleton from the Baltimore CIO,
                    and Shorty Phelps from the Oil Workers. Q: John, did you get any training before
                    you went off to your first post in Mexico, and did they give you any Spanish
                    [language training] at the Foreign Service Institute?</p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, while I was with the Labor Department, I studied Spanish three
                    mornings a week at the Foreign Service Institute at 8:00 o'clock, so I had a
                    fairly good base. I went off to Mexico almost at a 3/3 [proficiency level]. Then
                    when I got to Mexico, I studied each morning there to perfect [my Spanish]. In
                    terms of other kinds of training, I think that having conducted workers
                    educational programs and having dealt so much with Latin American affairs both
                    at St. Johns and at the Labor Department, I was fairly well trained for the job
                    before I reported. That plus basic orientation at the State Department and I
                    think I was pretty well prepared when I got to Mexico City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The basic orientation was overall State Department
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, and it was conducted at the Foreign Service Institute. Also I took
                    a communications course there and then a program was arranged for me to visit
                    international representatives of the various trade unions headquartered in
                    Washington. I also visited various international organizations, for instance,
                    the OAS and with the Mexican Embassy and had quite a few discussions with people
                    familiar with Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: I was there less than two years. I forget the exact number of months.
                    Irving Salert was the labor attach�, and I was his assistant. I was anxious to
                    move on to my own post and let the assignment people in Washington know that I
                    was available for transfer if they had any openings. That's when I went off to
                    Lima, Peru.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of the Mexican Confederation of
                        Labor (CTM) and its Secretary General Fidel Velasquez?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, I guess my impressions of Fidel Velasquez are lasting because he's
                    lasting. (laughter) I understand he's still [in power]. This is 1991 and that
                    was 1965 and he was in control for many years before that. He was a very
                    powerful man and a very interesting man. Even though he struck fear in the
                    hearts of an awful lot of labor attach�s visiting from other countries, I found
                    him to be very open to discussions, and even though I was the assistant labor
                    attach�, I found it very easy to arrange meetings with him and to have talks
                    with him. I thought that he was quite a formidable political and labor leader
                    and that he was one of the real forces in the country. If you talked to Fidel
                    Velasquez, you had a fairly good idea of what the truth was about a
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always had the idea that the Mexican labor movement was
                        held back by rampant corruption. Would you care to comment on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, there was quite a bit of corruption in Mexico and you have probably
                    read that in recent years they actually put the head of the petroleum workers in
                    jail, which I never thought would happen. I think wherever you find unions that
                    are relatively advanced, particularly those that have been part of the ruling
                    party, such as the CTM has been with PRI since the 1920's, you are going to find
                    not only corruption, but you are going to find struggles for power and struggles
                    for money. We had an assistant at the Embassy, Pancho de Real, who was a very
                    interesting old fellow-He had been with Carranza during the revolution- and
                    whenever a Mexican labor leader would die he would feign grieving and wipe a
                    tear from his eye and say, “We have lost another millionaire.” And probably he
                    was right. (laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our Ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: It was Fulton Freeman, a wonderful man, who had a very good
                    understanding of the political situation in Mexico including the unions and the
                    trade union movement, the CTM, and Fidel Velasquez and how they all fit in.
                    Going back just a minute [to the issue of] corruption, I found subsequently that
                    in countries where the unions were not connected with a political party which
                    was dominant or in power, then corruption diminished or was much less, if it
                    existed at all. For example, the Peronists were very much a part of the Peronist
                    government, whereas in Peru, the APRISTAs never really came to power until
                    recent years, and therefore they didn't have money or power, and the opportunity
                    to become corrupt was accordingly diminished. You can carry it to an extreme. I
                    remember visiting the Sugar Workers Union in Orange Walk, Belize, an extremely
                    poor union, and of course the leaders themselves were poor. There was no money
                    to corrupt anyone. So I think a lot of corruption has to do with whether or not
                    the [union is] connected with the party in power or with a strong political
                    party and whether or not the unions themselves are well off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Mexico, John, did you see
                        representatives of the AFL-CIO fairly often? I'm thinking of people like
                        Serafino Romaldi, and Andy McClellan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, in fact they had representatives there. One of them was Jesse
                    Friedman, a dear friend of mine, who had worked with me at St. John's College
                    and was of course Serafino Romaldi's step-son. Jesse was headquartered in
                    Cuernavaca. He worked quite well with the ORIT and had very good relations with
                    the CTM as well, particularly with the CTM's education department. In Mexico
                    City itself from time to time we would have representatives of the American
                    labor movement who were actually working in the ORIT office. At the time I was
                    there, Joe Bermudez from the AIFLD had actually become the treasurer of ORIT.
                    Frequent visitors to Mexico were Serafino Romaldi and my brother Bill and even
                    more frequently Andy McClellan. In addition to Jesse Friedman working in
                    Cuernavaca on the education side, AIFLD also had an office and representatives
                    in Mexico City. I believe the last representative in Mexico City was Pepe
                    Sueiro. So AIFLD had an office there and was working closely with the CTM and
                    ORIT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what about representatives of the various trade
                        secretariats? I am thinking of people like John Snyder and Wally Legge.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes. The trade secretariat people would come through frequently. They
                    did not have offices there. I think only the metalworkers had offices there and
                    the metalworker (IMF) officers were Mexicans. But there was a lot of trade
                    secretariat activity. I remember the International Ladies' Garment Workers'
                    Union coming in and working in cooperation with ORIT and the AIFLD. They
                    organized the first Inter-American Congress of Textile and Garment Workers
                    [Unions], which was held in Mexico and was really quite successful. I remember
                    Saby Nehama coming down as the representative of the Garment Workers and later
                    on Sasha Zimmerman. I think the textile workers [provided] a good example of
                    what could happen with cooperation between the secretariats, ORIT, the AIFLD,
                    and the unions themselves in the textile field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to move on to Peru now, John?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Okay. I arrived in Peru in 1967. The Communists were quite strong. The
                    General Confederation of Peruvian Labor (CGTP) was in fact the dominant labor
                    organization. There was a small Christian organization, which CLASC had been
                    supporting both financially and with personnel, but they never really got off
                    the ground. The other major trade union movement was the APRISTA movement which
                    was the CTP. With an aging leadership and limited finances, they came to depend
                    a great deal on ORIT and the AIFLD. One of the keys to this was that Arturo
                    Jauregui, who was the General Secretary of ORIT, the Inter-American Regional
                    Organization of Workers, was also a Peruvian and an APRISTA. He encouraged that
                    kind of cooperation and in fact the AIFLD set up what was called the Centro de
                    Studios Laborales Peruanos (CELP), which conducted courses mostly for CTP
                    unions, but there were some independent unions as well who sent their workers to
                    participate in those courses. The role of the American labor movement in Peru
                    was, of course, much more pronounced than it was in Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall who the representatives of the AIFLD were at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: When I arrived, Tom Miller was the director. He subsequently went off to
                    Asia [to work] with the Asian [American Free Labor] Institute. He was
                    temporarily replaced by Bill Douglas, Dr. William Douglas, who has been involved
                    in a lot of the educational activities of the AIFLD. At the time when he was in
                    Peru as the interim director, he was writing a very interesting book on
                    democracy, which was subsequently published. His assistant was Roberto (Bob)
                    Cazares. They brought in Chuck Wheeler from Argentina to do some trouble
                    shooting and help put things back together after some internal problems. That
                    was basically the staff when I was there. Chuck Wheeler was acting director for
                    awhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they an effective group?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Extremely effective. In fact there were a lot of attacks in the press by
                    the Communists alleging that the CTP had become nothing more than a puppet being
                    manipulated by the Americans. In truth the CTP and most of its unions, with
                    perhaps the exceptions of the Sugar Workers Union and the Clerical Workers
                    Union, were just plain poor and welcomed financial support and the opportunity
                    to have people come in to conduct seminars who knew something about organizing
                    trade unions and putting together organizations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How strong were the Communists? Were they the
                        majority?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: They were in the majority. They were extremely strong. They were called
                    “Moscovites.” Their main source of support came from the Soviets. There was a
                    smaller group of so-called “Chinese Communists” that didn't really amount to too
                    much, although it is interesting that today the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)
                    would call itself “Maoist” and probably embrace some of those early
                    organizations supported by the Chinese. But it was the Soviets who backed the
                    CGTP, and the CGTP was capable of shutting down the country-I always used that
                    as a barometer-and the CTP, the APRISTAS, which on two or three occasions called
                    nation-wide strikes, were not [capable of shutting down the country] without the
                    participation of the Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how effective were these strikes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Oh, they were very effective. They controlled transportation and
                    utilities for the most part, and they could really effectively shut down the
                    country. It didn't happen very often, but when they decided to do it, they could
                    do it. They had that potential. They could be very disruptive. One of the main
                    reasons the military continued to try to hold a tight rein on the nation was the
                    threat of Communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall who our Ambassador was at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, John Wesley Jones was our Ambassador, and his deputy was Ernest
                    Siracusa. Subsequently, Toby Belcher and Ed Clark replaced them in those roles.
                    That was about the time of the overthrow of the Belaunde government, the
                    democratic government of Peru, which was overthrown by a military coup in 1968.
                    A lot of it was blamed on negotiations with the IPC, which was Standard Oil. The
                    Embassy was accused unjustly of having favored IPC in this whole undertaking.
                    Although many [of the Peruvian military] had been trained in Panama under US
                    auspices, a lot of them came out of their own [equivalent of] West Point in
                    Peru, where Marxists had infiltrated. When the military government took over, it
                    was not only Marxist in orientation and focus but strongly anti-American. On the
                    labor side it favored the CGTP, the Communist Confederation, which gained even
                    more strength and more prestige at the expense of the APRISTA CTP. So the fall
                    of the government directly affected my work in the labor field. In fact I was
                    declared persona non grata, but by the time they ordered me out because of my
                    close work with the APRISTAS and with the CTP, I had already gone on direct
                    transfer to Buenos Aires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you say that the militant Communists at that time in
                        Peru were as violent as the Sendero Luminoso [Shining Path] movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Oh, no. No, they did advocate a lot of marches and confrontations but
                    they were not involved in the kind of murderous lunacy [that the Shining Path
                    is]. It is difficult for me to comprehend any organization as wild as the
                    Shining Path, except some of the younger people in Argentina involved in various
                    revolutionary movements, which were also quite violent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, John, that when you got to Argentina the situation
                        was “no bed of roses.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: No, I succeeded you there. I think there were two months during which
                    the post wasn't covered [by a labor attach�]. The “Cordobazo” had already
                    happened when you were there, which was the worker uprising in Cordoba. I would
                    say it was not so much an uprising as just wild riots which did a lot of damage
                    and in which people were killed and a lot of people hurt. Then subsequent to
                    that, Augusto Vandor, the head of the Metalworkers Union was murdered. I was in
                    Argentina for four years. I came after the “Cordobazo” and I left after the
                    “regresso,” Cordobazo meaning, of course, what happened in Cordoba, and the
                    regresso meaning the return of Peron in 1973 which was another very bloody kind
                    of affair out at the airport at Ezeiza. So when people ask, “When were you in
                    Argentina?” I say, “I was there from after the Cordobazo to after the
                    regresso.”</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>And it was a very tumultuous time. There was a lot of upheaval. That was the same
                    time that the Tupamaros were very strong in Uruguay. These wild organizations,
                    the Revolutionary Army of the People and the Montoneros, the youth wing of the
                    radical left wing of the Peronist party, were doing very violent things. Their
                    theory was that the only way to have a just society is to destroy what exists,
                    and they set out to do that. These were basically Trotskyites on the
                    non-Peronist side, and they would shoot down policemen and some innocent people.
                    Some of the AIFLD classrooms were bombed. There was quite a movement on the left
                    to sew disruption and to do it violently. This is what eventually led in the
                    1970s to the repression on the part of the military, which got completely out of
                    hand. Some 8,000 people disappeared. I think that's when “disappear” became a
                    verb in the language of Latin Americans. I was in Argentina at a very exciting
                    time. You could see that with the return of Peron, who had pretty much dominated
                    the country even while in exile in Madrid, the movement that he had built was
                    beginning to crumble and that new forces were coming to play in the political
                    situation in Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, why were many of these labor leaders
                        assassinated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, there was some corruption in the Argentine unions, but the
                    assassinations were more political than anything having to do with an Argentine
                    style Mafia. Vandor was the head of 62 organizations which was a collection the
                    staunchest Peronist unions dating back to Eva Peron's day when the unions
                    developed there political power. Vandor was the most influential leader in the
                    Peronist labor movement. When he was assassinated, the number one labor leader
                    in terms of notoriety and popularity was probably Jose Alonzo of the Garment
                    Workers. Jose Alonzo's case was a little bit different. He was the head of the
                    25 “participationist” unions. These were Peronist but they believed that the
                    best way to represent the workers of Argentina was to participate in military
                    governments, particularly in the government of Ongania. So when Alonzo was
                    assassinated in 1970-he was gunned down on the street on his way to work-there
                    was a lot of speculation that it was because he was advocating cooperation with
                    the military government which [he thought] would lead to the restitution of
                    democracy. That was considered traitorous by the hard-line Peronists. So to that
                    extent, I think, his murder was somewhat different from Vandor's murder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall a “group of 32” headed up by one Juan Carlos
                        Brunetti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes. This organization was the original labor movement prior to Peron
                    and had its origins with the Socialists of Europe. These were the old Argentine
                    Socialists for the most part who were connected with Americo Ghioldi and other
                    Socialist political leaders. By the time I arrived in Argentina, they had almost
                    completely lost their political power and influence. I met with Brunetti on
                    several occasions. The [group of 32] had some trade union strength in Rosario
                    and a few unions in Buenos Aires, but by the end of 1969, they were no longer
                    considered to be significant.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, I believe that when you were there AIFLD had a
                        fairly extensive workers' housing project.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, that was built mostly with the Light and Power Workers Union and a
                    couple of other unions. I know that the American Institute for Free Labor
                    Development (AIFLD) was criticized in some circles, particularly in the old AID
                    circles among people who had to accept what AIFLD proposed to do when AIFLD was
                    able to get [a project approved] in Washington, and also by those who resisted
                    promoters such as my brother, [AIFLD Executive Director William Doherty], who
                    was an excellent promoter. There was a lot of resistance, and there were some
                    people who say that there were mixed results in terms of what AIFLD was able to
                    accomplish or not able to accomplish in these countries. In Argentina the AIFLD
                    served as a bridge between the Peronists and the Peronist unions, which
                    represented the bulk of labor in Argentina, and American labor as well as
                    between the Peronist political movement and our government. AIFLD also
                    contributed to bringing the Peronists back into the Inter-American trade union
                    organizations. AIFLD served as a bridge through things like the housing projects
                    and the education programs. You have to remember that in Peron's last days
                    before he was overthrown in 1955, Peron was involved in direct confrontations
                    with the United States. And going back to World War II, of course, he was very
                    sympathetic towards the Germans. It wasn't until the last minute prior to peace
                    being declared that the Argentine Government announced, in a very opportunist
                    way, that it was with the Allies. So there was a history of antipathy, a history
                    of Peron preaching what he called “the third position” in the world, where you
                    would be neither Marxist nor Yankee. Then there was a lot of opposition to the
                    US in the Peronist movement, particularly in labor circles so that most of the
                    most powerful Argentine labor leaders were very anti-American. I think AIFLD,
                    more than any other institution, contributed to breaking that down, not
                    completely, but all of a sudden after several years of hard work there on
                    housing and education and in other areas of cooperation, we became persona grata
                    with the Peronist labor movement. The labor attach� could go into any trade
                    union in the country and sit down and talk and that wasn't possible when, say,
                    someone like John Fishburn was there [in the 1940's].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I certainly agree, John. And I recall that the Peronists
                        had an extensive labor attach� corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, in the days of Peron and after, that 10 year period from 1945 to
                    1955, Argentina had a labor attach� in almost every country of Latin
                    America-certainly the most significant countries-as well as in Europe. Argentina
                    had a labor attach� corps which the Peronists were quite proud of. It was the
                    labor attach�s' job to go out and become a third force through an organization
                    called “ATLAS,” [the Latin American Association of Trade Unions]. They tried to
                    form [an international labor federation with a] third position which would be
                    between ORIT and CTAL, the Communist Latin American Federation, which Vicente
                    Lombardo Toledano had founded and pushed. ATLAS was going to be the third force
                    and the [Argentine] labor attach�s in those countries were the ones who were
                    going not only to carry the day but carry the money and carry the support from
                    Peron. He invested a lot money trying to organize ATLAS into a viable force, but
                    it never really got off the ground.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And one of your Ambassadors there was John Lodge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: He was the Ambassador for my entire four years there. He was a nice man,
                    but he didn't have a very good understanding of [the political situation]. When
                    he first arrived there, he thought Peronists were Communists, and he was shocked
                    to find out that a lot of them were Nationalist Socialists and right-wingers.
                    But I think that over our four years together, he learned a lot about the
                    Peronists. And let's face it. There were different grades of Peronists there.
                    There were “participationists” and there were hard-liners. The sugar workers up
                    in Tucaman were clamoring for Peron's return right to the very end. Peron was
                    able to call strikes from exile in Madrid. He was able to pass the word that “I
                    want a nation-wide strike” and there was a nation-wide strike, and a nation-wide
                    strike in Argentina was total right down to people working at the race tracks
                    and in the casinos. Peron had that kind of power.</p>
                <p>I have an interesting story. The head of the Insurance Workers Union was a man by
                    the name of Jos� Vallegas. He was called a “Peronista sin Peron,” a Peronist
                    without Peron. Actually he had been a Peronist but was no longer a Peronist. He
                    was not even what they called a “neo-Peronist.” Argentina is a wonderful place
                    for a labor attach� to work, because the Argentines are great talkers. You can
                    go into their offices and sit down and have a cup of coffee and talk about
                    things that probably would be secret in other countries. You would get the whole
                    scoop right there, or at least their version of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Anyway, I went to talk with Bahias and I asked him to explain to me the “myth” of
                    Peron, the mito of Peron. And he said, “Well, that's the problem with so many of
                    you foreigners. You don't understand that it wasn't a myth; it was real.” And he
                    recounted how when he was a nine or ten year old boy in Resistencia, the only
                    thing he owned was a pair of pants and a rope that he tied them up with. And
                    when the loud speaker came down the country road and said that all boys from
                    nine to twelve were to report to the stadium in Resistencia to participate in
                    the Eva Peron football championship, which is soccer to us, he walked eleven
                    miles. And when he got there, they gave him a shirt with a name on it, and they
                    gave him shorts and shoes which said “campeonato de futball Eva Peron.” And when
                    he finished playing that day, they said, “We want you here every Saturday, and
                    that uniform is yours to wear.” And he said he wore it until it wore out. He was
                    so proud of it that he wore it to school and wherever he went. And he said,
                    “That's not a myth; that's real!” And that's the kind of influence Eva Peron had
                    on poor people in that country. I thought that was a valuable lesson for any
                    labor attach� coming in trying to understand the Argentine psyche and what makes
                    them tick and how a Peronist movement could survive even though the leader had
                    been deposed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very, very interesting about the “Peronistas sin
                        Peron”. How did you classify Juan Jose Taccone and the Light and Power Union
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, I think Juan Jose Taccone was probably the most influential
                    [leader]. Even though his wasn't the largest union, it was probably the best run
                    union and it was probably one of the best heeled unions, because in the
                    tradition of Juan and Eva Peron, they began all kinds of programs under the
                    Perons. They owned their own hotels, their own vacation centers, their own
                    clinic, and their own worker education school.</p>
                <p>The workers of the Light and Power Company became totally identified with the
                    union and with its leadership and I thought the leadership on the whole was
                    probably the finest I had seen in Latin America. They were very astute
                    politically; they were sophisticated internationally; and they were powerful in
                    Argentina.</p>
                <p>By the way, when Juan Jose Taccone hired people, they weren't necessarily from
                    his union. He hired a lot of professional people out of the universities to head
                    up various departments in his union. It was as well organized as any union I
                    have ever encountered anywhere including the United States. Basically when we
                    went to Argentina, we were not dealing with Peruvians or Ecuadorians or
                    Salvadorans. We were dealing with Argentines and the Argentines, thanks to
                    Peron, had developed a very strong labor movement. It was already strong before
                    we arrived on the scene in the early 1960s.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of the AID Mission toward AIFLD
                        activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: The AID missions in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina, which are my three
                    countries of experience with Mission-AIFLD relationships, were not sympathetic.
                    They felt that labor had no business in development programs. They felt that
                    AIFLD was being crammed down their throats, and they resisted it. I'm not saying
                    that every AID director felt that way. When I was in Mexico, Clare Boonstra, who
                    later became Ambassador to Costa Rica, was the DCM. I saw him years later and
                    reminded him of a conversation [we had]. I was there in the AID office
                    negotiating the AIFLD contract, trying to keep AID from closing down the AIFLD
                    programs. At the time the labor attach� was on extended home leave, so it fell
                    to me to defend the AIFLD program. It was difficult for AID to separate me from
                    my brother, [AIFLD Executive Director William Doherty], and I remember being
                    quite upset in the meeting as we argued back and forth. The AID director was a
                    man by the name of Ainsworth. Finally when the meeting broke up, Clare Boonstra
                    asked me into his office, and he said, “You're going to have to remember
                    something about your brother. He's successful; he's a promoter; and successful
                    promoters step on feet, and when you were in there trying to negotiate an AIFLD
                    contract, there were an awful lot of hurt feet. So whenever you get involved
                    with this in the future, remember that.” (laughter) Boonstra didn't feel that
                    way about AIFLD; he was very supportive. Now AIFLD has gained acceptance over
                    the years, but in the early days when they were getting started, there was
                    resistance from the insiders to these interlopers coming in from labor. There
                    were some philosophical differences, but I think personality differences also
                    had a lot to do with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you care to comment on Communist activities in
                        Argentina at that time and particularly [on the role of] the Cubans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, that was interesting. Of course Argentina was the home of Che
                    Guevara. He came out of Argentina as a medical student, I believe, and then as a
                    doctor joined up with Castro. The Cubans tried mightily to influence the
                    Argentine labor movement. They did not have a great deal of success. Most of
                    their success was in influencing student organizations and in the “ejercito,”
                    the people's army, which was Trotskyite, and to some extent with the Montoneros.
                    Most of their success was with the fringe groups, not with the main line
                    Peronist ones. The Cubans were having greater success than the Soviets. There
                    was an antipathy towards the Soviets among the Peronists. I was very much
                    surprised after coming from Peru where the Communists were in the majority in
                    the labor leadership. In Argentina the Communists were far less effective and
                    were not really an element in the revolutionary movement that eventually brought
                    repression from the military. I didn't think the Communists were all that
                    strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can only recall one union which was under some Communist
                        influence and that was the Chemical Workers Union. But I don't think they
                        had any effect at all on the overall Argentine labor scene. After Argentina,
                        John, what was your next assignment? Did you spend any time in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: In 1973 I transferred from Argentina to Brussels. I had been on home
                    leave not long before that. I did come back for some French language training.
                    The only French I had dated back to 1954 and 1955, when I was in Paris with the
                    OEEC and much of it had disappeared, so I did go back to Washington for some
                    French training before Brussels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would say that your work in Brussels was completely
                        different from that in Latin America in that you were dealing with many of
                        the trade secretariats and the International Confederation of Free Trade
                        Unions (ICFTU) in addition to the Belgium unions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: It was different. My job at the US Mission to the European Community
                    basically had three parts. One was dealing with the international organizations,
                    primarily the ICFTU and the Christian WCL. The Communists were there. They had a
                    joint office between the French CGT and the Italian CGIL. I did not have liaison
                    with them.</p>
                <p>Another major part of my function in Brussels was [to cover the activities of ]
                    the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), a relatively new body organized
                    along the lines of EC membership. I also covered three or four secretariats. I
                    recall specifically going frequently to meet with [the secretariats of] the
                    textile workers, the journalists, and the teachers unions, which were
                    headquartered in Brussels. On top of that, I [followed] the European Commission,
                    with [a special focus on] the Commissioner for Social Affairs and with anything
                    that dealt with social affairs in the European Community.</p>
                <p>Then my third function was covering the European Parliament which meant being
                    either in Luxembourg or in Strasbourg every other month, reporting on
                    developments and general liaison. I was also in charge of the annual exchange
                    between the International Relations Committee of the [US] House [of
                    Representatives] and the European Parliament, which took up maybe a month of my
                    time each year. So there was more diversity. One thing that was the same, when I
                    compare my work in Latin America with the job in Europe, was that just as the
                    trade unions in Latin America were connected with a political party and had a
                    political philosophy, the trade unions of Europe were as well, and in dealing
                    with the trade unions of the Benelux [countries], particularly Belgium and
                    Luxembourg, I was dealing with Christians or Socialists or with Social
                    Democrats, and to that extent I had already experienced the philosophical or
                    ideological aspects of trade unionism.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>I say to people who preceded me there and succeeded me there as labor attach�,
                    “Listen, let's keep this a secret. Being labor attach� to EC Brussels is the
                    creme de la creme of labor attach� spots, because of not only the tremendously
                    broad scope of the work but the fascinating kinds of situations which would
                    develop in the various aspects of the work there.” I think that the most
                    important aspect of the work while I was there-and also [during the tenure of]
                    Harry Pollak, my immediate predecessor-was that the AFL-CIO had withdrawn from
                    the ICFTU, and therefore there were no American [labor union] representatives in
                    Brussels at that time. The labor attach� therefore was probably the best contact
                    that our labor people had, certainly in the way of liaison. I recall Irving
                    Brown coming often to Brussels, and I would be in contact with the Belgian
                    Socialists or with ICFTU people or ETUC people and have meetings at my home or
                    at some mutually agreed place, and I would be privy to the conversations that
                    went on. These were very interesting and exciting times. I feel that the job in
                    Brussels is an extremely important one from a labor point of view, even with the
                    AFL-CIO back in the fold and taking a more active role in European and
                    international organizations there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, it has often been said that the CIA was involved in
                        the activities of the International Trade Secretariats and the ICFTU. Would
                        you like to comment on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, I think allegations of CIA involvement in labor-in Latin America
                    as well as with international or European organizations-were greatly
                    exaggerated. I'm not saying there was no CIA activity, but I think it was
                    exaggerated in terms of all the sensational books in which you read about the
                    CIA underwriting so many trade union organizations. I have no direct knowledge
                    of what was underwritten by whom, but I do know that in my stay in each of those
                    countries [that I served in], direct contact between the CIA and the labor
                    organizations in those countries was minimal. It was practically nonexistent in
                    Brussels. This [question of CIA involvement] stems from the post-war period when
                    we were very much concerned about what directions the Soviets would be taking.
                    With the Communists so dominant and growing so rapidly and strongly in France
                    and Italy and elsewhere in Europe, I think we were unprepared for it. By “we” I
                    mean American labor and the American government. In those days there was a lot
                    of cooperation. Irving Brown was probably the point man on many kinds of things.
                    We know that historically he became involved with the dockworkers' strike [in
                    France]. I think a lot of the talk of CIA involvement has to do with the early
                    days, not the days when I was in Latin America in the 1960s, although there was
                    some, and not the days when I was in Europe in the early and late 1970s, when I
                    subsequently went to Portugal. I thought the CIA involvement in labor was
                    minimal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On another subject, John, how did the European unions
                        regard the activities of US labor attach�s and the AFL-CIO, particularly
                        people like Irving Brown?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, there was a tremendous feeling, particularly among the Socialists
                    of Europe, that the AFL-CIO was blindly anti-Communist and that the AFL-CIO's
                    attempt to influence unions in the third world was misguided. These were mostly
                    intellectual type leaders, and they could not accept the AFL-CIO's
                    anti-Communist position on the international side even though these people
                    themselves were anti-Communist. As a labor attach� in Europe, it was a different
                    ball game. In Peru I was on my own. I might occasionally bump into a British
                    labor attach�, who had a regional function, whether it be Peru and Bolivia and
                    Ecuador or maybe Mexico and Central America, and to that extent I had contacts
                    with labor attach�s from other countries. When I got to Argentina there was a
                    group of labor attach�s, diplomats from other countries already organized. We
                    almost had our own dean of the group. There were probably seven or eight labor
                    attach�s. Just to tick off a few, there was a French labor attach�, a German, a
                    British, a Swedish, a Dane, and a few others. I think there was also a Spanish
                    labor attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there was a Spaniard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: The Spaniard was there for many years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as I recall his name was Francisco La Matta.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: That's right. La Matta. Thank you for refreshing my memory. [In
                    Brussels] we set up meetings with the labor attach�s, because the European or
                    international leaders preferred to meet with us [as a group]. Although they were
                    willing to meet one on one, they preferred to have a monthly meeting with the
                    labor attach�s and one of us would take charge of that for one month and then
                    take turns arranging these schedules. We would meet with the ICFTU or ETUC or
                    with one of the secretariats. Sometimes we'd even meet with the EC Commissioner
                    on labor. The labor attach�s from the various embassies there had a very close
                    working relationship. We shared information, and we often talked on the phone. I
                    found that this working relationship facilitated my work, and I am sure the
                    others felt the same way about me and their colleagues in the “Labor Attach�
                    Corps” as it was called. So it was different from working in Latin America where
                    you were more or less working solo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the Ambassador you had at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Joe Greenwald was the first Ambassador. Deane Hinton was our second
                    Ambassador. Both are very fine men. Both were very supportive in terms of seeing
                    the need for the labor attach� function, particularly as it related to the
                    political [sphere]. One of the reasons why I was involved in the European
                    Parliament was because of the relationship of the trade unions to the political
                    parties. So they saw labor attach�s in a much broader sense, not just in the
                    sense of labor reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And your final assignment, as I recall, was in Portugal
                        and you went there at a very exciting time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: It was exciting but my immediate predecessor, [Dale Povenmire], had the
                    brunt of the excitement and the fear, I suppose, because things were very, very
                    hectic after Portugal declared its colonies free in Africa and in effect brought
                    millions of Portuguese home and tried to integrate them into the economy and
                    society. (Telephone Interruption)</p>
                <p>To continue on that point, with the overthrow of Salazar and the end of 40 years
                    of dictatorship, you had politics breaking out all over. The Communists became
                    very, very active and for a while there it looked like they might be able to
                    take over the government, so you can imagine how hard pressed the Socialists and
                    the Social Democrats were, as well as ourselves, in trying to put together
                    programs that would save the day. So those days were much more exciting than
                    mine, although mine were exciting enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Frank Carlucci the Ambassador at that time, John?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: He was the Ambassador when I arrived in Portugal. However, he left
                    within less than two months, and Ambassador Dick Bloomfield took over. He came,
                    just as I did, from Latin America. When Carlucci was there, the main thrust [of
                    our policy] was to help the Socialists get on their feet as they were the most
                    formidable counterweight to the Communists and the main hope there as we saw
                    it-and quite correctly so for the future of democracy in Portugal. So Carlucci's
                    focus was comprehensive in scope. When Bloomfield arrived in 1978, this [policy
                    of strengthening the Socialists] had pretty much been achieved. Although the
                    Communists were very, very strong, the Socialists had become the dominant party.
                    The Social Democrats were also very, very strong. Our main objective then on the
                    labor side became a quest to try to bring the labor movement of the Social
                    Democrats and the labor movement of the Socialists together, and we worked very
                    hard on this. The AFL-CIO, at the Embassy's request, sent in Mike Boggs, and
                    Mike stayed there for a whole month in which he worked with both sides very
                    diligently. Over a period of about a year, we were able to have some influence
                    on the creation and development of what became the UGT, the General Workers
                    Union of Portugal, which was founded in 1979. It was a cooperative effort of the
                    Socialists and the Social Democrats with encouragement from us, the various
                    trade secretariats, and the AFL-CIO. So in those terms I think that I was there
                    at a very, very interesting time in Portugal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, in wrapping up this interview, would you care to
                        comment on the role of labor attach�s and their background? Should labor
                        attach�s come from the AFL-CIO or from among regular FSOs or from the Labor
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, back in [1943] our first labor attach�, Dan Horowitz, went out to
                    Chile, and then came John Fishburn to Latin America. We were late into the game
                    and it was really after World War II that we took an interest in labor. I think
                    we probably had the right mix in the early days. We had labor attach�s who came
                    from the labor movement; we had labor attach�s who came from the Labor
                    Department; and we had some career [Foreign Service Officer] labor attach�s. Of
                    course today almost all of them are career officers. I have seen some wonderful,
                    excellent people who were really well prepared who came out of the labor
                    movement and who worked as labor attach�s, and to be quite candid, I have seen
                    some very bad ones. I've seen some excellent career officers, and there are
                    quite a few of them. One who comes to mind is Tony Freeman. Another is John
                    Kean. I've seen them in the field and I've seen them function extremely well.
                    I've also seen some Foreign Service Officers who weren't particularly good in
                    dealing with workers and their representatives or in the whole scheme of social
                    affairs. I don't think there is any set prescription. I think that the fact that
                    career officers are now coming into the labor function and that they can be
                    interested to stay in it for more than one tour is good. I am concerned that
                    there has always been a natural bias against labor per se in the Foreign
                    Service. I know a lot of Foreign Service Officers will deny that, but it is
                    true. Therefore in an up or out system where people are trying to get ahead and
                    become ambassadors-that is their ultimate objective-not many of them want to
                    hang the labor stigma on them for more than one tour, but I think labor is an
                    extremely important field and the Foreign Service tends to underestimate its
                    importance, particularly in the light of the relationship of unions world wide
                    with political movements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much, John. I think that was a very fine
                        answer because I agree with it. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Yes, but when you get two people who agree with each other you don't
                    really resolve anything! Do you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, looking over the [interview outline], I see one area
                        of activity we haven't touched on-the USIA labor officers and the exchange
                        programs. Would you like to say a few words about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, [we used to have] an active and activist labor program. For
                    example, when I went into Peru, I had an assistant labor attach�, a USIA labor
                    officer, and a local Peruvian, who also assisted me, and two secretaries. Well,
                    the Peruvian labor movement certainly was not that strong or influential to
                    warrant all those people in one office in the Embassy. But there were times when
                    I think you needed an AID labor representative, a USIS labor representative, and
                    as much help as you could get on the labor side. I don't think that we are any
                    longer in that kind of situation, particularly with the changes that have taken
                    place recently in Eastern Europe, unless it's in Eastern Europe itself, where we
                    are going to need that kind of personnel and cooperation in establishing ties
                    and working together with the unions, as we did in Latin America. That may well
                    be the case [in Eastern Europe]. I don't really know Eastern Europe, but it
                    might be a situation where we need labor information officers and AID type labor
                    people as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you feel about the USIA exchange program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: Oh, well. I think I was one of the greatest exploiters of it. If USIA
                    mentioned a grant, I immediately moved toward my phone, and I had a permanent
                    list in each country I was in of potential young labor leaders whom I thought
                    should be considered for scholarships or for visitor grants. I really fought in
                    the Embassy meetings for as many in the social and labor field and in politics
                    as I could. I was usually quite successful. I thought [the International
                    Visitor's Program] was an excellent program, particularly in the sense that the
                    foreign visitors were going to the United States and getting tailor-made
                    programs and a very particular kind of reception. They were not just coming in
                    droves as they did in the St. John's College days when we were doing mass
                    orientations and conducting huge seminars. I think the Visitor's Program was far
                    more effective because you could pinpoint people whom you and your contacts in
                    the labor movement felt were potentially future leaders. If we look around Latin
                    America today, we'll see an awful lot of those people who came to the United
                    States under some grant program or other and who are now in positions of power.
                    That isn't to say that all of [those who went] are. It's obviously a small
                    percentage, but even so that made it worth while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other matter I forgot, John, is the subject of US
                        employers and labor- management relations in US firms in the countries in
                        which you served.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>DOHERTY: Well, generally speaking labor relations in US firms were enlightened
                    compared with labor relations in their own national companies. There was a time
                    in the early part of the century and probably right up through World War II when
                    our companies had an attitude that they were getting cheap labor and since
                    [foreign nationals] were poorly organized-I'm thinking of Peru in
                    particular-they didn't have to pay much attention to labor or labor-management
                    relations, but that day has passed. I think a very good example of that kind of
                    behavior coming back to haunt American companies was the mining and petroleum
                    companies in various countries. I think of the International Petroleum Company
                    (IPC) or Standard Oil in Peru. There was a time when they were unjustifiably
                    proud of the fact that they could hire workers and rent land for purposes of
                    extracting minerals for next to nothing. I also recall mining companies in Peru
                    which did the same thing and which really did exploit. I remember I was at the
                    American Club shortly after the overthrow of the Belaunde government in Peru,
                    and I was talking with an American business man who lamented that it was not
                    like the good old days when the Marcona mining company could extract the ore and
                    rent one of its ships to the government to bring the ore to the United States,
                    and then fill up with ballast water in Panama on the way back and sell the water
                    to the Peruvian government. This man said, “Those were the good old days.” Well,
                    the good old days were the bad old days that “came home to roost” with IPC. IPC,
                    at the time it was taken over by the Peruvian Government, had developed quite
                    wisely the finest system of industrial and labor relations probably in Latin
                    America, but it was too late. The antipathy that had built up over the years
                    [caused] the leaders of Peru to overlook whatever good the company had done in
                    the way of housing and social development and industrial relations. The Peruvian
                    Government took over the company, [an act which] caused great problems between
                    our two countries at the time, because the Peruvian Government refused to pay
                    compensation. Today I think that the most enlightened industrial companies in
                    Latin America are US firms. We are living in a different era. Would you agree
                    with that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I definitely agree with you on that, John.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: But there was a history of exploitation back in the early days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, [for example,] the United Fruit Company.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DOHERTY: United Fruit would be another one which I meant to mention along with
                    mining and petroleum. And United Fruit also has good labor relations today if
                    you visit Honduras or elsewhere in Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would certainly agree with you that many of these
                        companies have much better labor- management relations overseas than they do
                        here in the US. DOHERTY: Oh, I didn't say that. You said that.
