                <p>War Diary</p>
                <p>December 1944</p>
                <p>August 1942</p>
                <p>Following is a transcription of the War Diary of my father, Gerald Warner, who
                    was a consul in Kobe, Japan when Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941.
                    The diary covers the period from December 8 to August 28, 1942. He was interned
                    in his house in Kobe for 6 months and then traveled to New York on diplomatic
                    exchange ships, first the Asama Maru and then the Gripsholm.</p>
                <p>The diary was written in my father's tiny scrawl on 3x5 paper - 283 pages, 3 hole
                    punched at the top, tied with string - and was given to my brother, Arthur
                    Warner, by my mother, sometime after my father's death in 1989.</p>
                <p>My mother and older brother and sister (who were 4 and 3 in Dec. 1941) had been
                    sent back to the States in February of 1941 when trouble started brewing in the
                    Far East. I was born in March of 1944 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, my father's
                    next posting after Japan.</p>
                <p>I have transcribed the diary just as written, with comments in parentheses and
                    italics. Other notes, abbreviations, etc. are at the end. Anne Warner, January

                <p>At 4:30 pm. Watanabe called to say we must go to Tor [Hotel] could not go homJ.
                    Govt orders. We all wished to go to our houses.</p>
                <p>Put in one wing of ground floor. I had room 35. Not allowed to communicate with
                    each other. Supper brought in individually and so to bed.</p>
                <p>Tues Dec. 9</p>
                <p>Watanabe called to say I should go with him to officCons. - at 11:30 &amp; have
                    lunch there. He wanted the safes opened. Said he must see Tower about that.
                    [Arthur Tower, consul, temporarily in charge of the Consulate during the absence
                    on home leave of Samuel Sokobin, the chief consul. Warner, also a consul, was
                    the next ranking officer.] Said Tower could not open &amp; I said I could not
                    either. Asked me to influence Tower to open safes but I said he was not free to
                    open safes without orders &amp; I could do nothing either. He said he had orders
                    from his govt to take over everything in office &amp; must have safes opened to
                    do so. Said he must deal with Tower on that.</p>
                <p>Went at 11:30 in charcoal burner [some sort of vehicle?] that got stalled &amp;
                    took to 12:15 to reach office. Tower steadfast refused to open safes. Watanabe
                    said he did not wish to use threats but wanted safes opened. Kept going out
                    coming back, etc. Asked about inventory &amp; we couldn't get at it in Dusty's
                    safe [Otis “Dusty” Rhoades, vice consul, was in Tokyo at the time] but Tower
                    offered to help prepare one. Had lunch and time to think it over but Tower held
                    out despite veiled threats. Took me to separate room &amp; searched me and tried
                    to get me to open safes but I refused to. Tower said without Gov's order he
                    could do nothing though if it had come to violence he would have opened.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>At about 4:30 pm a Mr. Masuda from the Kencho [local government office] &amp;
                    five or six henchman came into Tower's office and said they understood Tower had
                    refused to assist in turning over office things. Tower said he was perfectly
                    willing to turn over the furniture etc. as is. Masuda said then that would be
                    all that was needed &amp; there must have been some misunderstanding and the
                    subject of opening the safes was dropped. Tower &amp; I assisted in preparing
                    the inventory, listing things by rooms and Mary Ogawa typed the list &amp; Takio
                    &amp; I checked things &amp; henchmen put on seals.</p>
                <p>We were told to take away all of our personal things which we did. I put all
                    things on desks inside.</p>
                <p>Back to Tor for dinner and others were worried about us.</p>
                <p>Wed., Dec. 10</p>
                <p>Allowed to walk in garden.</p>
                <p>Tower &amp; I to Kencho [Headquarters] and saw Chief Hasegawa of Prefectual
                    Gaijiba who said he wished all to go smoothly and they'd facilitate our stay as
                    much as possible.</p>
                <p>Asked if we'd like to stay at Hotel. (Said he didn't know about who would stand
                    expense but we should act as if we were to pay or all move to one residence.
                    Said we'd consult others but all could move to my house.</p>
                <p>Asked about other Americans and they said some were being kept in houses others
                    in certain places but all were well and steps being taken to take care of their
                    property.</p>
                <p>They said they wished to give us equal treatment to that being rec'd by J.
                    Consuls in U. S. I said that the Asahi of Dec. 10 (that evening) had carried a
                    tel. interview of the J.C.G. in N.Y. with B.A. saying he was being restricted to
                    movement bet. office and house which were both surrounded by police.</p>
                <p>Said we could talk with each other &amp; play cards etc. but could not talk with
                    outsiders. Said our reasonable wants would be fulfilled if possiblas for food,
                    etc. Said he was in charge of us and we could communicate through our guards.
                    Our guards were Watanabe, Ito &amp; Higawa &amp; a M.P. in uniform. For funds we
                    said we had some �15 M [M = thousand] in bank.</p>
                <p>Upon returning to hotel and talking to others decided to stay in hotel as
                    Shimamoto's wife and child would be coming to live with him &amp; it would be
                    too crowded in my house with 8 people. Informed Masuda to this effect when he
                    called that P.M.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>S. [Shimamoto] was in long consultation with officials &amp; wife &amp; finally
                    told me he had decided to leave &amp; go back to wife's house. Called in Tower
                    &amp; he agreed. I suggested that S. submit a letter of resignation for the
                    purpose of the records &amp; Tower got that from him. S. left that night after
                    again having gone to Kencho with the officials &amp; Mary O. [Ogawa] asked him
                    upon return how he expected to earn living &amp; he said he'd make out O.K. as
                    J.'s has promised him a job. Wonder what he'll be doing.</p>
                <p>Mary O. said the authorities had tried to get her to remain in J. promising her
                    freedom &amp; assistance in finding work. Said she was after all of J. race and
                    furthermore they couldn't guarantee she'd be permitted to go with us &amp; she
                    might be locked up here for 2 yrs. But she said all her folks are home in the
                    U.S. and she is an American &amp; wants to go home so will stick with us &amp;
                    take her chances.</p>
                <p>Played cards that eveninthe first bridge for Roy Melbourne but he'll catch on.
                    Mary certain to.</p>
                <p>And so to bed.</p>
                <p>Thurs. Dec. 11</p>
                <p>Room boys refuse to bring papers despite permission to have them. Said Kempei
                    wouldn't allow it. But I went down the hall &amp; bought a chronicle. Sinking of
                    our fleet in Hawaii being played up. Done before war declared as usuadone in J.
                    Ch. [Japanese Chinese] and J. R. [Japanese Russian] wars.</p>
                <p>Cook san sent over milk for Tower &amp; myself.</p>
                <p>No heat allowed in rooms. Blackout every night.</p>
                <p>We're informed by Kencho that the J. Govt's policy had been decided now &amp; we
                    should all go to my house to livthe 5 of us as S. had left.</p>
                <p>So we went over &amp; on the way stopped in to get Mary O's things in Sokobin's
                    house &amp; some of his cellar. Carried our own things &amp; were accompanied by
                    guards. Scottie &amp; Roy stopped in their houses for a few things en route.
                    Left stuff &amp; went back to hotel for lunch &amp; rest of things.</p>
                <p>Woman from consular binding co. wanted pay for binding '40 correspondence. Told
                    her to see our rep when he was appointed. Hotel didn't ask for bill payment when
                    we left but we wouldn't have paid anyway. We had been ordered there by the J.
                    Gov't.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Back to my house &amp; settled in various rooms. Mary O. in back bedroom. Tower
                    in his. Me in mine. Roy in upper sunporch. Scott in living room on day bed
                    couch. [Later moved in with Tower]</p>
                <p>3 guards insisted on staying in house over Tower's protest &amp; quite a hot
                    scene but they would not stay outside. They appropriated the main large hall
                    &amp; made themselves at home.</p>
                <p>Excellent dinner of kidney beans, baked potatoes, mushrooms, celery &amp; pumpkin
                    pie. Grand after the stuff at the hotel.</p>
                <p>Bridge &amp; to bed.</p>
                <p>Paper says Swiss are to handle our interests.</p>
                <p>Fri. Dec. 12</p>
                <p>Scottie &amp; Roy went to houses for things &amp; Scottie saw his car &amp;
                    chauffeur.</p>
                <p>Kempei called to say he was sorry we were at war but that we would not be
                    maltreated personally &amp; they'd look after us &amp; facilitate everything
                    &amp; expected arrangements would be made to have us out in several weeks.</p>
                <p>I started packing for 2-3 hrs. every day rearranging things &amp; also reviewing
                    characters.</p>
                <p>Tried to get English papers sent to housChronicle, Osaka Mainichi &amp; Japan
                    Times and Advertiser. I translated the news every morning &amp; evening from the
                    J. press as it was ahead of that in the Chronicle which was the only English
                    paper we got &amp; that only through Scott's amah.</p>
                <p>Roy's old amah came in &amp; said she was in a bad way with rheumatism &amp;
                    wished to leave &amp; would get a new one. Scott's amah came over to help,
                    especially with marketing.</p>
                <p>My things &amp; Tower's at the house were untouched except for removal of RCA by
                    Prov.</p>
                <p>Scottie moved upstairs to Tower's room.</p>

                <p>Getting into routine of breakfast, news - walk in garden with Scottie, shoot a
                    bit of schulbak [sjoelbak is a type of Dutch shuffleboard which consists of each
                    player being given 3 chances to slide all the disks along a six foot table in an

                <p>Sun. Dec. 14</p>
                <p>Kempei called to ask how men are getting on. Asked if we might use tennis court
                    but he says no.</p>
                <p>News report of telephone interviews by J.C.G. in N.Y. with B.A. J. correspondent

                    that he was in charge of our interest and was going to Tokyo for further

                    extent of authority of our guards. Find they are for “protection” &amp;
                    supervision but we want them to keep in one place allotted if they are to be in
                    the house at all, as H. insists they must be. H. says Shu[?] will pay for their
                    food but we should supply beds &amp; coal. We object to supplying coal as they
                    are stationed in house by J. gov't which should provide.</p>
                <p>Also brought up about thefts of moving &amp; Scottie's liquor which will be

                    considered by Tokyo. Thought we'd be at least a month getting away &amp; might
                    go on Asama or Hakone [Japanese passenger liners]. Thought we couldn't take much
                    freight as there are 300 people. Davis appeared at window to surprise of us

                <p>Tower will insist that we all go to office, that no J. enter office as turnover
                    was illegal in first place &amp; he refuses to recognize J. gov't interference
                    as 1st turnover was under compulsion &amp; J. gov't is responsible for all

                    interpreter &amp; Shimohawa came at 10:30 am &amp; said Scott was waiting at
                    office, but T. made his points &amp; refused to go unless complied with.
                    Shimohawa said no hurry &amp; would report to his office. I don't think Tower
                    can assume any control over Scott's office.</p>
                <p>Tennis after none since Jan.</p>

                <p>Davis went to office &amp; merely witnessed J. handing over change of furniture
                    to de La Maine. His is promised that all staff can go to office on Monday. J.

                <p>My first stepping out tonight up to see Mac &amp; Davis. Scottie came up later.
                    Those fellows go all over. Guard came in shortly after I got there &amp; asked
                    who I was &amp; Alec said Mac has gone over to play cards at Davis' &amp; the
                    guard asked again &amp; Alec said Ginger had gone upstairs so the guard gave up.
                    Shortly after that the guard stuck his head in the room &amp; said goodnight but
                    Alec looked shortly afterwards &amp; the fellow had apparently left the
                    house.</p>
                <p>Had quite a reunion with Tingle &amp; Penson also there. Later I went to get Mac
                    at Davis' &amp; had an hour or so visit with M. &amp; Mrs. D. Mrs. Cooper Blythe
                    &amp; Mac.</p>
                <p>Back to Mac's house &amp; left for home about 12:30. Scottie &amp; Roy still up
                    holding the fort. Guards in bed &amp; no questions asked.</p>

                <p>Shimohawa told Mac it would probably be 2 mo. before we get away.</p>
                <p>We're getting silent treatment from Champoud who must be about fed up with trying
                    to get anything done.</p>
                <p>Early to bemakes one get up earlier.</p>
                <p>Mon. Feb. 9</p>
                <p>Fine day but no tennis as Br. went to their office. Accompanied by 5 police who
                    pried into everything they did in the office but let them take away what they
                    wanted.</p>
                <p>Barber finally came &amp; said he was stopped at door the other day. Mary &amp;
                    Roy to dentist.</p>
                <p>Mac, Ginger &amp; Alec called &amp; after being here about � hr. the maid came
                    iRoy's dumb one - &amp; took out the night screen &amp; informed her cop boy
                    friends of the biz &amp; they walked in on us &amp; chased the guests out. Quite
                    an argument &amp; the guards called Mac's guards in &amp; it seems they knew
                    abut the visit &amp; also pointed me out as having been up to Mac's. So our
                    guards faces were red.</p>
                <p>Tues. Feb. 10</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Hell to pay about last night visits &amp; long talk with guard about boredom of
                    staying in etc. Visit from Shimohawa &amp; they thought Tower had gone up to
                    Mac's but it was I so the expected spearing of T. failed. But I caught it for
                    fair &amp; could not go to tennis.</p>
                <p>I asked that the visits be regularized. Tower again asked that guards be kept out
                    of house. S. said if no turnover then nothing else will be permitted. No dope on
                    shipments. Nothing re elec. power. Said outside walks still being
                    considered.</p>
                <p>Roy's amah Yotch called &amp; she is finally coming 2/14 &amp; other dumb cluck
                    goes. Cook had lots of cheek about it all. Told T. that things should be
                    reported &amp; quite an argument but Roy &amp; Scott &amp; Mary too are fed up
                    with stalling. Scott is going to act on his own &amp; call Champoud. I drew up a
                    telegram for the Dept. via Champoud when he calls &amp; T. said it had some good
                    points to it but can see no need for any action but I said if he doesn't send it
                    I will, so will see. Roy is writing up to Tokyo, but it would be best to do
                    things through Tower.</p>
                <p>Damn if Ginger didn't appear at the window &amp; we did not let him in.</p>

                <p>Further newspaper talk of exch. in B.A. as J. Amb. there sounded them out, but
                    the Argentine is perhaps considering breaking off relations so that route may

                <p>Again trying to get Champoud. Situation becoming impossible as T. is ignoring
                    interests of all others involved &amp; trying to make martyr of self for
                    nothing. If it becomes necessary I shall ask Champoud to wire Emb. or Dept. T.
                    considers it impossible to comply with Dept. tel. instr. of - - - and refuses to
                    report why. Discussed this with Roy &amp; Scottie &amp; they think it might best
                    be toned down a bit. But agree the deadlock must be broken. Scottie trying to
                    get Champoud on his own.</p>
                <p>While I was playing chess with Mary something came up about Champoud &amp; Tower
                    burst out with “I forbid anyone under my jurisdiction from attempting to call
                    Champeau” &amp; so I asked what he proposed to do about the situation &amp; he
                    said “nothing” so I said that it was becoming intolerable &amp; I proposed to do
                    something about it.</p>
                <p>I composed a wire to be sent via the Kencho stating “Due to diff. with the J.
                    autho. T considers it impossible to hand[?] over to the Sw. Rep. or to comply
                    with various dept. instr. rec'd through him since the outbreak of the war and
                    meanwhile settlement of prob. regarding our and other American interests remains
                    at a standstill.” I showed it to Tower &amp; said that unless he were willing to
                    do something about the situation I should endeavor to get something accomplished
                    by sending this wire. There were plenty hot arguments &amp; we all joined in
                    &amp; got him to agree to call for Champoud by Sat. &amp; send a message unless
                    C. had turned up in the meantime. T. pulled some nasty crackesp. to Roy about
                    “Grow Up” but he has been under strain &amp; fortunately Roy let it pass. I told
                    T. that none of us has a monopoly of the brains &amp; rather than harbor
                    something vitally affecting all of us he should discuss it. The atmosphere
                    cleared considerably &amp; I got my object accomplished.</p>

                <p>Ch. calls with Shimohawa &amp; an interpreter &amp; guard sits in too. Ch. gives

                    Club] bills. All goes on the books. Scottie got money from Rialto for sale of
                    furniture. No word yet about freight. Roy gave Ch. letter to Nakusan[?] about
                    it.</p>

                <p>Tower started to give Ch. his letter with telegram &amp; news of conv. of Feb. 5
                    re handover &amp; Shimohawa told interpreter to take it which he diout of Ch.
                    hands. Tower asked if he were being refused right to hand message to his rep.
                    &amp; was told the Kencho would have to examine it first. Tower got the instr.
                    whereby one is permitted to send messages direct through the Swiss consul but it
                    cut no ice. Sh. was rather perplexed by the situation but insisted on retaining
                    the letter even if it were addressed to Champoud. T. said the Tokyo authorities
                    would of course examine the message before it left Japan but he couldn't concede
                    these find the right to take it away from the Swiss Consul.</p>
                <p>Re handing over, Ch. said he daily expected instructions &amp; would let us know
                    as soon as they came.</p>
                <p>Sh. said we get elec. power by 2/16 &amp; delay caused by tech. diff. in appl. as

                    it daily &amp; can now figure out some things that were greek to me before. Have
                    also gone through the 400 character cards twicfirst time finished Xmas and 2nd

                    under these 3 div. have 3 more namely easy, medium &amp; difficult to remember
                    the readings &amp; meanings from looking at the characters. Then I review the

                <p>Stopped up again for the last couple of days &amp; had to take salts to loosen

                <p>Roy's amah Yotch supposed to show up for work Saturday. Found out she'd come Fri
                    to say she wasn't coming to work &amp; the cops had perhaps scared her off
                    again. Damndest situation. Will probably have to see about getting someone
                    else.</p>
                <p>Monday Feb. 16</p>
                <p>Singapore unconditionally surrenders. A great blow for our side. Looks like the
                    Japanese are marching through everything. P.M. [Prime Minister] Tojo is to make
                    an important nat'l policy announcement today. Perhaps that the J's will be
                    satisfied with what they've got. I wonder.</p>
                <p>Our initial mistake was in evidently bluffinKnox &amp; others brash statements
                    and in not having anything to back up that bluff.</p>
                <p>Second big mistake was in not being ready to meet a surprise attack for which
                    these Indians are famous.</p>
                <p>There will probably be plenty more mistakes before we start doing things
                    right.</p>
                <p>But there is plenty of historical precedent for carving out Empires &amp;
                    Britain's may be dead &amp; J. in the ascendancy. Don't think Britain will be
                    able to hold together. Wouldn't be surprised at revolts in India. And China
                    can't do much if J. chooses to clean her up. J. will try to consolidate her
                    positions &amp; while she has shot the works &amp; won so far she'll try to rest
                    a bit before going on. Will we be strong enough to prevent her from restinby
                    attacking from the north &amp; with long range bombers. We must get busy.</p>

                <p>Guard announced that Tower's frt. is c/o ACG in Shanghai &amp; Roy's is at Toa
                    Kim there. No word re mine. A break in the dam - &amp; we may expect more
                    now.</p>
                <p>Roy went over to watch tennis &amp; saw the fellows. They go to Osaka tomorrow.
                    Our Suzuki Non[?] old fellow [#1 Japanese in Kobe consulate] got the same as M

                <p>Tonight's paper announces that Welles says an agreement has finally been reached

                <p>Wed. Feb. 18</p>
                <p>Taylor at tennis &amp; not so hot.</p>
                <p>Mac et. al. sent down for some liquid supplies which Scottie furnished. They are
                    all out. Bridge in the eve.</p>
                <p>Saw Pencook[?] &amp; wife &amp; _______pass by but could only wave.</p>
                <p>Thurs. Feb. 19</p>
                <p>Guards announced I was to go to Kencho at then 8:3so I went &amp; there we waited
                    around &amp; no one seemed to know why I had been called &amp; decided it was a
                    mistake. So Matsumoto said he has some things to see us about &amp; came back
                    with guard &amp; me. Think to get me to say things about T. on way but no
                    success. They said he was moto[?] kurien[?] I said that they needn't expect me
                    to say anything about T. anymore than they would about their chief &amp; they
                    dropped the subject. Then decided to call at Champeau's house &amp; find they
                    expected him to be there &amp; they told maid to tell him to come to my place.
                    Then M. said I'd been to Sam's for farewell to Fred &amp; Mac &amp; asked what
                    I'd said to J. as if I'd remember at this date. Asked what of it &amp; he asked
                    me to think hard as it was important but I couldn't make out what it was all
                    about anyway. Furthermore they have no right to question us &amp; such stuff can
                    be ignored.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>At the house Champeau arrived shortly after M. had told us about frt. [freight]
                    mine in Manila or Jaffre Dec. 6. Damn! We'll have to get Champeau to send it
                    back. [There have been previous references to this freight in this diary. If I
                    remember correctly from reading other documents that Daddy saved, most boxes
                    were ransacked and looted in Manila, a few boxes did eventually make it to
                    California and Daddy filed to get insurance reimbursemenhe eventually did get a
                    little reimbursement.]</p>
                <p>Champeau said he had word from Tokyo that the Swiss Min [Minister] saw no
                    objection to J. being present at turnover &amp; T. said if Ch. ordered this T.
                    would go but Ch. would only say it was the accepted custom. Anyway T. agreed to
                    go &amp; that after lunch. Ch. said T. could protest if anything amiss.</p>
                <p>All of us went down &amp; were met there by some 10 Japanese officials. The front
                    door showed evidences of having been opened. Inside we nearly got hung up over
                    this handing over but finally got started &amp; found all listed there but desks
                    etc. had obviously been rifled &amp; Scottie's had much stuff missing &amp; seal
                    gone from safe. Stuff he had definitely left there like 2 lbs. coffee &amp; a
                    felt hat &amp; plenty of pencils &amp; stationery were gone when he entered his
                    room this time. Plenty of entrances possible. We all cleared out our desks &amp;
                    brought away several suitcases of personal things &amp; nothing searched at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Found Shima. [probably Shimamoto] had moved to Akashi &amp; working there.</p>
                <p>Miss Yesunega [mentioned at beginning] showed up at last moment &amp; got some
                    stuff but Scottie hardly had chance to speak to her. I had [?] at house &amp;
                    believe she wants to go but everything is vague.</p>
                <p>Walked back to house arriving about 4 p.m.</p>
                <p>Brought back lots of stuff.</p>
                <p>Fri. Feb. 20</p>
                <p>T. Scottie &amp; I went to office this a.m. after holdup which looked like no go.
                    I sorted out Dusty's things which T. &amp; Champeau &amp; Gudinak checked
                    records against inventory cards.</p>
                <p>Brought back lots of stuff at noon &amp; repacked Dusty's things to take back
                    again for Champeau to take to Tokyo.</p>
                <p>I spent the p.m. destroying seals etc. &amp; it sounded like an iron foundry but
                    the one guard kept to himself out in hall &amp; read &amp; asked no questions.
                    Would have told him it was simply stuff we weren't handing over to the
                    Swiss.</p>

                <p>Tower &amp; Gudinak checked records.</p>
                <p>Brought back lots of Sam's things.</p>
                <p>This is the day I had picked for sailing but its way ofthe maids were on me,
                    however &amp; had some bridge.</p>

                    checked records while I cut up stamps, etc.</p>
                <p>In P.M,. T. &amp; Roy went down &amp; finished most of checking. Roy turned over
                    Masonic Records to G. to go to Bossert. Am. Asian records to stay with Cons.
                    stuff. Brought back some pp. [passports] &amp; fee stamps &amp; burned them
                    fifty grand worth up the flue. T. tried working out acct. but needs Dusty's

                    further about application. Looks fishy to me but T. &amp; I are to go after

                <p>Plenty booming from time to time today. Probably testing defense.</p>
                <p>Champoud &amp; his sec. showed up but C. has no news from 8 days in Tokyo. A
                    reticent fellow but doesn't think the exchange will be soon. Damn it all. I
                    still hope we get away by end of April as I feel we'll see fireworks if here
                    this summer.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Put in another appl. for �5M for Jan &amp; Feb. living exp.</p>
                <p>Roy is to go to Shioya tomorrow.</p>
                <p>All the war prisoners are being made to pay $1 per �1. Hot stuff.</p>
                <p>Looks like Java is going. Damn, but still Bataan holds out. Great stuff there.
                    We've got to come out on top.</p>
                <p>S?sho is going easier.</p>
                <p>Ground defrosting so no tennis.</p>
                <p>Thurs. March 5</p>
                <p>Roy got out to Shioya O.K. &amp; brought back dumbbells &amp; iron boots. Rained
                    all day so no one went with him. He arranged about sale of his stuff with Rialto
                    &amp; hope we can all do likewise.</p>
                <p>Fischer of Bremer Wood showed up. He is restricted in movements bet. house in
                    Shioya (Holden's) &amp; office &amp; must get permits to go elsewhere. Goes to
                    C.A. once a week &amp; uses our pool[?] out there. Found I've missed 1 mo. rent
                    so there goes another �250. Bathroom leak finally fixed.</p>
                <p>We destroyed 708 old pp. on 2/22.</p>
                <p>Local papers say all Jap nisei are being moved 150 mi. from Pacific coast.</p>
                <p>Tonight's paper carries acct. of attack by 30 Am. planes on Nan Shoto 2 M Km. SE
                    of Honshu &amp; appearance of a plane off Honshu this A.M. &amp; air raid alarm
                    in Tokyo at 8:09:15 AM but nothing but warnings, no raids accomplished according
                    to papers.</p>
                <p>Also tonight's paper carries acct. of the sailing soon of 2 vessels (Brazilian)
                    from Rio, one to Lisbon &amp; the other to Lorenzo Marques with 852 Axis natls
                    inc. 164 J. so our guard's solicitousness about selling our things or packing
                    soon maybe has some backing.</p>
                <p>Fri. March 6</p>
                <p>A beautiful morning and warmer than the warmest midday so far.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Spent P.M. in sorting out things for sale &amp; repacking. Scottie went to his
                    office this A.M. to get payroll fixed &amp; says Guthnecht will be over tomorrow
                    &amp; that Rialto has got permit for an auction of our things &amp; is making up
                    a list of prices etc.</p>
                <p>Guards asked T. &amp; me to go over to Dusty's to fix up things so the snail does
                    move apace. Paper says exch. has been agreed upon in principle so actual
                    carrying out may be way off.</p>
                <p>Sat. March 7</p>
                <p>Colder &amp; cloudy.</p>
                <p>To Sokobin's in P.M. with Mary &amp; guard &amp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. DeSilva &amp;
                    their J. showed up to take Sokobin's inventory with Mary &amp; Miss Yesunega.
                    Latter has seen her folks &amp; decided to stay in J. Ch. &amp; Guthnecht showed
                    up &amp; had new instr. re things we can taknamely only personal effects in
                    things with handles &amp; no furniture. So that will mean we'll have to store or
                    sell things &amp; no insurance for war risk or breakage is possible.</p>
                <p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. de Silva busy so couldn't go over to Dusty'that'll be Monday.</p>
                <p>Ch. called at 6 P.M. &amp; is to go to Mukden Mon. Roy &amp; Tower gave him dope
                    re their shipments in Shanghai but mine in Manila is out of luck. Maybe go
                    later.</p>
                <p>Colder tonight. Heavy practice this A.M.</p>
                <p>Sunday March 8</p>
                <p>Tennis for 1st time in week. Bridge in evening.</p>
                <p>Mon. March 9</p>
                <p>No Eng. papers Monday so I read the J. press for the others.</p>
                <p>Heavy practice this A.M. Heave hoers on outside.</p>
                <p>Went to Dusty's in P.M. &amp; maid not very helpful about showing us things.
                    Acted as though all was hers. Found she still has Dusty's liquor there &amp;
                    nothing done about refrigeration so had her arrange to see Joyce at shop &amp;
                    find out dope. Wrote to Dusty about the situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Joyce came back to house &amp; Scottie, Roy &amp; I signed appls. for holding an
                    auction. If that can't be held then Joyce thinks she can sell the stuff
                    piecemeal at the shop.</p>
                <p>Java falls. When will this stop.</p>
                <p>Tues. March 10</p>
                <p>No Guthnecht yesterday or today. No tennis as still too wet.</p>
                <p>Wed. Mar 11</p>
                <p>Tennis &amp; summer weather today.</p>
                <p>Cook on a buying spree agaigot �40 of meat on 3rd &amp; 10th. Also put down 5 lb.
                    butter (�3) &amp; only brought home 4.</p>
                <p>Thurs. Mar 12</p>
                <p>Tennis again &amp; warm. Read over some old letters of college days &amp; found
                    them pretty amusing after all these years. What one takes seriously in those
                    days loses its serious side at this date.</p>
                <p>Fri. Mar 13</p>
                <p>Cook came in for jack &amp; told him to take it out of the money he owes on
                    missing canned goods. That started a knockdown drag out &amp; gave him figures
                    to show how he had been robbing us &amp; he of course got indignant. The guard
                    came in to be helpful &amp; didn't get far as he didn't know what it was all
                    about but the cook demanded to have the Kencho authorities after I told him he
                    could either quit or be fired. I fired him but he didn't want to be fired.
                    Making too much. So I told the cop to call the boys.</p>
                <p>Missed tennis but worth it.</p>
                <p>Matsumoto &amp; Shimohawa came &amp; I explained &amp; they asked why they had
                    been called &amp; I said I didn't call them &amp; cop said cook had &amp; they
                    &amp; I agreed it was none of their business but suggested I fire cook &amp; I
                    said I was willing to forget canned goods losses of �200 or so &amp; despite
                    that they said I should pay him retirement bonus. But it is worth it getting rid
                    of the nuisance of having him around.</p>
                <p>Showed them how he has been making money on us &amp; they took slip with
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Then took up other subjects &amp; M. harped on payment of Tor hotel bill but T.
                    maintains it is J. gov't lookout as we were sent there by their orders &amp;
                    they want us to pay bill &amp; if U.S. gov't does same they will repay later. We
                    said if we got some action on our numerous requests we may reconsider the
                    question.</p>
                <p>Also took up about elec. power &amp; S. says permission was granted but he
                    understood we didn't want the power. Sannomiya grants permits. Also asked about
                    walks but no dope yet.</p>
                <p>Also asked about selling stuff &amp; says permit to sell will be granted. Also
                    about giving up other houses &amp; can do when furniture is sold.</p>
                <p>Also about stuff in customs &amp; that may be possible.</p>
                <p>Also about sailing &amp; that may be at end of April &amp; 500 already
                    booked.</p>
                <p>Also about stuff takeable &amp; that will be only articles for daily use. Rest to
                    be sent later. Damn.</p>
                <p>They suggested a cocktail party &amp; we said fine if they get stuff out of
                    customs.</p>
                <p>M. &amp; S. spoke to cook &amp; I imagine gave him plenty hell &amp; he'll
                    probably have to buy bonds now.</p>
                <p>Called Tokei-san (Scottie's amah) in to cook &amp; told cook I'd settle with him
                    when kitchen things straightened up. I consented that he use rooms until he can
                    find another house &amp; move.</p>
                <p>All relieved to be rid of cook as he got too much graft.</p>
                <p>Sat. March 14</p>
                <p>Checked the kitchen things &amp; found most of them there &amp; paid off the cook
                    with no bonus &amp; no letter of recommendation. Told him to keep out of kitchen
                    as Tokei san is in charge now &amp; asked him to get another house as soon as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>In the future in hiring a cook check with him or her the list of kitchen things
                    as responsibility is established. Lock up canned goods &amp; dole them out as
                    asked for. No free access until confidence is established.</p>
                <p>Sun. March 15</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Tower's sailing date. Too wet for tennis today too. Told guard I want cook out of
                    the house soon &amp; he agreed.</p>
                <p>Mon. March 16</p>
                <p>Cold again but cleared up. Cleaned out the garden fish pond &amp; put 6 buckets
                    of muck in the garden for fertilizer. Goldfish from Sokobin's.</p>
                <p>Singles with Tingle. Saw de la Maine &amp; Rodriguez &amp; they say we sail at
                    end of April. Br. are now asking exchange of all civilians.</p>
                <p>Guthnecht called. Said he had been refused permission for a week &amp; had to
                    take up matter with Tokyo although the J. recog. right to call but always raise
                    excuses. Say they don't trust T. so he can't go see people paid off &amp; some
                    can't be locateold S. &amp; Shinsei[?]</p>
                <p>Baggage limits now down to what one person can carrsubject to 2 interpretations
                    &amp; probably means we can take only what we can carry ourselves. These swine.
                    We've reportedly refused to reply to this J. proposal.</p>
                <p>Roy believes that if we don't sail by July we're here for the duration &amp; that
                    is a possibility.</p>
                <p>Asked G. to have Rialto call &amp; also arrange about packing things.</p>
                <p>Tues. March 17</p>
                <p>St. Patrick's Day &amp; Mac is having a party today to which we're invited but as
                    usual won't be present.</p>
                <p>Showed[?] wielden[?] this A.M. &amp; told me it appears likely we'll be able to
                    get stuff from customs &amp; that our 2 week old appl. for Jan. &amp; Feb.
                    expenses for �3M is being approved. Said it was not unreasonable that we fired
                    the grafting cook.</p>
                <p>Spoke to guards about going to Mac's &amp; they said officially they couldn't
                    permit us to do so &amp; anyway not all of us. I said how about Scottie &amp; me
                    going &amp; they said formally they must refusbut .... So Scottie &amp; I went
                    out to “view the moon.” it was raininso got in on Mac's party in full swinabout
                    10:30 the guard said they were looking for us so Scott &amp; I went homa

                <p>Shimohawa called &amp; bank has granted permits to sell our stuff. Also we can
                    get things through customs by paying duty.</p>
                <p>Paper says the Swedish ship Dorttningold [Drottningholm] left N.Y. Mon 16 with

                    any hurry to settle.</p>
                <p>Ginger's birthday &amp; the Br. are all celebrating plenty.</p>
                <p>March 1Thurs. Summer weather</p>
                <p>Told guards again I want cook to move bag &amp; baggage shortly as his week of
                    grace is up tomorrow. They agreed &amp; said also they had been taken in by him
                    &amp; he had sold them sugar &amp; rice rations for this month &amp; Tokei was
                    giving them her rice &amp; could we spare sugar. I had a good laugh at them.</p>
                <p>Matsumoto called to say Scott can't get Daley's stuff but I told him again Scott
                    has Daley's P/A [Power of Attorney] &amp; it finally sunk in.</p>
                <p>No tennis today with shoulder sore &amp; others not playing anyway.</p>
                <p>Fri. March 20 Summer weather.</p>
                <p>Again asked guards to get cook out today &amp; they said they'd speak to him but
                    it might be a few days &amp; please be patient. We've all had enough of the
                    fellow in the house.</p>
                <p>Telephone &amp; gas collections called but we told them no money from bank &amp;
                    cannot pay them either.</p>
                <p>Mino of Toyo Cluse[?] called about clearing Scott's Daley's &amp; my things &amp;
                    says it will take about a month. We said to hurry it up as it will do us no good
                    coming that late.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>Guthnecht called about various matters &amp; had him stay for luncour 2nd guest
                    since confinement. Arranged to go to office next Tues. to pay off staff. They
                    won't let T. go as consider he has bad intentions!</p>
                <p>Joyce called &amp; said stuff can be moved to Scottie's Monday &amp; Roy arr. to
                    have his brought in from Shioya tomorrow. Joyce gets things done. Says we'll
                    know Monday about auction or not.</p>
                <p>Sat. Mar. 21</p>
                <p>Spring Equinox &amp; a fine day.</p>
                <p>Started fixing things up for the salrepairing water heater &amp; stoves &amp;
                    broken furniture. Getting things sorted out &amp; arranged. Worked all day &amp;
                    Scottie got some mint[?] brought over from his house &amp; we had mint[?] in
                    lime juice cordials &amp; played records &amp; Mesayo &amp; Yesunega dropped in
                    &amp; so we had our first dance of the confinement. Scottie &amp; I finally
                    decided not to go up to see Mac so didn't ask guards.</p>
                <p>Sun. Mar 22</p>
                <p>Worked all day fixing things up &amp; plenty of work to do. Skipped tennis again.
                    Fixed a number of things that needed fixing around the house. Got out outboard
                    &amp; its in fine shape after 8 yrs. in box.</p>
                <p>Mon. Mar 23</p>
                <p>Movers came &amp; helped get stuff over to Scotties for the sale.</p>
                <p>Joyce called &amp; said auction will not be allowed &amp; things must be sold at
                    fixed prices. Kobe is only place they won't allow an auction but selling
                    straight is better I think. Decided to get rid of Xmas things but have saved out
                    clothes &amp; shoes for gift to American prisoneralso baby things. Cop says Mrs.

                    &amp; Shimamotin Hiroshima. Cops chased them away saying they had no word of
                    them coming &amp; tel. Shimohawa at Ken. who said send them down there. Then
                    Champoud &amp; Guthnecht came &amp; we again raised hell with the dumb guards as
                    Matsumoto had authorized the visit to get the staff pd. off. This set of guards
                    is worse than useless - obstructionists. So we waited for staff to come
                    back.</p>

                <p>Champoud said Tillman's wife had reported from Manila that all frt. on wharves
                    had been destroyed inc. their things which were with mine so that looks like the
                    finis of all our good things. Tough break but eventually we can replace most
                    except for the Shonsi? [Shogi?] screen &amp; chest.</p>

                <p>Staff came back &amp; signed payroll forms. Janitor Shimo got somewhat uppity
                    &amp; wanted more money but we said sign or else you don't even get this amt.
                    Also asked him to bring back office bike &amp; asked about liquor bases[?] &amp;

                <p>Joyce called in at noon to say sale is going O.K. &amp; Champoud had tried to
                    throw his weight around saying Scottie's things are more his than Scotties &amp;
                    he'd stop the sale if she didn't give him curtains he wanted. Was a regular
                    cad.</p>
                <p>Mary said Ch. had tried to pull fast ones at Sam's over linen etc. &amp; got her

                <p>Packer Toki Yani came &amp; packed refrigerator &amp; camphor chest. Has to wait
                    10 days for more materialvery difficult to get now. He advises shipping to Tokyo
                    as local warehouses are expensive &amp; liable to be hit.</p>

                <p>Outboard people crossed[?] &amp; came to buy at �400 after I'd agreed to 350. Saw

                    he gave us 8 bottles liquor &amp; maid said she sent rest to Tokyo. Alas said
                    Shima. had pilfered 3 pr. shoes &amp; clothes. Said to give Servel to Swiss to
                    sell. She listed Dusty's things with Mary. Said we'd take all possible.</p>
                <p>Told Joyce to see about selling Affeld's Servel for about �2M to settle his
                    debts. Also asked about sale of mine.</p>
                <p>The Champ. called &amp; interview strained over this Scott biz &amp; lack of
                    action. I asked for receipts for things sent to Am. We said bills unsettled when
                    we leave will remain unsettled as we have no P/A's. He wanted us to put money in
                    Am. Cons. acct. &amp; that will be O.K. if we can get from private accts to
                    Cons. acct. Plenty of biz will be unfinished when we leave, but none of us trust
                    that fellow.</p>
                <p>Permits &amp; PearlFinally the Champ filled out those appl. after 10 days but
                    we'd got fed up &amp; asked Joyce to do likewise today. But let it stand as she
                    may yet do fastegetting the jack.</p>
                <p>We plan to get some pearls with surplus casif any.</p>

                <p>No tennis as all busy at Br. with sale.</p>
                <p>Champeau &amp; Tillmann called &amp; had delivered things to Am. internes &amp;
                    talked with them for 1st time. They want meat as they are not fish eaters. Also
                    wish to prepare own food if given materialbut now supplied through Miyako
                    Restaurant by Kencho &amp; food is lousy. Also badly crowde23 beds in 1 room.
                    Lack clothing, glassware, plates, etc. Have very little. Both places have Vics
                    so can use records. One Am. died of pneumonia at B&amp;S dora man who had been
                    in Guam 30 yrs. They get 1 piece of bread a day each.</p>
                <p>Rialto had given Champ the money appl. we had given them to fill out. Worse
                    luck.</p>
                <p>Champ snooty about buying things &amp; got Tillman to get Roy's thingsheets,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>Guard rudely chased Champ out after an hour saying he didn't know what Osaka
                    allowed but here an hr. for conference wouldn't be allowed. The guards are down
                    on Champ too.</p>
                <p>He arranged to see Sam's things this A.M.</p>

                <p>Raining for 1st time in a week.</p>
                <p>Joyce dropped in to say someone may be interested in the Servel. Hope so as I
                    think shipping may damage it.</p>
                <p>CarpenteTokcalled to say other boxes will be ready Mondawanted to make 12 new
                    ones, but after argument agreed to use my old ones. A lot they care about using

                <p>Turned cold in afternoon.</p>
                <p>Champeau called but has no news about sailing plans. He goes to Moji this weekend
                    to meet his family steaming[?] from Manila via Taihoku. He's trying to buy
                    Sokobin &amp; other things cheap. Says that Kenta[?] still claims we owe him �
                    mo. rent for leaving things there. But he took that chance on chance I'd take
                    house. Anyway it's up to Bruner as I never got the gas geyser.</p>

                <p>Finally got Tillman's up &amp; Roy got his cash drawn out of bank.</p>
                <p>Mine has been three weeks in the process. Till says Champ is ill having had flu.
                    Guth is over packing Osaka. No luck on books yet. No more news re sailing.</p>

                    battleship &amp; Br. lost Warsprite [British battleship] in Coral Sea battle.

                <p>So comfort bags are to go to prisoners in U.S. &amp; be ready by May 25. Looks
                    like we'll really get going this time. Also the Drottningholm finally sailed 5/7
                    for Lisbon. Some progress.</p>

                <p>Arg. Cons. Rodriguez back from T. says we sail the 10th of June. I certainly hope
                    so, honey, as we will have been separated more than a year by the time I see you
                    again. How I do miss you and the children.</p>

                <p>Thurs. May 14. Grand day.</p>
                <p>So Br. exch. ship the Rio de Platte has left B.A. for N.O. [New Orleans] &amp;
                    Eire to pick up J. dips. in those places &amp; go to L.M. So some more progress
                    is evident.</p>
                <p>Started sunbathing but the sun is very weak.</p>
                <p>Tennis singles with Mrs. D. as Lemon[?] &amp; the Champ showed up just as we were
                    to begin. Champ finally took charge of Br. int. Lemon thinks he is to go with
                    us. Champ very poorly after the flu which Guthnecht &amp; Glendsire[?] have
                    caught.</p>
                <p>Champ then called on us to say we are to leave bet. June 15-15 &amp; arr. L.M.
                    July 10-15. This is the 1st official sailing news we have had from our side
                    &amp; it looks fairly O.K. we all hope so.</p>

                <p>Fri. May 15. Cool &amp; fine day.</p>
                <p>Scottie played tennis in A.M. with Mac, Penson &amp; Alec Taylor.</p>
                <p>German Consul Reid moving to Shioya. He's always moving either from countries or
                    houses it seems.</p>
                <p>Reading Indiscreet Letters from Pekina story of the Boxer Siege &amp; what a tale
                    of incompetence &amp; tragedy. Apparently written by a Dutchman, though
                    anonymous.</p>
                <p>Tennis in P.M. with Tingle &amp; Davis.</p>
                <p>So we sank a steamer in the E. Ch. Sea night of the 8th &amp; plenty lost. Might
                    it have been Conal [?]</p>
                <p>Also seems that some of those planes over a month ago went on to Ch. &amp; Russia
                    &amp; they now only think that 2 must have fallen near Japan. Then what was the
                    one they exhibited in T.</p>
                <p>So the Dutch are being shot for having radios in D.E.I.</p>
                <p>Heard Col. Sharpe over radio last night from Mindanao. Those fellows might better
                    keep their traps shut.</p>
                <p>Sunbathed again. Lobster for lunch &amp; good too. Pretty tough.</p>
                <p>See you in N.Y. Aug 12 honey. It's a date &amp; what a one!</p>
                <p>Sat. May 16. Grand day.</p>
                <p>Tower to office to fix up some at questions of the Swiss. Packing going on &amp;
                    things to be sent to T. when we leave.</p>

                <p>Sunbathed &amp; got reddened a bit.</p>
                <p>Roy &amp; Scottie tennised in A.M. &amp; I in p.m.</p>
                <p>Those Indiscreet Letters are certainly revealinnothing new in looting being done
                    by J. though R. wants to see same happen here.</p>
                <p>Asked guards to go shopping to buy pearls to give Liquori for liquor.</p>
                <p>Sun. May 17</p>
                <p>Cloudy &amp; cool &amp; others played tennis but I worked on Japanese, also began
                    Plutarch's Lives for the umpteenth time. Much of the stuff drags but some fast

                <p>Mesayo sent Kihon Kanji from Yoko. Glad to get that &amp; will try for more.</p>
                <p>Frogs legs for dinner.</p>
                <p>Eye bathing again. Damn!</p>

                <p>Went down to see Liquori but he's in Tokyo for 10 days so no pearls yet.</p>
                <p>Roy &amp; Scottie went shopping &amp; called at Rialto too - had strawberries
                    &amp; cream &amp; told them to get up lists of things on hand as we want to get
                    settled before we go.</p>
                <p>Guthnecht called re permits etc. Gave him 4 gin 4 bourbon for J.A. [John Allison]

                <p>Shimohawa called to say we are to sail June 9 from Yoko on the Asama
                    MarHurrah!</p>
                <p>However the Kencho has fooled us before on the sailing date but he thinks this is

                <p>Paper says we are to be exch. in L.M. on July 1Germans &amp; Italians arrived
                    Lisbon so things are moving.</p>
                <p>Melongood too for dessert. We can begin using canned goods to the hilt now.</p>
                <p>Asked for the Swiss again to get things settle up. Shimohawa says Ch. is useless
                    on Br. interests too.</p>
                <p>Mover called &amp; we settled on moving things for the sale.</p>
                <p>Chokai around again trying to collect Chokai fees from last July. Told them

                <p>Asked for Guthnecht to get consular biz. wound up.</p>
                <p>Kencho cops came to see Roy about his accts. &amp; sale of furnitura bother.

                <p>Tennis doubles. Balls giving out.</p>
                <p>Scottie thinks chaos will reign here when things wind up.</p>

                    &amp; stay at New Grand [Hotel in Yokohama] pending sailing on the 9th. The
                    sooner the better, honey, &amp; it looks like I'll be seeing you &amp; the kids
                    now before many moons. This separation has been terrific honey &amp; the sooner
                    we are reunited the better for us.</p>
                <p>Char. cards finished by writer &amp; soon I'll have to write them up. Well

                    Bob Haushier] just from Tokyo knows nothing about sailing the 9th of June.</p>
                <p>Champ. &amp; Guth. called &amp; they have no word about sailing so perhaps the
                    kencho is fooling us agaibut why? Damn.</p>
                <p>Will purchase silk thru Guth.</p>
                <p>Scottie says [?] one of the few lang. students who has done anything with J. but
                    it is still a long ways [?] good.</p>
                <p>Again asked Champ. to take stuff to the German prisoner6 weeks now. He's
                    interested in Affeld's Servel at 1800. Also in all remaining liquor which we
                    have none.</p>
                <p>Hirside 1 1/2 hr. radio &amp; newspaper blast has backed the J. birds but they
                    are moving slowly now.</p>
                <p>Bill L. [Bill Lackie] got 4 yrs. Damn Shame.</p>
                <p>Sat. May 23. Fine day &amp; warmer</p>
                <p>Guards announced this a.m. that we are to leave June 3; 8:55 a.m. for Yoko to
                    await sailing June 9 at the New Grand. Only 3 pc. small baggage to be allowed.
                    We told them an announcement through them doesn't mean a thing.</p>
                <p>Br. were told same things &amp; Davis sent Ginger down to Champ. asking what the

                <p>Went over to AM tennis &amp; we all think this latest gag is a bunch of tripjust
                    part of the kencho policy of ribbing us.</p>

                    up alone in this place &amp; hell raised when we try to see our friends.</p>
                <p>Tried to go up hill tonight but guards refused again even though I pointed out
                    article which they had read. They said J. is diff. &amp; how diff. it is, but
                    eventually we'll get these gorotskies.</p>

                <p>Mon. May 25</p>
                <p>Guards started day with outburst against T. &amp; told him to ask Champ. if he
                    wanted to see Hasegawa.</p>
                <p>Sourpus &amp; pimples played ball in our walk &amp; J. went to stop them &amp;
                    nearly got in a fight. I told them to remember they were here for our protection
                    &amp; not to fight us. They refused to move &amp; plenty talk was all.</p>
                <p>I. Kandu of Chokai called to urge me to pay Chokai fee from July, 1941 to end of
                    Ma3% of rent �750 monthly. Told him there was no reason to give money to help J.
                    fight the war as we are enemies now. He said the fees are used for schools,
                    cleaning shrines, etc. &amp; not mil. but I know they sponsor anti Am. meetings
                    etc. Said Fr &amp; Ger have pd &amp; I said they are big allies &amp; rest are
                    enemies. Said also it's a mutual arrangement that J. consuls in U.S. don't pay
                    such a fee &amp; he said he didn't know about that but J. is diff. also not all
                    from Consulate but only for us privately. I said we wouldn't pay &amp; he
                    left.</p>
                <p>Br. now hear we can send 3 trunks &amp; take all we can carry the day we go but
                    nothing yet from Champeaa damn mess &amp; they'll try to stick us.</p>

                <p>T. asked to see Kern alone but got nowhere as Hirsoka thought they'd have

                <p>We found out anyway that the Gairnsho is paying hotel expenses except for liquor.

                <p>John asked about payment for his licensed radio but that went astray until J. had

                <p>Snoozed most of p.m. with this rotten cold. Went to bed right after dinner
                    again.</p>
                <p>Mon. June 8</p>
                <p>Kern supposed to show up at 9 to get our requests about baggage etc. but didn't
                    come. Just as well.</p>
                <p>The Sp. Min. [Spanish Minister] showed up last eve to talk with “Hose [Warner
                    spelling of Jose] Chan” as the J. paged[?] Chihan &amp; they were surrounded by
                    6 cops so the Min. called them [?] &amp; left in high dudgeon without talking to
                    Chihan.</p>
                <p>Fellows said the cops again tried to chase them out of social hall early as
                    Joyce[?] (Chamberlain) Toda[?] was in hotel. He had arr. at 5 pm yesterday &amp;
                    that was excuse for chasing us all out of music room.</p>
                <p>Trying to get down to bookstores but not much progress.</p>

                <p>Saw Tom Davis of N.C.B. staying at Centre Hotel &amp; he is going with us. He has
                    to keep diary from police.</p>
                <p>Lunch rather scanty &amp; quickly down. Walked in park after lunch &amp; we are
                    quite the object of curiosity especially of a gang of toughs.</p>
                <p>New Swiss rep Klinglebacker showed up &amp; took dope about baggage. He at least
                    made sense.</p>
                <p>Saw Stan who says the guy who went down to my old apartment was done [?] in da
                    eyes &amp; joined da fisher[?] down[?] names[?] from Stan[?]. So he won't be wid
                    us. Tough luck.</p>
                <p>Swiss also say we are to sail the 17th so we're holding our own now.</p>
                <p>Lots of civilians arr. from Kobe dist. yesterday &amp; staying at Bund hotel.</p>

                <p>Social eve of bridge or rather oh hell &amp; rummy &amp; Weatherby &amp; I played
                    chess &amp; took 1 game each.</p>
                <p>The latins stepping out tonight with the police. However, none of that stuff for
                    me with my honey waiting for me to cross the deep. It won't be long now honey
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>Tues. June 9. Cloudy</p>
                <p>Plenty planes maneuvering[?] overhead. No. J. paper this morning as “too many J.
                    guests in hotel.</p>
                <p>Internment biz in J. busy. Stooges in all camps &amp; men have hard time of

                <p>Cold somewhat better.</p>
                <p>Walked on roof in a.m. but pretty cloudy.</p>
                <p>Maple tried to get to Dr. to complete his vaccinations etc. but was refused.
                    Scottie &amp; I tried to buy stamps but no luck.</p>
                <p>After lunch went to park for walk &amp; saw a few foreigners.</p>

                <p>On ret. to hotel grounds permitted shopping in hotel &amp; I ordered a S?sho book
                    &amp; some stamps.</p>
                <p>Portuguese Min. called on Mangelhoerns &amp; says we sail 17th &amp; Embassies
                    are sending down cases for ship tomorrow.</p>
                <p>Played “oh hell” in eve.</p>
                <p>Wed. June 10 Fine day &amp; warm.</p>
                <p>Cold much better today &amp; put on shorts as it looks hot.</p>
                <p>Walked on roof after breakfast.</p>
                <p>Sp. Min. called on Hose Chan &amp; got to see him alone. Guard that had prevented
                    it at 1st was removed from his job. So we sail on 17th &amp; all Embassies &amp;
                    Ministries go 1st women 2nd &amp; other men 3rd. That's a hot one if true &amp;
                    there will be plenty howling. However, I expect we'll get to go home 1st or 2nd.
                    News of the 17 however is great &amp; we celebrate till noon with all our crowd
                    &amp; the S.A.'s too.</p>
                <p>Walked in park after lunch &amp; threw pebbles at jelly fish [drawing of large
                    circle with four little circles inside which must be the jelly fish] which swim
                    transparent cup shape. Half doz. tanks rattled by &amp; crews came into park for
                    a breather. Kanehawa[?] M is anchored awaiting sailing of Br. next month.</p>
                <p>Last night I dreamed my honey had moved to Atlantic City to await my arrivalast

                <p>Guards warned us to keep close together as it is hard to protect us when
                    scattered about.</p>
                <p>Klinglebacker called at 6:45 to see us but was told we were at dinner - though we
                    weren't. So he had dinner &amp; came back &amp; was told we were still at dinner
                    so he went to see the internees at Bund Hotel &amp; came back &amp; had to wait
                    half an hour again to see us at 9:30. Said luggage instructions rec'd &amp;
                    things being loaded in Kobe by 11th &amp; we still sail the 17th. Doesn't know
                    about accommodations. Says about 110 will be going from Yoko. 30 at Bund, 15 at

                <p>Started playing ping pong on roof having brought balls &amp; net &amp; paddles
                    &amp; strung several old tables together into a makeshift.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>After lunch the chief of police of Kanagawa Prefect &amp; Sanitation[?] office
                    etc. called &amp; as we all refused to interpret they had one of the guards act.
                    The chief gives a pretty little speech about having no personal animosity even
                    if we are at war &amp; hopes we are all well &amp; asks if we have any wishes.
                    The cop interpreter said in translation “He say, if have opinion, say it” which
                    rather baffled those who didn't know J. so I interpolated saying he wants to
                    know if we have any requests to make. So we asked to walk from 4:30 pm to 5:30
                    instead of in heat of 2-4 &amp; that was O.K. asked about buying as Hotel shops
                    were being prevented from selling by police &amp; they said they were
                    considering taking us on shopping tour of Benten[?] dori[?] soon. They told
                    Mangled cats that he thinks more of his dogs than of his country &amp; he would
                    liked to have said that is because his country is safe &amp; his dogs aren't.
                    Salas wants stamps too but they said no stamps in Yoko &amp; Salas pointed out
                    that [?] had bought them but police interfered with bargaining.</p>
                <p>Miss Soares practiced piano from 3-4:30 &amp; then we all walked in park for an
                    hour.</p>
                <p>Same soup every meal: Ice cream nearly every meal.</p>
                <p>Klinehers called after dinner &amp; bought letters saying my radio was being
                    confiscated as I hadn't applied for permit &amp; I had him correct that as I had
                    applied in July '41 through Emb. but permit was never granted.</p>

                    had &amp; trouble in trying to get any silk things as the point system applie1
                    pt to 1 yd of silk piece goods for inst. &amp; no tickets anyway. But we all had

                    Dooman, the counselor, i.e., the second ranking officer, at Embassy Tokyo] is
                    responsible for it. Seems there are 240 1st places taken by embassy staffs, 96
                    2nd taken by women &amp; 560 3rd into which the rest of us go down in the hold.

                <p>Klinble Britches called in P.M. &amp; confirmed we are to sail the 17th. Didn't

                    missionaries in Sapporo who are in Jug &amp; that we won't let bank mgr. in NY
                    go unless these Am. go, so we wonder what will happen. I think we'll sail by the
                    21st but many are pessimistic.</p>
                <p>Interesting stories aboard from those who have rec'd all sorts of treatment” in
                    past 6 mo. The guys in jug have got it worst &amp; are pretty run down. Meyer of
                    St. Oil. [Clarence MeyeStandard Oil/Yokohama]. Dr. Myers [Dr. Harry Myers] old
                    missionary of Kobe looks like hell, J. Post[?] &amp; wife. Many others. Plenty
                    tales of woe. Meyer was in solitary &amp; is about � his former weight. Lived in
                    mortal terror &amp; is a wreck of former self.</p>
                <p>Embassy lads arr. during day &amp; I told them all what I thought of the
                    arrangement made. They say Dooman did it &amp; he got plenty cold shoulder from
                    us all. Bill Turner says the Dept. sent a “weasling[?] wire” which put it up to
                    them to give women &amp; children 2nd. Missionaries didn't expect it. Dooman
                    taking credit for it.</p>
                <p>Jane Slavens has plenty to say about the rest of the group of 60 which stopped at
                    the embassy. Plenty of fights &amp; Jane lays it on thick. Said the chain gang
                    of Grew, Dooman, Bohlen [Charles E. Bohlen, Tokyo second secretarlater
                    ambassador to Moscow], Steves, Boehringer [Carl H. Boehringer, Tokyo third
                    secretary], Johnston &amp; _____ played poker every da183 sessions from 3:36:30
                    &amp; stakes plenty high. Carl now down �4M. What foolishness.</p>
                <p>Had good talks with Sabe, Ural [Warner's wife's brother - U. Alexis Johnson, vice
                    consul Mukden, Manchuria], Emmons, Dick R. [Richardson], Rusty [?] &amp; found
                    much of interest.</p>

                <p>Blew off to Benny [?H. Merrell Benninghoff, Tokyo second secretary] &amp; he said
                    Blame Dooman. Chet Bohlen was also responsible I hear &amp; also hear they went
                    contrary to Dept. orders in putting us down in 3rd. It's lousy.</p>

                    stay with the Japanese when Ural and Krentz left] for so long &amp; no exercise

                <p>Talked with Makinson [George A. Makinson, Tokyo 1st secretary] about this African

                <p>Saw Dooman today &amp; squared away the African biz. He says the Dept. was

                <p>Says the Love biz is the last hitch to our sailing &amp; believes Love's senator

                    Hell.</p>
                <p>Told Dooman we'd had but one bath in week down in 3rd &amp; he considered it a
                    small matter that if we object too much they may confine us to 3rd
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>Got baths again this p.m. but no laundry yet.</p>

                    Southard is the one who is a bit off as Fornes &amp; others who came aboard
                    looked fairly normal.</p>
                <p>The reps checked lists &amp; rearranged cabins, etc.</p>
                <p>The main body of evacuees came out on a Kowloon ferry boasome 35 of thepacked in
                    like sardines.</p>
                <p>Baggaginc. no trunkwas sent over in barges.</p>
                <p>Met new roommate Bruins &amp; a very nice fellow too. Helped him with baggage
                    etc. &amp; showed him about the ship.</p>
                <p>New rules announced: -</p>
                <p>No baths, showers</p>
                <p>Wash room time cut in half for double the numbetypical J. figurin7-7:30 AM &amp;
                    5:30-6 PM.</p>
                <p>Meal hours rearranged &amp; 2 tables in all dining roommine now in 2nd at 7:30,
                    11:30 &amp; 6 &amp; 2nd tables 1 hr. later.</p>
                <p>Bob Ward came on &amp; I was certainly glad to see him. He is in fine shape &amp;
                    these tales of his being cracked are products of a distorted imagination.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>I see now why Southard said what he did for Bob was right &amp; Southard was
                    wronnamely Southard spoke to clubs etc. that there would absolutely be no war
                    &amp; Bob had been equally emphatic that there would be &amp; S. couldn't take
                    the let down. He has chivvied Bob all over hell in all sorts of things &amp; Bob
                    rebelled. But other listening agrees that Southard was the one who is off</p>
                <p>Hear that Fornes also couldn't take it.</p>
                <p>Bob went through some fighting &amp; shelling &amp; bombing &amp; even
                    volunteered but was rejected.</p>
                <p>The reaction of all the new comers was the same as ours in getting on the vessel.
                    They say “I just can't believe I'm here, I just can't believe it. It must be a
                    dream.” All have their fingers crossed.</p>
                <p>Bob studied Pittman &amp; Cantonese in internment &amp; they were all put in
                    school house next to Stanley Prison &amp; closely confined. Cliques formed &amp;
                    it was not at all pleasant. One fellow beaten for talking to outsiders. They had
                    no picnic but things weren't as bad as painted by Southard.</p>
                <p>Talked with Bob Coudray [Robert C. Coudray, vice consul, Hong Kong] about the
                    Seven Case etc. His Chinese boys family was killed &amp; he went through plenty
                    danger.</p>
                <p>Talked with Campbell of Treasury &amp; he very level-headed.</p>
                <p>Met Howard, Reed [Charles Reed, Saigon consul,, on detail in Hanoi] ___________
                    __________. [Left blank. Apparently meant to fill in names later.]</p>
                <p>The Chilean who teaches Spanish aboard gave a glowing[?] [glaring?] interview[?]
                    to press reps.</p>
                <p>J. Army lads wandering all over boat.</p>
                <p>Most of Hk bunch lost about all they had. Southard's house demolished almost
                    under him.</p>
                <p>Dooman up on deck today for 1st time.</p>
                <p>Tues. June 30</p>
                <p>End of fiscal yr. So what!</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Stayed up talking till beaut. full moon. Ship's lights dark till nearly 10 when
                    someone succeeded in getting the white crosses lit. The J. could just as soon
                    lose this ship it appears. Bastards.</p>
                <p>Up at 6:30 but water not on until 7:12. Damn. Couldn't shave &amp; neither could
                    most of the men. Many went unwashed. This is a slave ship, a pig ship, a cattle
                    boat, the way these J's are running it.</p>
                <p>Talked with a number of people aboard &amp; none had any too easy a time of it
                    wherever they were interned.</p>
                <p>Hk apparently fell through sheer paralysis. Very poor show put up by British.
                    Pop. of 1.7MM just before war fell to 500M at present &amp; things dead. Wealthy
                    Ch. went over lock stock &amp; barrel to the J.</p>
                <p>Chileans went ashore but were very restricted in shopping &amp; sightseeing
                    though they did get some liquor. Their reg. J. currency no good &amp; J. mil.
                    notes offered at 1 per $1.</p>
                <p>They had quite a job getting on the ship again in heavy seas.</p>
                <p>Sailed at 6 pm.</p>
                <p>Hotter than tofet all day.</p>
                <p>The electric white crosses at side &amp; back of ship not working so well. Rear
                    one out completely tonight &amp; one side one has many bulbs shot.</p>
                <p>The Conte Verde sailed from Sh. [Shanghai] with 638 inc. Lockhart [Frank P.
                    Lockhart, consul general, Shanghai] &amp; wife. Hear Sam, Steve etc. went to Sh.
                    &amp; certainly hope so. [Sam Sokobin, Kobe chief consul on his way back from
                    leave on Dec. 7. And probably Charles Stephen, Kobe vice consul, also on his way
                    back from leave.] We join the Verde at Singapore after we pick up Saigon people
                    &amp; the Verde will pick up Sing. people &amp; we go on together to L.M. J.
                    ships news bulletin says the Gripsholm will arr. L.M. July 15 but we can't make
                    it at this rate.</p>
                <p>So Portugal has declared it will be neutral. What is the dope back of that.</p>
                <p>The Germans are smashing into Egypt now. Damn but those Br. aren't holding. The
                    Russians are still a bright spot at Sebastopol &amp; elsewhere.</p>

                <p>Southard's press interview was godawfuslobbering with fear &amp; self
                    justification for his own false position. He will say it was distorted but those
                    who heard him talk with press say it was accurate &amp; terribly fawning.</p>
                <p>The Chileans didn't do so badly.</p>
                <p>Southard said the war would make J. &amp; U.S. even closer friends &amp; he hates
                    fighting them &amp; they are fine chaps &amp; then you ought to hear him in
                    private. Balls. He could have kept his mouth shut as did Grew.</p>
                <p>The deck chairs &amp; tables are all filled this eve. Boy this place is
                    crowded.</p>
                <p>Had a salt bath at Carrie's &amp; arr. with Hose Chihan to shave daily in his
                    cabin so I simply wash teeth, face &amp; hands from a bottle in AM.</p>
                <p>Ran through rainstorm all day.</p>
                <p>Wed. July 1</p>
                <p>A new fiscal yr.</p>
                <p>Gave table boy an advance payment of �1 each. Scottie, Roy, Arthur [Tower],
                    Burrell &amp; Emmons &amp; I eat together in 2nd now. The boy objected as he
                    says each should give �10 each. I told him that depended on his service &amp;
                    this was merely a down payment.</p>
                <p>4 ships passed us going north at noon. The leader with a faked mast to make it
                    look like a cruise.</p>
                <p>Studied &amp; sunned a bit.</p>
                <p>Heavy rains hit in late P.M. &amp; it got coolecleared up &amp; a beautiful
                    evening. Talked with Johnny &amp; Arthur Caro swapping stories of experiences.
                    C.A. had about 40 in it &amp; baths once a week. Studied J. &amp; Bolie[?] had
                    music classes. Food not too bad.</p>
                <p>Soares complained her dogs were hot out on back deck &amp; I said I'd exchange
                    accommodations with them.</p>
                <p>Moon came up fiery red at 11 P.M. J. time actually about 9 P.M. sun time.</p>

                <p>Could see what looked like smokestacks of factories of Saigon in distance but the
                    smokestacks kept shifting &amp; then we realized they were steamers winding
                    round the bends of river up ahead.</p>
                <p>Anchored &amp; small boats came alongside with bananas, pineapples, beer,

                <p>Chubb [Oliver E. Chubb, consul, Shanghai] from Saigon said he heard Kejei say
                    that the Germans had withdrawn their safe conduct guarantee from the Gripsholm
                    but that is still only a news story &amp; not to be credited too much.</p>

                <p>So Dooman is arranging cabins for the Gripsholm. Damn that!</p>
                <p>Wed. July 8 Flocks of 60 planes overhead in celebration of Gr. E. Asia day.</p>
                <p>Stayed inside most of the time with this sunburn. Read excerpts from Madame
                    Hanks[?] Ichiban's J. Lady[?] in America &amp; very well done. Del Re had an
                    introduction.</p>
                <p>Played bridge with Sabe, Tower &amp; Don Lorman[?] (Donald Duck) in aft for a
                    couple of hrs. &amp; lost 10 sen.</p>
                <p>Finally got laundry sent in at Hk.</p>
                <p>Water taken on till late P.M. &amp; then the water barge went back to the Conte
                    Verde.</p>
                <p>Storms off &amp; on all day &amp; hot most of time but cooled off in eve.</p>
                <p>Hear we sail at noon tomorrow &amp; get mail too &amp; time will probably change
                    to normal.</p>
                <p>Belot in eve with Burrell, Maple, Hamilton &amp; Mary Ogawa.</p>
                <p>Thurs. July 9</p>
                <p>Studied in a.m. on upper deck but smoke from launch kept driving people away.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>At noon as we finished lunch we sailed &amp; zigzagged through mine field
                    followed by the Conte Verde. We hear the trip to L.M. can be done in 10 days at
                    15 knots &amp; we should be able to do that OK.</p>
                <p>Also hear further water restrictions are to be imposed.</p>
                <p>Headed SE for Sunde Strait. Crossed the Equator at about 4-5 pm I should judge.
                    Hear we are to hit cool weather in a few days. It hasn't been too bad so far
                    when we stayed away from land.</p>
                <p>So the Germans are still advancing on Alexandria. Also some 20 ships sunk off N.
                    Norway say the Germanin Amer. convoy.</p>
                <p>Read a S?sho letter that Death Ray [is he referring to David Ray, Tokyo Embassy
                    language officer] had rec'd &amp; made out fairly well with it.</p>
                <p>And the big thing of the day was mail distributed about 2 p.m. I got several
                    letters from my honey but 2 were repeats. Anyway it was grand to read them again
                    even if they were last Sept. &amp; enclosed inc. letters even back to Feb. '41.
                    Also got letter from Dad about his trip up to Glacier Park &amp; Banff &amp;
                    Lake Louise. Liked his description of glacier color being beer bottle green.
                    Also his “moose up to his belly in a lake eating moose off the bottom.” They had
                    a grand trip. Ural enjoyed it too.</p>
                <p>Got papers &amp; some magazines &amp; that will keep us going a bit.</p>
                <p>Tonight we put the watches back an hr. sense for the 1st time, so we get up at a
                    fairly reasonable hour.</p>
                <p>Watched the stars with Johnny &amp; picked out S. cross &amp; north star &amp;
                    big dipper but aside from those we are hazy on our stars.</p>
                <p>Hear we all go back to the U.S. That's sense too.</p>
                <p>Also that Embassy lads are trying to sidestep Dooman's biz of 3rd class
                    assignments for us again on the Gripsholm. Hope they succeed. Lockhart will
                    object I'm sure.</p>

                <p>The Chileans say that Singapore is dead. It took them 8 hrs. to go &amp; 8 to
                    return so we're about 60 mi. away from Singapore. They slept 8 hrs. there &amp;
                    had only 4 for sightseeing &amp; buying. Were permitted to spend only 50 yen
                    apiece &amp; couldn't buy many things they wanted to get. Said the city is in
                    ruins &amp; the prisoners are being made to do coolie labor in restoration. Saw
                    Aussies with sun helmets &amp; shorts doing roadwork looking like they were half
                    starved. Said the J.'s barked at them (Chileans) like dogs in hastening them
                    along shopping etc. Also treated the Rajah like a nobody. Walked all over his
                    private rooms in palace without a by your leave.</p>
                <p>Fri. July 10</p>
                <p>Going very slowly but quite cool today.</p>
                <p>Crossed equator late yesterday. Some guy picked up the line so we wouldn't trip
                    on it.</p>
                <p>Read through the Supplemental C of L. instr. &amp; see that Rella &amp; the kids
                    get recompense from Mar 15, 1941May 10, '41 &amp; June 5my arrival in U.S. this
                    year at rate of $80 for her &amp; 20 for each child or $120 monthly which will
                    mean a nest egg of some $2000 when I get to N.Y. Also I'll be collecting about
                    $200 past [post?] allowance &amp; about $700 rent allowance so will have some
                    $3000 to fall back on.</p>
                <p>Beautiful sunrise &amp; sunset today. Johnny had never seen the like.</p>
                <p>T. had rows with waiter for insolence &amp; he complained through me to head
                    steward but we didn't get a new waiter. The waiter was insolent again at noon to
                    Burrell &amp; I told him we wanted service not words &amp; to shut up. He was
                    better the rest of the day.</p>
                <p>Went down to baggage room expecting to have to pay the racket of �1 per trunk
                    &amp; 50 sen per bag for my things but found that racket had been called
                    off.</p>
                <p>Mrs. Walker &amp; other missionaries are complaining about things on boat. Some
                    women don't like the 1st class accommodations as they feel other women have
                    better. They object to Mrs. Grew going to dining room in slacks. They consider
                    Dick Edwards not properly dressed when the fellow couldn't bring anything other
                    than he has on his back. They took names of 4th of July celebrants to complain
                    to State Dept. about song fesled by Clark. And for such as these we get shoved
                    into this 3rd class cattle pen.</p>
                <p>The missionaries are running the ship.</p>
                <p>Played bridge with Tower, Tex Weatherby [Meredith Weatherby, Vice Consul, Osaka]
                    &amp; Johnny &amp; lost to Johnny. But he owes me for previous.</p>

                <p>Just avoided a wreck by sharp turning.</p>
                <p>Sat. July 11</p>
                <p>Slept in upper last night changing with Bruins. The bunk is just wide enough for
                    me to lie squeezed in &amp; I hit head &amp; feet on end board. In turning the
                    pipes overhead are so low I hit shoulders &amp; elbows. Damn! Have to slide into
                    the cave one way &amp; it certainly is a trap.</p>
                <p>Passed masts of small steamer wreck this A.M. It was on bottom apparently as
                    masts just above surface close together.</p>
                <p>This area has been well fought over.</p>
                <p>Passing through the Sunde Straits this A.M. Very close to shores &amp; hear this

                    per day. On getting through the straits late this P.M. we turned SW nearly West
                    &amp; stepped out a bit. A fine day. Warm but cooler as we got further along.
                    Began rolling.</p>
                <p>Did some washing &amp; the laundry is taking no more.</p>
                <p>Sun. July 12</p>
                <p>Just midway between my honey's birthday date of Jan. 12. How I wish she &amp; the
                    children were with me.</p>
                <p>Church services this A.M. &amp; Catholic first, then Protestant with a young
                    preacher from Stanley Prison Hk. on the pulpit saying we must have faith that
                    truth &amp; justice will finally prevail.</p>
                <p>Notices appeared today that deck chairs are not to be put on the forward deck as
                    it disturbs the navigators. Temperamental slide rulers.</p>
                <p>Hard to find a place to work these days as they are only a few writing desks, but
                    I keep at the Kanji &amp; sosho &amp; do the ship's paper dailit is gy?sho.</p>
                <p>Johnny &amp; I agreed that we should start wheels moving on this rumored biz of
                    preparing assignments for the Gripsholm: I have asked Bob to see Peck[?] &amp; I
                    told Johnny I'd see if Bruins could work on Southard.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I talked with Bruins &amp; gave him the background &amp; said we didn't want to
                    get done in the eye by Dooman again. He agreed &amp; said Southard hates
                    Doomacalls him an [?] ragpicker &amp; “not even a white man” which means plenty
                    in Ky. Bruins also pumped Charlie &amp; found that the Embassy felt that the
                    Dept. had let it down on this 3rd class biz &amp; Dooman had arbitrarily put
                    anyone in 3rd.</p>
                <p>This eve Bruins said he'd put the bug in Southard's ear &amp; the reaction was as
                    expected. Said Southard had him go to Dooman &amp; tell him that Southard was
                    extremely dissatisfied with arrangements &amp; many others are too though they
                    aren't adding to difficulties by complaining. Asked Dooman how we were assigned
                    as we were &amp; Dooman said that assignments had been made after consultation
                    with the Dept. but that the Dept. had been ambiguous. Asked how come all the
                    girl clerks come in 1st &amp; Dooman bridled &amp; asked if Southard would
                    preceed women into the lifeboats. Bruins said the ship is safer - those crossing
                    &amp; 2nd st &amp; besides many women are in 3rd.</p>
                <p>Asked if all on C Verde are 1st &amp; said Dooman said he didn't know. Bruins
                    said if they are &amp; it is nec. to send officers to 3rd on Gripsholm then
                    those fellows might well take a turn.</p>
                <p>Asked if lists are being prepared for assignments on Gripsholm &amp; was told no
                    that a consolidated passenger list is being prepared as none exists.</p>
                <p>Other points covered like putting discredited red cross rep from Hk. in 1st when
                    he was deported by J. Also case of Italian nat'l of Turkish race in 1st when she
                    might not to be on ship. About 12 or so from Hk shouldn't have been put aboard
                    but J. just did so anyway.</p>

                <p>Wave dashed over us in nighcaught in mid-scoop. Many cabins on this D deck

                <p>Jim, Charles &amp; I had cocktails last evening which Jim made.</p>
                <p>Calmed down considerably during the day &amp; quite sunny &amp; nice. But could
                    not open portholes as the occasional wave dashes up.</p>
                <p>Hear we get there Tues. eve. the 21st. Hope so.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>Had long talk with Bob about Al Rowe [Alvin Rowe, Shanghai vice consul] &amp;
                    Foochow &amp; other subjects. Listened to Tommy Thomassen's music on back deck
                    for a while. Am reading the news bulletins daily to an ever increasing
                    clientele.</p>
                <p>Sat. July 18</p>
                <p>Quite calm this morning. A fine day &amp; we speed along in high.</p>
                <p>Finished Grandma Called It Carnal. Story of youth of girl brought up by her
                    grandma in Conn. Old lady pretty straight laced &amp; a barren existence was led
                    as usual.</p>
                <p>Cocktails with Scotty, Roy, &amp; Tower in Hose Chihan's room. Wash bowl broken
                    by a Braziliaa major tragedy as I wash &amp; shave there.</p>
                <p>Meals pretty horrible.</p>
                <p>Bridge with Pawley, Bruins &amp; Stuart &amp; lost �4.</p>
                <p>Jim Espy held 4 aces at poker over Grew's 4 queens &amp; won �800.</p>
                <p>Sun. July 19</p>
                <p>Porthole partly opened last night.</p>
                <p>Church this A.M. after having finished writing up the 3000 characters. Some
                    typical fire eating preacher who kept repeating God is [?] so your sins will
                    find you out, but God will forgive true repenters. Boring biz.</p>
                <p>Bob Ward had cocktail party that lasted to 2 A.M. Scottie gave a speech in
                    denunciation of the circular by Kelk[?] asking for contributions of �100-120
                    from 1st, �80-100 from 2nd &amp; 50-70 from 3rd class passengers. He thanked
                    those three who had given 50 sen each &amp; those 2 other promises of �1 apiece
                    etc.</p>
                <p>Bob out to do big things in this life. Figures he has it pretty well sized up.
                    Hope it doesn't throw him.</p>
                <p>Benny [Benninghoff?] worried that people think he is pro Japanese &amp; that it
                    will be held against him in the States.</p>
                <p>Sighted whales.</p>
                <p>Mon. July 20</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>Spent most of day recovering from last night.</p>
                <p>We're notified that remaining yen will be receipted for &amp; will be reimbursed
                    at the Dept. at �3.33 1/3 to $1. What a rate! &amp; what a windfall for those
                    with Yen. I have but �80 left. That renders those pearls expensive. Brazil etc.
                    not in on this arrangement.</p>
                <p>Tues. July 21</p>
                <p>Hear we get in L.M. at 8 pm tomorrow &amp; stay on boat till Thurs at 1 pm &amp;
                    exchanged Friday the 24th.</p>
                <p>Quite cool &amp; began rocking again.</p>
                <p>Canned goods party in eve &amp; made coffee too.</p>
                <p>Got missing char [characters] written on ship &amp; wrote those up too. So all
                    done with those in Kihon Kanji now. Now to know them.</p>
                <p>Translating news bulletins daily for Makinson.</p>
                <p>Sighted a destroyer off north.</p>
                <p>Wed. July 22</p>
                <p>Land visible when we got up at 7 &amp; slowing down alongside abut 10 AM.</p>
                <p>Figure we're too far along now to do any turning back.</p>
                <p>Took on pilot. He was rowed him out from pilot ship anchored off mouth of
                    bay.</p>
                <p>Large ship behind Conte Verde rumored to be the Gripsholm but I figure that has
                    docked.</p>
                <p>Could see Polava[?] Hotel standing out on shore as we steamed into fine harbor.
                    Numerous freighters &amp; oil tankers anchored there &amp; first one we came to
                    was an American Tanker which gave us plenty toots &amp; cheers as we passed.
                    Caused lumps in the throats &amp; we cheered plenty too. Great thrill. Saw
                    Gripsholm anchored or rather tied up at dock with DIPLOMAT GRIPSHOLM SVIERIGE in
                    black on the white side &amp; blue &amp; yellow stripes up &amp; down fore &amp;
                    aft &amp; yellow &amp; white crosses too. [Following 2 sentences inserted later]
                    Winan[?] remarked look how the Gripsholm is scarred. Something terrible has
                    happened. That ship looks good to us. J. birds cheer as we pass but we are
                    silent.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Rumors that we don't get ashore blasted by report that J's arrived several days
                    ago &amp; have been ashore freely.</p>
                <p>Am. Consul Preston [Austin R. Preston, consul at Lorenzo Marques] &amp; helpers
                    came on Asama with mail &amp; plenty from my honey. Boy was it great to hear
                    from her again &amp; to know that she &amp; the kids are still bearing up OK
                    though they do miss me like I miss them.</p>
                <p>She &amp; Aunt Bessie [Warner's aunt, who he lived with most of the time from age
                    11 on] sent lots of clippings &amp; I put them on a table in main lounge so all
                    could read &amp; they were greatly enjoyed as we got no papers or magazines in
                    this delivery. So Doolittle did bomb Japan in April &amp; Quezon is still alive
                    &amp; in Wash. And we are very realistic about reporting on the war. Nothing
                    about 1 American being a match for 10 Germans or Japanese but real down to the
                    earth recognition that things weren't too good &amp; we must get in there
                    pitching. We have reverseprints them. No hysteria &amp; blarney. Great
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>Hear that some can get to stay ashore in hotels if they wish &amp; Preston has
                    engaged rooms but it is expensive &amp; will be at our own expense as
                    accommodations are provided on the ships.</p>
                <p>I decide against going as do most of others as we hear we can't go ashore today
                    anyway though the Verde people got off their boat at noon &amp; many came to
                    visit us. Saw Mrs. Lockhart, Ed Stanton [Edwin Stanton, Shanghai consul], Bob
                    McCann &amp; others &amp; find that they had a fine time on Verdgood cabins
                    &amp; no crowding &amp; all according to rank. Had fair food &amp; good
                    orchestra &amp; up to Singapore had Swimming pool but that closed by Asama
                    captaia bastard on wheels. They consider our arrangement a dumb political trick
                    on part of Doomaas it waa real injustice.</p>
                <p>Transfer lists inc. 28 officers &amp; 20 clerks with mostly single men though
                    several married men asked for transfers &amp; apparently don't care about seeing
                    their wives. Roy [Roy Melbourne] to Istanbul.</p>
                <p>Some promotions with Chas. Cooper, Jim Espy, Fornes included.</p>
                <p>Roy shouldn't have been inc. but he is to go to Istanbul. He would be much more
                    valuable in U.S. on shipping as he has specialized in that for 1 � yrs. So he
                    wrote dispatch to go to Wash. to see if he can't be got back. I'll see
                    Langsted[?] on his behalf. Also taking pearls to his folks. The Canadian[?]
                    girlfriend has let him down. Not even a line. Tough going.</p>
                <p>Thurs. July 23</p>
                <p>Notice says our exchange is to begin at 9 AM &amp; up early in cold but with
                    usual J. touch in details the water is late &amp; scarce.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>Tipped room steward �10 each in addition to the �2-3 per week we'd given him all
                    along. Scottie &amp; Tower didn't tip table steward but the rest of us did a
                    very little however as he was pretty surly.</p>
                <p>Slip says we can take but 2 pc. baggage each into Grips cabin, but that's pretty
                    late dope as I've packed 4 for the cabin. So I carry 2 &amp; briefcase. Queue
                    forms to get off boat &amp; we get slips for receipt for passports taken up the
                    previous day. The Verde is on other side of Grips &amp; we &amp; J. all change
                    at once in well defined lines &amp; only 1 line used off Asama though others
                    could go off many gangplanks. Take our things to Grips &amp; find all in
                    confusion &amp; not possible to go to cabins before night as cleaning must be
                    done so Johnny &amp; I go up street thinking we may be thrown back at the
                    customs entrance but got through OK. Meet up with Scottie &amp; Burrell &amp;
                    stop in a grocery store to ask way to bank &amp; he offers to exchange $1 for 20
                    Escudos so we take it up though we learned we could have got 24 to 1 at the
                    boat. But we'd have had to wait in line &amp; needed cash for telegrams.</p>
                <p>To tel. office &amp; sent wire to Rella: - 622 Oak, Laguna Beach, Calif.
                    Appreciated letters. Plans unknown but if leave granted would come Cal.
                    otherwise see you New York feeling Fine. Love.</p>
                <p>Felt great to be free &amp; no one trailing us or overhearing our talk. Got paper
                    &amp; it's very pro axis &amp; Egyptian biz going OK but Russians in bad way.
                    Write up on our arrival says we'd been told not to talk as we haprobably caused
                    by Southard biz in Hk. somewhat. But we might harm those left in Japan.</p>
                <p>Window shopped &amp; then went to a modernistic bldg for sandwiches &amp; beer.
                    Great big thick meat &amp; cheese sandwiches surely tasted good. Decided not to
                    return to ship for lunch but later heard it was a humdinger Smorgasborg. Sorry
                    we missed it.</p>
                <p>Decided to call at Br. Cons. to wire messages to Mrs. Mac Dermott, Mrs. Alex
                    Taylor &amp; Mrs. Roy Pearson c/o Bank of New South Wales, Sydney that their
                    husbands are well &amp; will be coming end of August. Consulate closed till 2:30
                    then open only for 1 hr. so we walked out to Polava Hotel &amp; bacan hr. each
                    way. Town very neat &amp; modern &amp; air &amp; climate like Calif. at its
                    best. Taxis rushing about. New bldgs &amp; much new bldg. going on. Mainly
                    whites on streets though many Negroes. Good parks.</p>
                <p>Back to ship by evening after stopping for beer en route with Scottie, Fred
                    Munson[?], etc. Still no cabins &amp; line forming to get arrangements. Bunch of
                    us went to eat at 7:30. 2 sittings of 6 PM &amp; 7:30 &amp; can eat anywhere
                    now.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Visited with many friends on deck. Dawson [Owen L. Dawson, Shanghai consul and
                    agricultural attach�] missing &amp; they think he may have got to U.S. via Java.
                    Sam, Steve, &amp; others left behind at last minute. Damn tough luck. Only
                    civilians from China and those who were in prison. Paul &amp; Minnie Plath
                    aboard. Alice Driper[?] thin as hell &amp; had bad experience. Hazel Katz on
                    too. Bill Yuni [William Yuni, Tientsin vice consul], &amp; Beppo [Beppo R.
                    Johansen, 3rd secretary at Embassy Peiping] &amp; Ludden [Raymond Ludden, Canton
                    vice consul] &amp; Fred Munson[?] &amp; Butrick [Richard P. Butrick, counselor
                    at Embassy Peiping and thus its ranking officer since the ambassador was
                    stationed at Chungking] &amp; Berger [David Berger, Shanghai consul] &amp;
                    Horace Smith [Shanghai consul] &amp; Hinckey [?Frederick Hinke, Shanghai consul]
                    &amp; the Caldwells [John Caldwell, Tientsin consul general] &amp; Bob McCann
                    &amp; Spielman.</p>
                <p>Finally decided to see if something couldn't be done about the long line waiting
                    for room assignments - 1 line. Dooman was apathetic &amp; said he was taking
                    women with small children out of line. Muir the State Dept. rep sent out on ship
                    said he couldn't do a thing but turned Bob Ward &amp; me over to Am. Export
                    lines man Mac who went into a long song &amp; dance about Lisbon, the
                    Drottningholm, 150 J. 5th columnists in Penn. &amp; all over the lot &amp; we
                    tried to pin him down to say that assignments hadn't yet been made &amp; he
                    reluctantly admitted it. He &amp; others in state of confusion. We asked to
                    split up lists &amp; give officers each a batch to do but that couldn't be as
                    the State Dept. list, the Asama list &amp; Verde list had to be compared [?] the
                    agent 1 by 1 and it took several minutes for each case. God what a system. We
                    asked him to have people go to any cabin for the night but that wouldn't do
                    &amp; we saw there was no way out of confusion at this late hour so gave up.</p>
                <p>Charlie Cooper got me my cabin no. 165 on B deck at 11:30 PM &amp; I turned in.
                    My cabin mates consul Brookhart of Shanghai [Charles E. “Ned” Brookhart,
                    Shanghai consul] &amp; [? ?] came in at 1:30 &amp; said many were still
                    waiting.</p>
                <p>Fri July 24</p>
                <p>Located baggage &amp; helped Roy &amp; Tower find theirs in warehouses. See some
                    of my cases are broken open. Must get rope &amp; tie up replacing rice straw
                    rope in N.Y.</p>
                <p>Johnny, Tower &amp; I go to Museum in P.M. well arranged &amp; excellently
                    mounted exhibits of African animals, birds, snakes, fishes, insects, stones,
                    native mfgrs &amp; military trophies. Also odd monstrosities of 3 legged &amp; 5
                    legged calves. Embryos of hippo &amp; elephants, etc. Saw the tsetse fly which
                    is like a housefly on a binge. Effects of elephantiasis. Native work inc. silver
                    filigree, ebony &amp; ivory articles &amp; grass weaving.</p>
                <p>On to Polava for some Madeira &amp; walked back to ship via beach road &amp; a
                    fox terrier, Sanbeze[?] adopted us to the customs entrance.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>Saw “Babes on Broadway” with Mickey Rooney &amp;____________ [Judy Garland]. OK.
                    Reviews of “Blood &amp; Sand” which my honey &amp; I saw in Hollywood a year
                    ago. Poignant memories.</p>
                <p>Sat. July 25</p>
                <p>More transfers inc. Bruce Rogers &amp; he not so happy about that. Fred Mann
                    [Frederick Mann, Kobe vice consul] finally arranged his marriage held at 4 pm at
                    Polava. He must become Catholic etc. the usual biz. Wonder how that quick match
                    will work.</p>
                <p>All transferees to Johannesberg to await orders.</p>
                <p>C. J. Eskeline, manager of Standard Oil, Tientsin, assigned as new cabin mate.
                    Dix Edwards [Jay Dixon Edwards, Harbin Manchuria vice consul] has wild tale of
                    being shifted down to 600's. Room arrangements not even yet completed. However
                    further inquiries reveal we are not to go below so that is something.</p>
                <p>Went on the Hippo trip with 12 others inc. Dave Lamm [Dave Lamm, vice consul
                    Tokyo] Tower, Burrell, Maple, Slavens &amp; wife, Beppo, etc. Go by train some
                    30 km. up along coast. Pretty country but flat here &amp; poorly cultivated.
                    Negro huts &amp; kids dancing in home arenthey've got rhythm. Had lunch at Vila
                    Luisa &amp; then took motor boat out the Incomati river for 15 min. &amp; saw 2
                    hippos puffing, blinking &amp; wiggling ears as they came to surface after dive
                    of from 5 sec. to 1 min.</p>
                <p>Back to Vila Luisa &amp; no train for 2 � hrs. so Tower, Burrell (bug man) &amp;
                    Lamm (bird man) &amp; I struck out main road &amp; then off side paths to Negro
                    huts &amp; settlements to see life a bit off the beaten track. Burrell &amp;
                    Lamm were in their elements finding new things &amp; Tower &amp; I tried new
                    fruits &amp; investigated the people's houses etc. Thin, round, windowless huts
                    are made of reed lashed together with grass roofs. Cooking done out of doors
                    &amp; a maize is pounded in a mountain to make a corn pone which they eat. Also
                    eat fruits &amp; hot spicey things like peppers.</p>
                <p>Saw cock fighting arena. Clothes are wrap around cloths &amp; batik like
                    designs.</p>
                <p>Back to train by 7 PM &amp; all tickets had cost E. 60 ($2.50).</p>
                <p>Window shopping with Beppo in eve &amp; found where to get silver, ebony, ivory
                    etc. Beppo says the China officers were all on their toes &amp; felt things were
                    about to break but Tokyo Embassy (Dooman) poopoohed all advice. We beefed plenty
                    over incompetence at top.</p>

                    it went off like clockwork.</p>
                <p>I made one suggestion which speeded things up so that people didn't have to wait
                    in line at all &amp; kept all officers busy by distributing work. Few people
                    objected to paying the $525 or rather signing promissory note for it. But we
                    didn't weed out the foreigners who should not be aboard.</p>
                <p>Table arrangements made with Butrick, Bruins, Frazee[?] &amp; Reed in 1st class

                    Cabins still being shifted. The South Americans are most difficult in this biz
                    &amp; insist on the best or they will leave, etc.</p>
                <p>Shopped for wingot 15 liters (3 jugs) for Es. 180 ($7.50) &amp; will decant &amp;

                <p>Tried to get air passage dope without success.</p>

                <p>Also a letter from Rella very welcome with dope on expenses. It is certainly
                    costing plenty to live in the U.S. She knows about the allowance biz for her
                    &amp; kids &amp; is spending on that basis too so guess we'll be broke as usual
                    but money is of no use trying to keep these days. She had expected us to be
                    exchanged soon when she wrote thein Feb. &amp; other letters are so expecting me
                    to get there quick that I decided to wire &amp; get plane reservations from Rio
                    or Trinidad if possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>Wired: Sec. State Washington if practicable have wife reserve me airplane passage
                    Rio or Trinidad to Glendale Warner. Asked Roy to take message ashore when he
                    goes. Found Schafer[?] Pan Am man from Hk. &amp; he gave me dope re fares etc.
                    Said Rio to Glendale via B.A. is $525. Via TrinidaMiami is $425 &amp; from
                    Trinidad via Panama &amp; Latin American Capitals is $230. So I hope I can get
                    something. We get 25% off &amp; also it will not be much more if from Trinidad
                    then it would be by going to N.Y. &amp; then across.</p>
                <p>As I can do nothing about reservations or even know if Dept. would approvfrom
                    this end I decided to let the Dept. tell Rella to go ahead or not as they decide
                    &amp; she can then get me what is open.</p>
                <p>On returning to cabin at midnight I found a slip from tel. office saying my
                    message of July 23 must have my full name on it. Telephoned but couldn't get it
                    straight so caught Roy before he left to straighten it out. Helped him out with
                    baggage &amp; saw him off at 1 pm &amp; had him take a revised message to Rella
                    if the 23rd hadn't gone normally: - “Appreciated letters Plans unknown but may
                    fly from Rio or Trinidad to Glendale otherwise see you New York Feeling fine

                    room stewards paying half at Rio, but Bruins &amp; Butrick think that too high
                    for the service we geguess they are righAs 2 waiters take care of 23 people each
                    at 2 sittings &amp; if each rec'd $20 each that would be $460 each for table
                    stewards which is pretty high. About $12 is better.</p>

                    &amp; invitations from Mrs. Caffrey [Jefferson Caffrey was US ambassador to Rio

                    and Warner's sister-in-law].</p>
                <p>Saw Johnny next at Caffreys cocktails at 6:30 &amp; he hadn't been able to get
                    the dope on phoning so we tried at the party but all said it was difficult these

                <p>Decided to try at Urca that eve.</p>
                <p>Went to Childs from Caffreys. Saw Cabot Coville [2nd secretary at Embassy Lima],

                    with John &amp; there is a pitiful lack of men with knowledge of J. in U.S. Says
                    Dept. wants more men down in S.A. &amp; some of us might be sent down. In

                <p>Childs live in swank Ibira at Copacabana grand new section on the beach. They get

                <p>Went to consulate &amp; waited all morning for call for my honey &amp; the

                    sent a telegram instead. (Milreis 160 or $8) &amp; M. 33 for canceling tel.
                    call. Damn it all. I did so want to hear her sweet voice. I could love the

                <p>Missed lunch but got back to ship to find it goes at 4 pm now. Johnny missed
                    lunch too so I opened a few remaining cans of thingbeans, brown bread, sardines

                <p>Prescott Childs busmainly on money exchange. They are taking up $ fast as

                    lines wait for places. But Rio does look civilized &amp; is a great town.
                    Climate perhaps not so good but not so bad either.</p>
                <p>Wed. Aug 12</p>
                <p>35 yrs. old today &amp; lolled about sunning &amp; reading &amp; trying to get
                    rid of this bad cold before I get back to my honey. Reviewed mentally where I'd
                    been during all the 35 birthdays &amp; found my heart beating fast over
                    recollections of August 1936 with my honey in Karizawa. Find my love for her has
                    grown steadily and can only thank God that I've been favored with such a wife,
                    sweetheart and lover in one, and that we have been blessed with a small pair of
                    kids. Makes things worthwhile in this turmoil of a world of ours. Something
                    worth fighting for to help make peace and order out of this war and
                    confusion.</p>
                <p>Several ringers[?] got on the boat at Rio inc. Bert Watts &amp; Dusenbury
                    [Colonel Ralph W. Dusenbury, military attache at Embassy Madrid] who used to be
                    in Tokyo as language students. Also several missed the boat completely inc. a
                    couple of bar stewards, 8 Swedish seamen, the Venezualan minister &amp; wife
                    &amp; perhaps others. Lifeboats are lowered over sides ready for action &amp; we
                    hear the J. birds carried the lifebelts all the time bet. N.Y. &amp; Rio. So
                    we'll be glad to see this last leg finished without mishap. I would have
                    preferred to fly from Rio as I have a feeling we may be in for trouble, but that
                    can't be helped now. Sorry I couldn't get through to my honey but priorities
                    must have done us in the eye.</p>
                <p>Anyway in wire I said: - “Thirty days leave. If preferable remain there reserving
                    airplane or train tickets allowing one day New York Love.” Had to put her full
                    name and more at end of message &amp; make all into 25 words so several extra
                    words were cut out. Anyway she can decide what is best to do.</p>
                <p>Thurs. Aug 13</p>
                <p>Lolled about &amp; read &amp; sunned most of the day. Washed out some shirts as
                    the ships laundry is too slow. Saw “Corsican Brothers” with Doug Fairbankvery
                    good rendition.</p>

                <p>Good weather &amp; smooth sailing. Hope we make N.Y. by 23rd as I can then
                    certainly get to Glendale by the 29th even if by train. Really beginning to
                    think of meeting my honey now. What a long wait for the both of us. Pray God
                    that this long a separation may never happen again. It will be more then either
                    of us can stand. It is not alone hard on us both but on the children tosuch an
                    abnormal life without a father. I had too much of it myself.</p>
                <p>Drum gave me a Brazilian doll for his goddaughteBetty. She will be pleased in
                    time.</p>

                <p>Have been thinking about all the J.'s interned in U.S. &amp; believe there must
                    be many who are loyal to U.S. &amp; wonder if they can't be determined &amp;
                    released &amp; put to work for us. Would have to work out a set of questions the
                    answers to which would give clue to loyalty. Could perhaps get ideas from the
                    “temperament” tests used by Lockheed. Might be worth putting up to the Dept. to
                    see what could be done. I could then work on the West Coast &amp; have the
                    family with me &amp; aid the war effort.</p>
                <p>Got acct. letters written also re disallowance of $59 for shipping effects from
                    Kobe to S.F. on J. steamer last year. Shipped July 16 before dept. authorization
                    of July 23 but understood it was for fiscal yr. &amp; also no Am. shipping so
                    had to send by a J. boat. But of course I could have sent to Shanghai to get Am.

                <p>At 5 pm we sighted a craft on the horizon that looked like a sub. Turned away
                    from it to watch &amp; then headed for it. Through glasses it looked like a
                    tanker that had been torpedoed &amp; was still afloat &amp; looked like many men
                    were standing up along its deck. Passed some wooden wreckagships rib sticking
                    out of water. Came to the main thing &amp; took a turn around it at close
                    quarters. It was wooden &amp; charred &amp; numerous derricks &amp; steel
                    reinforcement rods sticking up. A kerosene fire was burning on one sidsmelled
                    the smoke &amp; flames would pop up. But no life. It was fast growing darafter 6
                    &amp; like a bad dream trying to make out what it was. Some thought it was part
                    of a freighter or oil tanker. But the wood ? And small cranes &amp; dock like
                    appearance. I think it may have been a Nazi sub floating dock &amp; machine shop
                    &amp; refueling repair base. The oil still in tanks under water may have kept it
                    afloat. Probably shelled &amp; wrecked days ago.</p>

                    transportation &amp; the damage will be greater than any gain in J. morale.</p>
                <p>Catching up on reading of Lifes &amp; surprised to find the lack of a conception
                    that we are at war or the will to buckle down.</p>
                <p>Drinks with Tower, Scottie, Hawthorne &amp; Bob Ward &amp; Johnnie.</p>
                <p>Rained off &amp; one during day as we passed through the Sargasso Sea.</p>
                <p>Thurs. Aug 20</p>
                <p>Showers off &amp; on all day. Looks like we get there the 25th, no more, no less.
                    Wonder if my honey will meet me. Damn, how I long to see her! to hold her once
                    more and become one again.</p>
                <p>Dining room plenty hot now as impossible to open starboard portholes without
                    water splashing in. So most of us eat without coats.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Introduced Bob to Remer &amp; he gave him dope. Bob would like to go back to
                    Chungking &amp; may be able to do so. This is the big opportunity for which he
                    has prepared for 14 yrs. &amp; he wants to be in midst of it. I too want to do
                    all I can but feel I can work[?] best in U.S. on J. things &amp; have Rella
                    &amp; the kids with me. Any further separation would be just too much. We took
                    each other for better or worse and it's not part of life for the family to be
                    separated. But just a few days more now, and then!!!</p>
                <p>Bob &amp; I talked about the make up of the world. He feels the whole biz is an
                    experiment which may be repeated elsewhere &amp; may be done in other forms at
                    other times, i.e. that the human being part of it is just one type of what we
                    call life &amp; we're pretty damn puny &amp; a period will come to it all in
                    time. We are now between ice ages &amp; the world may have existed in diff.
                    forms bet. other ice ages. That is shown by fossil development &amp; findings
                    anyway but apparently man in his present form &amp; number didn't exist here
                    before that we have found. The whole cycle may take millions of years to work
                    out before the sun bursts or cools &amp; we become a moon as far as life goes.
                    When I think that we are but one world in our galaxy &amp; there are millions of
                    galaxies it is simply astounding.</p>
                <p>But anyway this is the world we know &amp; the life we know &amp; we have to play
                    the game according to rules or lack of them &amp; the now &amp; the present are
                    the biggest factors in running our lives.</p>
                <p>It is all absorbingly interesting and there is no reason for a person to rejoin
                    the elements sooner than the natural process contemplates so living to the full
                    is the thing to do.</p>
                <p>For me living to the full means having my wife and children with me and having
                    congenial work.</p>
                <p>Fri. Aug 21</p>
                <p>To bed early last evening for not much of any reason but to think about my honey
                    &amp; the kids.</p>
                <p>Sunned &amp; read &amp; attended Dartmouth group meeting in p.m.</p>
                <p>Heard of FOR (Fellowship of Reconciliation) meeting to be held in A.M. They are
                    for letting the J.'s have all they want &amp; throwing ourselves on their
                    “mercy.” God, what fools!</p>
                <p>Had good talks with Dusenbury, Remer &amp; Moore.</p>
                <p>Sat. Aug 22</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>FOR meeting held on main deck with 4 men &amp; 12 women attending. Young Galt led
                    the meeting &amp; explained tenets. His wife &amp; the Walsers there but I
                    didn't recognize others. They prayed, read Bible excerpts, toasted Flanders
                    Fields. Wished a just peace, couldn't say much about not being able to do
                    anything now we are at war. Pretty innocuous.</p>
                <p>Saw “Charley's Aunt” with Jack Bennexcellent, though Chas. Ruggles was better in
                    previous show I think.</p>
                <p>Conte Verde talent put on good amateur performance. Must have Rella get Jack
                    &amp; Jill as a novelty numbedone as the Eng, Ital, Ger., Fr. &amp; Am. would
                    sing it.</p>
                <p>Tony Freeman good on the slide trombone.</p>
                <p>Bruins got us Great Western white wine (N.Y. state wine) for dinner. Rather like
                    perfume.</p>
                <p>Arguing we must strike the octopus at its heaJapabomb industries &amp;
                    transportation.</p>
                <p>Office work ended today.</p>
                <p>Sunday Aug 23</p>
                <p>And this is the week in which my honey &amp; I celebrate! What a lovely thought,
                    that we will be reunited again.</p>
                <p>Read &amp; sunned.</p>
                <p>Tried to give the war savings bond biz a punch in the arm but Walt Frazee isn't
                    much help on it. Dick Butrick feels he chose a committee wrongly in getting
                    older men with big names when he should have got young men with plenty drive.
                    Dick said he has always had one thing he strove to dnever make the same mistake
                    twice &amp; always profit by mistakes.</p>
                <p>Mon. Aug 24</p>
                <p>Turned in all old magazines for those coming on next boat to read.</p>
                <p>Rained off &amp; one. Smelled N.Y.</p>
                <p>Everyone had temperature taken.</p>
                <p>Packed for the getaway. May travel west with Tony Freeman. John Bruins also
                    going, but later.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>Dick Butrick said he was sorry I wasn't in the China Service &amp; he'd make me
                    an honorary member. I thanked him and said I almost did, but Billy (Bally[?])
                    switched me to Japan &amp; I figured we needed men to help lick these people,
                    but had plenty to hold the China front.</p>
                <p>It hardly seems possible I'll be with my honey before long.</p>
                <p>Tues. Aug 25</p>
                <p>Up at 3:45 AM to see the lights in N.Y. Harbor in distance. Pretty cold.</p>
                <p>In quarantine at 6 and we all had to be on deck though no exam.</p>
                <p>Swarms of F.B.I., Army, Navy , &amp; Immigration officials came aboard shortly
                    after we docked in Jersey City at 9 AM.</p>
                <p>Letter from my honey tells of plane reservations for L.A. Good going.</p>
                <p>Max Hamilton, Geo. Atcheson [George Atcheson, Jr.] &amp; Ringwalt [Arthur R.
                    Ringwalt] aboard. Met Erhardt [John Erhardt], Chief of Personnel &amp; he
                    thought that as a J. language man I'd be going to S.A. Erhardt is a big, gruff,
                    open-hearted fellow &amp; very likeable. I said Nerts to S.A. I want to do
                    something usefuto contribute to the war effort.</p>
                <p>Thorough passenger examinations &amp; questioned by F.B.I. Army &amp; Navy &amp;
                    told not to reveal military secrets or mention about bombing of Japan as it
                    might create demand for more of that. PP taken up but I got a receipt to
                    use.</p>
                <p>About 1st off boat &amp; got baggage out &amp; got very good customs man. Money
                    examined by F.B.I. &amp; questioned as to where I got it. Customs very helpful
                    &amp; checked all through quickly.</p>
                <p>Met by about 50 reporters at gate. Asked all sorts of questions about Japan &amp;
                    took plenty pictures inc. newsreel. Main point I made was that the J. are
                    concentrating on all out war to take our scalps &amp; they are a united nation
                    behind their military leaders. They have to be. Asked if I'd been treated
                    brutally &amp; I said no but know of some officers who had been mainly outside
                    of J. proper as in Hk. Asked about raid &amp; said I couldn't talk about mil.
                    matters. Asked if treatment worse after raid &amp; said it had stiffened for a
                    time. Asked if reporters know of more than one raid &amp; they didn't though I
                    said the J. had expected more.</p>
                <p>Taxi to Knickerbocker Hotel from Jersey City. Cal [Warner's mother] &amp; Kay
                    [Kay Kiefer, family friend] not there but I went on to Joan's [Warner's sister]
                    &amp; arr. just as Cal &amp; Kay did. Joan looking grand &amp; certainly has a
                    precocious child 8 months old [Bernadette Yvonne] &amp; has hair to her
                    shoulders &amp; can nearly walk. Very bright.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Excellent lunch &amp; plenty talk.</p>
                <p>Went to look at new apt. for Joathey must move to something cheaper than $250 per
                    month.</p>
                <p>Picked up phone at Joan's to see how long it would take to call Rella at Laguna
                    Beach 9675 and had her in less than a minute. Grand talking to my honey again
                    &amp; connection excellent. Arranged to go by plane on 27th after going to see
                    Aunt Bessie [who lived in Northampton, MA]. Told Rella to reconfirm United Air
                    Lines Ticket as they didn't know about the reservation in N.Y.</p>
                <p>Back to Knickerbocker &amp; gave Cal, Kay &amp; Joan &amp; Bernadette each pearl
                    necklaces. Pat at hotel &amp; Ural too &amp; he has to work on clearing
                    Gripsholm passengers. So Pat joined us for a show &amp; dinner at Joan's. Went
                    looking up a show I've wanted to see &amp; got seats for Sons of Fun[?] with
                    Olsen &amp; Johnsosuccessor to Hells A Poppin. Got to Joan's &amp; shortly Ural
                    called to say he was through work so Pat lefjust as we were to have dinner. So
                    we gave her her ticket to turn in, otherwise we'd have been stuck with it.</p>
                <p>Joan's husband Bernard a very fine sort of Frenchman. Very worried that Americans
                    aren't taking the war seriously and rightly so too.</p>
                <p>Bernard not doing so well in brokerage here &amp; plans to go to B.A. this fall
                    to carry on where his family has been located for 125 yrs. But Joan can't go
                    with him, worse luck.</p>
                <p>Sons o' Fun was good but not as good as Hells a Poppin. Slapstick &amp; literally
                    roll'em in the aisle stuff.</p>
                <p>Blackout in N.Y. was a dim out, what I saw of it. Eclipse of moon when we got out
                    of theatre at midnighmoon red to boot.</p>
                <p>Bought a Wed. papeN.Y. Times tonight &amp; so to bed. Cost $2.25 for 1 night
                    single at Knickerbocker and very handy hotel.</p>

                <p>Anne Warner's Notes</p>
                <p>My father abbreviated many words. Also, within a section, once he had spelled out
                    a name, he usually abbreviated it thereafter.</p>
                <p>Some Abbreviations:</p>
                <p>arr. = arrive or arrange B.A. = Buenos Aires although occasionally it may stand
                    for British Ambassador <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/> Br. = British Br. A. =
                    British Ambassador C.A. = probably Christian Association, maybe Consular Annex
                    C.G. = Consul General Ch. or Champ = Champeau or ChampouSwiss Consul D.E.I. =
                    Dutch East Indies dips = diplomats F.I.C. = French Indochina G. or Guth =
                    Guthnecht or GudinaSwiss Vice Consul Hk = Hongkong inc. = including J. =
                    Japanese J. T &amp; A. = Japanese Times and Advertiser ken = kencho = local
                    government office L.M. = Lorenzo Marques M = thousand MM = million P.I. =

                    America Sh. = Shanghai T. = usually Tower; sometimes Tokyo V.C. = vice consul
                    Yoko. = Yokohama</p>
                <p>He sometimes left blank spaces, probably meant to fill in later. Sometimes I
                    leave a blank space, sometimes a line _______.</p>
                <p>If he didn't know how to spell a proper noun (and sometimes, I think, when he
                    did), he tended to spell it phonetically, and sometimes varied the spellini.e.
                    Suarez became Soares, Jose became Hose.</p>
                <p>After I identify an individual the first time his or her name appears, I
                    generally don't identify him or her again.</p>
